JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before being named FBI, and the story involves dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, the Gangsters of the Forbidden Heroes, the German and Japanese spies of the Second World War, and so on. years of history; far superior to any films made these days. Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington, DC. In a 20-minute film scene - where James Stewart finds out from Vera Miles that he is expecting their first child, the scene was filmed in the Herzog seafood restaurant on the former Washington coast, the only film in which historical location appears. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy ruled that Southwest Washington, a 99% Black neighborhood, was an eye and should be broken. By decree falling into his undisputed royalty, the entire area, including the popular seafront district, with the exception of 3 historic churches; was reduced to debris. Black evacuees from their homes moved as well as without federal assistance; enterprises have also simply been removed from the business, few localizations. The Row Restaurant was turned into a pavement, and Washington had no water shores (restaurants, seafood stalls, boats, etc.) for about 10 years. As a lifelong resident, the Herzog Restaurant scene was our first reason to see this great movie again.
