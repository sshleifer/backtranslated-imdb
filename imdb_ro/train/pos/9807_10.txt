I remember this series so well. It was great - such strong and convincing, stylish and sexy characters ... and so different from anything else offered at the time - and now ... I'm sure he also inspired Canadian dramaturgy "Traders." <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD 2 in the UK. It's a treatment to watch the series again. Season 1 is 13 episodes, and Season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. Sometimes you can get it special at Amazon.co.uk
