Ya. That's what I think. Sure was another great show with John in it, but I personally think it's much better without. I like to have CJ and grandpa living at home because they are so funny together. > <br /> When John was still around, I did not laugh as much as I did now. It's too bad they are not done anymore. (I do not think ...) because I would like to see something new. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. the poor Rory is almost always left out. It's always about Bridget or about Carrie. WHAT IS RORY !!! ??? Honestly, this is a great show, and for anyone who has never seen it, you have to go and watch it. You almost guarantee that you will laugh. even chuckles.
