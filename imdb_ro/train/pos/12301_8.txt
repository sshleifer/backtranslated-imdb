It's kind of crazy, but I have recorded from MsM both the German version of MGM's "Anna Christie" and the English version ... but I first saw this because I heard that many people thought it was more well than the English version. Without seeing the other, I can not compare them, but anyway this is an excellent early talk with a direct performance from the heart of Garbo. She looks very beautiful in this movie, her face shines over time, especially when cameraman William Daniels gets those wonderful pictures of her. The atmosphere of the film seems to be different from the usual MGM at that time, and it is very much like the French or German Expressionist films of the thirties, well directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who directed Garbo in 1929 in The Kiss. <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and offers an absolutely credible performance like Anna's lover, the tough, hot, tough sailor who is just a child in the human body. Hans Junkermann also gives a very good interpretation, such as Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel, as an old cheap flood. In all the experience, because it is the only movie you can listen to Garbo, I speak in a foreign language ... "because all the other films he made either in Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Hero.
