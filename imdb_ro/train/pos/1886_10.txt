I loved this movie ever since its debut in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw it! Never make me laugh or cheer me if I feel down. The three causes are fantastic, and the script is invaluable, plus you do not get nostalgia to hear the theme song? I think I read this movie without understanding it. I know the whole scenario, so when someone first looks at it, I have to stop saying something about how funny the next line is. I can not even narrow it down, though Sir John's character is probably the most memorable. The famous "I'll alert the media," when Arthur announces her intention to make a bath is still invaluable, but the list is really endless. The scene is at Arthur's father's house soon to be the fiance's father, a scream, especially his interactions with the old man. Make a favor and watch this movie!
