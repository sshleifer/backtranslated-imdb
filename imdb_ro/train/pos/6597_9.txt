We always look at American films with their specific accents in each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same thing here. All foreign people have to look at this film and have an open mind to accept another culture, except for Americans and Europeans almost dominating the cinema industry. This film tells us about a parallel world, even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confusing world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share their world. It's a great movie and the worst thing is that a rent is even at home.
