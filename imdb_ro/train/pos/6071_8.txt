I say it does not matter how much I'm looking for I will never find a better version of the "Othello" movie. If you love Kenneth Branagh's wonderful masterpieces "The Crowd of Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), as much as I am, I'm sure you'll find Oliver Parker's irresistible "Othello." Laurence Fishburne starred in splendid roles throughout his career. It was pretty cool in the movie "Boys in the Hood" (1991) - I always considered Furious Styles' funny role as his greatest achievement. That was, of course, before seeing this. He plays Othello and is probably the most difficult part of his entire career, but he does a brilliant and fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just phenomenal in a very fascinating role of corruption, manipulating the negative character Iago. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's ingenious works. He deals with his favorite subjects: wandering, envy, deception and jealousy. This adaptation of the film is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen, relying on William Shakespeare's plays.
