An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of Nimh's Secret and Land Before Time, it was a very bitter funny cartoon. I remember very well since childhood, it was funny, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that has escaped the pound and is killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven and returns. But she gets sweet when she gets in love with an orphan girl who can talk to the animals. Some scenes were a bit scary, unlike other cartoons, such as Charlie's dream sequence, but everything was fine and the pieces were correct. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love this guy, ahhehehe. And Judith Barsi de Jaws Revenge, maybe God resting his soul, the poor girl, is not worth dying, but now it's in Heaven, all good people go to Heaven. Generally, this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to put the anime shame and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And you know, if you have the original movie about it, you'll find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, you have to love that guy, ahhehehe.
