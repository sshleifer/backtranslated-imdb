This was a very good film, and it is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account when it was released. There are some films that do not get old, but this is clearly outdated. However, I saw this movie when I was a boy, and for more than twenty years, the pictures as a story were unforgettable to me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as a topic of several discussions and meetings where the old boys talk about the things we have in common. Therefore, there was a little feeling of disappointment and sadness when we finally had the DVD. First, there was a theory about how our naive generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would appreciate the fact that this film has something that should be exciting for all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on degrading horror. This is mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the film; the fact that a human being is mutilated produces a deeper thrill than death and torture. I remember how sick the sensation was when the monster broke it on Kurt's arm. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of vein. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that predominates without decomposing in intensity through all scenes, whether the action takes place in a secret lab, on a lonely street where the man in a car seeks a female body, a dressing room, and so on. Maybe the reasons why it's no longer a good movie are just technical stuff. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man who saves the fianc√©'s head, a more accurate work done for another modern director of the second unit might be interesting. The same for all scenes of action, including Kurt's arm. In addition, something could be done with the monster make. Some remakes have been good; I think an attempt would deserve in this case. However, black and white tones should be preserved.
