The question is, maybe a fun movie really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I got this at a 99 cent-old video store simply because of the title and the fact that the tape had the words "Vestron Pictures" on it (Vestron was very much appreciated as a sign of quality yet at the first he got the legendary films "Suburbia" and "1984 Class"). We did not expect a winning movie like it was. Your basic vote is as follows: Grange, this Goombian bomber on planet Earth, overthrows the "moon's shore" and is sentenced to a criminal colony on a distant planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) and other minerals. The "Governor" of the said colony and the owner of the mine exploits prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of the three on the planet), reminds prisoners that there is no escape because there is only one shuttle across the planet and they should deal with it. Then he is called the "Colonel," a reward hunter who suffers from a revolting nightmare. Much of the cinematic centers around the "futurist" car chases (dunebuggies with sidewalk slapped), with explosions enormous. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other industrial posts inside. But what makes the movie really shine is a surprisingly wonderful soundtrack with more LA punk bands from the mid-1980s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has ever been pressed on vinyl, but it really deserves to buy the movie just for the soundtrack. I do not even remember the names of the bands (listed in credits) other than the Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I heard before I saw the movie, but I certainly look at them. In principle, the movie is certainly not a waste of time and it would be best to enjoy a pack of 12 beers and some of your closest friends.
