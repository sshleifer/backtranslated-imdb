In 1985 (the year of my birth), Steven Spielberg directed an emotional and unforgettable story of an African-American Celie (debut Whoopi Goldberg), whose life is being watched by heavy times. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a smaller sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. A widow sees his eyes on Nettie, but his father gives it to Celie. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men, and especially African-American women, their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a real story of survival. "The Purple Color" is a masterpiece and an underestimated film from Spielberg. He should do more drama that "The Purple Color" and "Schindler's List" are a good idea. The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a funny comedy, but the lead role as Celie is a remarkable word he can really pull from heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly ugly "sir." I've never seen him in such a bad role. The Oprah Winfrey talk show icon is brilliant as a powerful Sofia. <br /> <br /> Attention! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when you watch this movie. You can really connect with the story of the strong union. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers, as I have with my sister. Great applause for Mr. Spielberg!
