Neither the total disaster that British critics have sustained, nor the misunderstood masterpiece his fans insist on, Revolver, is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a small substance to his conquest traps. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious movie that stings more than it can chew, especially one that uses the gangster / con-artist. As one can expect from Luc Besson's name in terms of credits as a producer, there is a clear element of the film "Cinema of Look" about him: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world in which America and Britain overlap, looks great, edited and designed sequences of action and style of oozes, all of which mark it as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie wants to do more than recite her own movies for a quick bouquet and spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything, his problem is that he tries to throw too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a drop of Godard, a lot of chess principles), motives and techniques, dabbing the screen with quotes: the movie was originally meant to end with three minute epigrams on the corpses of victims of the crowd, and sometimes feels like he would never read a fortune cookie he did not want to turn into a movie. Rather than an advertisement for Kabbalism, it is indeed more a mixture of overlapping principles of commerce, chess, and truancy, which for the most part removes the difficult trick of making accessible theosophy while concealing the central cone ( somewhat metaphysical) <br /> The third third is where most problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) inside with a lot of ambitious but not always complete cross-crossing success to bravado contrast outside of people with inner fear and anger, but has much to do for everything. It's not worth a new religion, but I'm surprised she did not get a US distributor. Perhaps they found Ray Lothta's fake intentional tank, even too scary?
