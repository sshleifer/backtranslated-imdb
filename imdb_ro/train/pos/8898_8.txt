The 60s is a wonderful movie (I've seen it all in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 1960s. Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 1960s are not really important in this film. The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on the US road against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (a surprise!). He returns from war and changes to a "Tom Cruise Born July 4" In a hippy.This father is a type of pro-Vietnam war (a surprise!). Michael Kate's sister gets pregnant from a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco in the summer of love. The conclusion is very poor (the father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I let him get rid of my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant. All the main events of the sixties are in the film, such as JFK and Martin Luther King's murders, as well as big hippy protests, summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely for Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first-aid employee at the Woodstock Festival! Finally, the 60s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
