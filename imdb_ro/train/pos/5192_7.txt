I'm a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies full of gun games on top. Now the martial arts; *That's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here producing a very fun Kung Fu movie that almost fought * too much * if such a thing is possible! This thing is good. Many of the battle scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are fun and enjoyable. Bad guys are a bit too bad, but not less fun. You have to see Wizard Sleeping! He can only fight when he is asleep - it is hysterical! With repeated views, however, Last Hurray For Chivalry may tend to become a little bit boring and long, too, especially because many scenes of fighting actually not so good. That's why I appreciate it "only" a 7 out of 10. But it's really a "8". Everything in all the best kung fu movies made a dab in the heart of the kung fu cinemas. All really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late 1970s, with some notable exceptions from the late 1960s and early 1970s (and the early 1980s, to be fair).
