Not on the same level as the Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror shot. I want North American horror producers to take a page out of the Japanese horror pattern and put more "spookiness" and less cheap shocks into their movies. A lot of good examples in this case, the scenes in which a bright face is a scene that looks behind a young actress, the photos on a wall are suddenly looking smiling, for only a second and more. It's worth checking out if you like the genre.
