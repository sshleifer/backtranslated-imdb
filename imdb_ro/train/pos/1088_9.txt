Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly distributed as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown up by countless complications and a burst of initial budget. There is a lot of laughter (even if the story is somewhat slim) to entertain star fans or the style of Hollywood comedy in the 1940s. Particular attention comes when a contractor goes through a drain of all spending, which must have sounded pretty Excessive to an audience since 1948. When he makes his exit, he assures the client (Grant) that he could get a $ 100.00 discount of the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
