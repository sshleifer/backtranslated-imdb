"Bruce Almighty" will win the Academy Awards with a record of 14 Academy Awards! It will surpass the titanic as the biggest cash of all times! Jim Carrey's image will be so overwhelming that he will announce his presidential bid for the White House playoffs since 2004. Almighty then! These fantasies of greatness could only prove to be true if filmmakers (including Carrey) possess the powers of God. The same premise is the primal ingredient of Bruce Almighty. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor he holds God to be totally guilty of his own controversy. Heavenly God, interpreted by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the "gift of God" (his powers) to convince them if he can do the work of God better. Obviously, Bruce moves away with his happy faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey returns in the comic form of Bruce Almighty. Jennifer Aniston was not "inappropriate" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my kudos prime minister goes to director Tom Shadyac for not letting his dog out of the house for number two and showing us the world's most hilarious bathing scene! "Bruce Almighty" is not Carrey's deepest film, but it's still an appealing, Carreyism-inspired exhibition! **** Good
