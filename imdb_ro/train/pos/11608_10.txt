This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I see that I'm not the only one who shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, made the end of her heart and memorable. In the hands of a younger actress, her last scene would have seemed burned and burned. He would never guess that this film was made on a limited and limited budget. The cinema is gorgeous and there are a large number of name actors. The script is so wonderful, I see why everyone wanted to be in it. If you follow the long and long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii has been on the scene to make this movie happen for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the movie. My only "complaint" is that I almost do not want the movie to end.
