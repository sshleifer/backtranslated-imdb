Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. Her inheritance is a remarkable group of movies that will live forever, as in The Shop around the Corner. This film has been remodeled in other less distinctive films and a musical piece without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own and definitive version. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart have worked together in several films. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of being in a movie without appearing almost at all. Both stars are delightful as friends who do not know each other but who has made them work together in the same store in Budapest. The reason these classic movies have worked so well is the amazing support of casting studios put together in the picture by image. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the shop owner. We also see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work to make us believe we are in Budapest. That's why these movies will live forever!
