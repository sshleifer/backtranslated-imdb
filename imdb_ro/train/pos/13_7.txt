Production quality, the award, the authentic local New England (Waterbury, CT?) And John Williams's lush score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collection. Unfortunately, everything I received was a "decent" 2-star movie, memorable for what she's been trying to do ......... brings a mainstream movie in the style of the art house. The local city and the story of ordinary people is a genre in itself, and if well done, it will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda could not hide her soul enough to make her character credible. I wondered why he was not doing a doctorate at Yale instead of working at a Waterbury plant. Robert DiNiro's character was just a bit too controversial. An unrecognizable, beautiful pattern that turns out to be, with little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. This genre was better managed by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-90s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt". I want mainstream studios to try out more things for post-teens and reserve a few screens at multi-cinema complexes for these efforts. I give her an "A" for effort.
