Despite some reviews that were distinct from Luke-hot, I found the story totally worrying and even if some critics described the love story as "Mills and Boon," so what? It is good to see a warm and moving story about real love in these cynical times. Many of the audience have noticed and plunged their eyes. You really think young Victoria and Albert love passionately, though, for political reasons, it was a marriage arranged. Still, I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, was probably played too much like a pantomime bastard. As it is rumored that he was actually Victoria's true father (following an adventure with her mother Duce of Kent), it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, caught in the suffocating palace, with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. It shines brightly with the power of character and determination that made Victoria a great queen of England who has thrived like never before, under her long reign. I think mouth recommendations will provide great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful film.
