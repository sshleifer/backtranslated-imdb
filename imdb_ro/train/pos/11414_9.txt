A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is gorgeous as "Phoebe," Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "coach," and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine." Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts it in good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her very first lead. This movie is directed by Jo-Beth Williams. Editing is the first rate.
