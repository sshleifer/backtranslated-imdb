I love this movie so much! The animation is great (for a Pokémon movie), the cgi looks so great. I like music from the movie. So great they kept Japanese music. As for the story: it's great. She has a sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful Pokémon. Ash is really great in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing he did not like was Suicu's appearance, he suddenly appeared, helped Ash & co and left. They could have made his role in the movie a little bigger. But in general, great movie! You can not wait to have your own US version on DVD!
