I saw this movie when the Mystery Science Theater fled in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad, in fact, that by strange simplicity, this film has to be rated as ten because it has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote this scenario with kids in mind should be beaten. I mean, indeed, the Devil vs. Santa Claus? Visions of Hell? Crazy dog ​​laughing laugh? Forced labor of children with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. How Crow exclaims during the MST3K showing: "This is a good nightmare nightmare" There is a lot of strange clue and theology has hurt. Merlin (probably Arthurian Merlin) is in a dream with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (that is, in Heaven). Santa Claus talks about the baby Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for the children who ask for brothers. There are symbols around the castle that look like pentagrams or stars of the RAF. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been watching him every year since 1993 and obey anyone we can keep down for 2 hours to look with us.
