After seeing the short "Batman Dead End", I did not know what to expect at World's Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All the best comic books of my world have made them the team. After seeing this trailer for three and a half minutes, it made me want someone to make a serial film for the best film of the world, if not a real feature film. Sure, some of Superman's things were cheesy, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the whole product. This seems to require a complete product. Apart from the direction of Sandy Collera, playing a Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie had been made, actors would be thrown out to fit into the film bill, though I think Nina Kaczorowski would do a good Lois Lane, especially if he had a closer dialogue to character. <br /> <br /> Good to see Clark Bartram wearing Deadman's Batman Costume, but it should be upgraded a bit more and not be like the 40s Batman with the head and hood of the 80's - 90. His conduct is Batman, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses, instead of letting his eyes look through the mask. I think the aim was to get as close to comic character as the character of the film. Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He stands, with a strange look on his face, who simply says, "Punch me." And the delivery of lines seems to be a problem with him. Generally, however, I would love to see a complete story and a film based on this ingenious work. It was a rumor about the best movie in the world that was done, and with the right additions to the script, that could be. I hope more are done.
