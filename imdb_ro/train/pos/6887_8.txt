This is a unique and bold movie. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. <br /> <br /> I like directors who are not afraid to ask the public to think ... Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions and dig under the surface. By the nature of the film, he basically asks the viewer to look inside. It may take some courage to do that. I can see how some close people can find this quite disturbing. However, I found it challenging, much more than just entertainment. Bret Carr is truly an original, visionary director. I'm curious to see what he's going to do next. Watch it.
