I did not read this book, but the movie was awake with one thought in my head: That's Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, all the intelligence and the life behind a novel, translated so well to film. This film had the same complexities found in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often significant and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character portrayed perfectly by Nick Nolte. He had all the signs of a Vonnegut's "hero": lack of worry about political boundaries, dark ironic humor, giving way to a simple inaction in response to stress and a lack of desire to push his version of reality to those around him . > <br /> In general, I was constantly surprised and impressed while watching this movie. It was the same feeling that I read "Cat's Cradle," my first Vonnegut novel, as if it were the most peculiar thing that could happen, thought about THAT and made it real and important . Yes, he has nothing but "White Christmas" army surplus albums. So it goes!
