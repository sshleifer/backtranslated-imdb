"What would you do?" is a question that will stay in mind for a few weeks after watching the Brokedown emotional palace. You will also be wondering if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a problem that has remained unresolved and rightly so. This is a particularly well-behaved and beautiful shot movie. Although it is sometimes slow, its rhythm reflects the story line - but a lot of film will put you on the edge of the seat; who want to know what's going on. The end will also let you imagine in the shoes of lead characters that are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is commendable.
