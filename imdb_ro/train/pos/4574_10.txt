Let me say from the beginning that I have cerebral palsy and I went into this film, waiting to have to take into account the lead performance. I left the theater half convinced they threw an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, even though I knew it was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special sign for Brenda Fricker and for Hugh O'Conner (I think it was his name) like the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant - in other words, human. This movie, along with Gaby: A true story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent representations of life with the CP. It is by no means a complete portrait, but a fine example of people with disabilities as human beings. Most recommended.
