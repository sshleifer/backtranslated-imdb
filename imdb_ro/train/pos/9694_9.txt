I was entranced by this exciting and hilarious film, not to be surprised. I was also surprised to learn that Paulie's voice was interpreted by Jay Mohr. The show was so fine, it did not even change in schmaltz, nor did it get too hard under the jargon of New Jersey that I thought it must be a fresh pro, not Mr. Mohr. An impressive performance, indeed, and it's nice to see the talents taken seriously in a string of strange, indie movies.
