George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand-up comedy and still does not. But this show is a work of art. Never show up where jokes you keep laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re-memorable on that). This show has only an optimistic look and the characters range from an old drink, short to a dyslexic adolescent. I do not know who writes this show, but that person does a great job. If the show just went on, I'm sure it will get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the Bel-Air's fresh Prince is "Will Smith". OK man! But otherwise, this show is genius! 10/10
