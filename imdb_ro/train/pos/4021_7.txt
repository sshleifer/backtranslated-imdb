A complex story set against the background of Bharat's partition. An honest Muslim kidnapping an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - yet, in the end, you both liked both. The story is strong, yet the scenario and the flow hesitate. Background music and songs are remarkable. Next comes a memorable act by veteran Urmila Matondkar. The photo captures the time, violence and flavor of rural Punjab. Other actors did not act well or did not have the chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. The characters have not been developed well. It is not clear, unlike "Earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a sign. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different endings - and all could have been just as good.
