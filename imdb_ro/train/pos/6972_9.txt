The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is exactly the same as the DVD release. As has been said, Episode 01 offers a very important asset to the highly popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both the original and the remake of 2007). Applies significantly to the 2007 series. As is the case in recent years, sci-fi models are reviewing, this series explores life or the "virtual" environment. Additionally, we are given a lot of details about the Adama family line, as well as about their relationship with the Cylon creator, which has not been discovered (in the Battlestar Galactica series). For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular subject of "virtual" life and (as expected) at the beginning of colonial life and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Everywhere, I enjoyed this episode. Although it was not a new material for me or someone who has already seen the launch of the Caprica's DVD, the series seems very promising. As with many pilots, Episode 01 leaves us with a hanger so as to ensure a follow-up by an audience (the science fiction community). I will certainly continue to pursue both judgment and development. <br /> <br /> I give this 8-star series.
