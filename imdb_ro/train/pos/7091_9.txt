The big issue is where to get started because this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and you do not waste a few minutes to get a coke because there is a danger you can not follow. But there's also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to travel in a timemachine to find antivirus for a virus that ran the animals around the world in 1996. Due to mistakes, he first arrived in 1990, then in World War I and how disturbed he was, Terry Gilliam comes with what must be one of the smartest scripts ever. This ex-man Monty Phyton knows exactly how SF genius is supposed to be, and that his cast cast could not have been better, there is crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a gorgeous Bruce Willis who proves that is more than a Schwarzenegger, he wants to be. It's a movie you can always watch, because the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can watch it) that every visit gives you other surprises. One of my great favorites.
