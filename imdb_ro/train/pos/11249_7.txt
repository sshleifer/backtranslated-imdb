I just watched the 6 episodes on DVD. The action throughout is excellent - no doubt. There was not enough action for me, I have to say. No real suspense as such, just plenty of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like a good slow story and carefully said then this is for you. Peter Egan as leader Magnus Pym is excellent. The film illustrated the life of a traitor. A man who ought to have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so psychologically injured by his unhappy childhood that this deception has become his way of life in all things. As a child, he loved his father, but his father was exposed to time and once as a crook and con man. Pym betrayed not for ideology or money, but because he had to deceive those close to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally affected by his father's influence - he ate the moral fibers. He has no real love or loyalty in him. Heavy psychological stuff and not many moments of light in the 6-hour series. Very well done, though.
