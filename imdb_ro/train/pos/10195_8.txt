Joe Don Baker is one of a few actors that is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated. He was in a ton of movies, either as a hero or as a hero, and he has the strong, solid type of presence that Wallace Beery had made half a century before. Baker can deliver materials that would sound ridiculous from another actor, and that's so great about him. It really seems to mean what he says, no matter how clich√©, obvious or stupid, that puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and the same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. It was a substantial hit in cinemas and films in the 1980s, and it aged much better than many of the most popular action movies of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a true quality of time that does not detract from the action on the screen. To be honest, I always liked Greydon Clark's films, a senseless director in the same sense as Clint Eastwood's in the 1970s, and this is one of the best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the stones lost in the late 1980s, similar to MAN ON FIRE, in its true stones and violence. I suppose if they will resume this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love him as much as I do.
