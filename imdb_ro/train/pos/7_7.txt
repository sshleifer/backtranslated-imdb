Although I did not like Stanley & Iris as a movie, I admired the action. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here it is delicate and powerful at the same time. De Niro has the ability to do any role he performs in acting gold. He offers a great interpretation in this movie and there is a wonderful scene in which he has to take his father into a home for the elderly because he can no longer take care of him, break the heart. I would not recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I will say you will not see too many things to act anywhere.
