Superman and Mole Men are probably the most difficult adventures of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the deepest place in the world. While there are some radioactive men, they go through the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other people in the city are trying to eliminate the invading men. Can Superman change people's paths in time to save people from death? Can Superman warn people in time about the radioactive danger that people have brought to the softness? In my opinion, Superman and Mole Men are a very smart, well-written and well-designed film. Even if we get to see Superman only once, it still makes a great Superman adventure. He has to see for anyone. Stars 10/10
