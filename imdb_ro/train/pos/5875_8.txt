These are one of the movies that does not require any brain or thinking, it's a very fun passage of time that you have forgotten in the next hour or so. I was really surprised by the role of John Abraham, who usually played the gangster's face with no emotion so he played the opposite completely and did it successfully, managing to shine among comedy geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised by Akshaye's three faces, because the roles do not require much talent, but especially because of the disappearance of Akshaye (for the other girls), I was surprised that they managed to settle to become the real person and to differentiate a good thing, most of the songs are good, they are full of color and fun, so on a boring Sunday evening this will easily ease your mood.
