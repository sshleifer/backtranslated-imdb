"A Thief in the Night" is a movie that was generally ignored by movie fans generally because of its low budget (which was obvious) and its subject - The Rapture of a True Christian Church and the Fate of the Left. However, it was an exciting story that held the viewer and determined it to reestablish its relationship with Jesus Christ. He touched everyone - even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film, and its sequel "Distant Thunder," has to watch movies. Even with the launch of the new "Left Behind" series, telling the same story with a much larger budget, the impact is the same - "Thief in the Night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
