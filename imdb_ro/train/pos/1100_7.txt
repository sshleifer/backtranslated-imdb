- After getting tired of the rat race and living conditions in New York, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a home turns out to be something but simple. As headaches and bills begin to get worse, so laughs. Mr. Blanding will receive his dream house? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any one of the three is able to wear a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of me in this role. He is so good to play the role on his husband. Loy is always a joy to look at. The Thin Man movies he made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of me in the past two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a special favorite of mine. The film is certainly a product of its own time. I take a shot at imagining a time when you could build a two-story house with three bedrooms and four bathrooms on $ 15,000 a year. Throw into the fact that your two children go to private school and have a lifetime job and become almost fanciful. However, for anyone who bought or built a house, many of the situations and difficulties I find in Blanding are easy to tell until today. And here comes the comedy. How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie just to get to spend more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the subplot of the entire "wife in love with my best friend." It is not really necessary for the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as it is presented.
