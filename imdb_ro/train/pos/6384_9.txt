It's written in stone that Disney animations simply have to be musical. Right? Where? Show me. Because I discovered that this test is much more pleasant because it does not contain the five-year-old Disney music honey. <br /> <br /> While the story was not as enthusiastic as it could, it was still pretty good, enjoyable and adventurous. I was hoping a bit longer, yes, taking into account the subject, but this movie is not a bitter disappointment or total failure you have to do. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, just like the story, plot, sub-plot and amazing creativity we have found in this production. I will refrain from plotting the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie deserves a good view if you are a fan of fantasy. This is, in my opinion, the BEST Disney Animated Feature Lung Film. <br /> <br /> It's a rate of 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
