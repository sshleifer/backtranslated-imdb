The thirty horror films that are best mentioned are always like Dracula and Frankenstein; and there is a very good reason for that, but there have been a number of smaller but still excellent productions, and Ray Invisible is certainly one of them. The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen several times before (even back in 1936) but the way everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a wonderful, very small film , horror. The plot focuses on Dr. Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth. His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa, and so he starts with a team of colleagues to find him. However, the tragedy strike during the expedition and good doctor becomes exposed to the element; which makes him shine in the dark and also sends him mad ... The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it represents the two great horror stars of the day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both offers excellent performance. Karloff really shows what a good actor is and that his character has a lot of meat to impress Karloff. Bela Lugosi has an extremely different role from what we are used to seeing and is a great interpretation of it; it's nice to see a little versatility from Lugosi. The film starts at a slow start; but things start to rise. The second half of the movie is the best and even when the movie becomes interesting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not focus on big special effects and relies heavily on the central character's actions to keep things interesting; and it works very well. The film remains interesting and pours down to a very decent climate, which spreads everything nicely. In general, Ray invisible can not be one of the best horror films of the 1930s; but it is very good and recommended.
