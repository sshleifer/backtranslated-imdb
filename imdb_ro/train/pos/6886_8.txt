This is different from any other film, the closest thing I can compare to a Woody Allen movie ... But where, while Woody Allen constantly understands human fakes, Bret Carr seems to try to find a way to deal with a criminal insecurity that tends to define us better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to a single child Hood trauma, which is revealed by the back of the flash. There are so many strange neurotic people in the world, and I think all of them deserve a chance for redemption, although the diversity of human character is, after all, what makes the world a place so exciting, so maybe it should not we repair the neurosis more than we should fix our nose or chest. /> <br /> This is an indie film shot over a long time, but the production values ​​are extraordinary as the field of the film. I feel like a strange Gem for the self-help market. I look forward to seeing what this director does, I could imagine a career alongside Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, though usually when a guy like this breaks out, he goes out and makes "X MEN "and his odd humility the origins are forgotten soon or they are .... X Men is a lot of strange if I remember correctly :)
