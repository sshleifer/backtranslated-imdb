From time to time, in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are crafted, and one gets completely horrified by its shining brightness. This is no less than a diamond! This is a movie full of astonishment, anticipation coldness and dark atmosphere and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror films of all time! And, of course, it probably contains the greatest sequence, the fullest, in the history of horror! Every time I see the movie and get to where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm scared of my intelligence, but it never happens; I'm never right and I find myself terrorized the first time I saw him! Now, it has to be said that in order to scare a fan of this horror, it is nothing but pure perfection. Unlike Americans, the British know their subtleties, boast the art of acting, do not need a special effect to convey the atmosphere, rely on the power of the powerful story, and the humility (in this case) of suggestion and anticipation. Each element is impeccable, from the set pieces, from acting, to story, to the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran could make the devil drink, that's for sure! As a final note, if for a demented reason you do not like this madness, then you honestly do not know what horror it is and, frankly, do not deserve to know it. Thank you!
