One of Cary Grant's most durable comedies is Mr. Blandings, who builds his dream home. Though judging by its size, the home would be a dream house today. Still Cary was making a good living in advertising, even though he was with a devil a while trying to come up with a slogan for Wham's branded ham. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the lack of housing years after World War II years. War veterans claimed their rights under the Intellectual Property Rights Act, which also included home loans. The problem was that literally there were not enough houses to meet demand. Around the time that Eric Hodgins's book and the film were so popular Congress adopted and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which put the government for the first time in home construction business. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt who, at the same time, built their own house that they moved in the early fifties. Just like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy had two daughters and were looking to get out of Rochester's inner city. Their place was not as big as a home in Connecticut, with eighteen rooms, still lived there for the rest of their lives, the way Cary and Myrna most likely did. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive, and the costs continue to gather and multiply, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas to offer advice, usually too late. The truth must be said to be kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine moving Charles to the countryside and William Powell who have headaches done by Cary Grant, the film will still work very well. <br /> <br /> Blandings builds his Dream House still works well as comedy, because situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate, who have lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.
