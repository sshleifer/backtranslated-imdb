Although Stardust seems to be a fantastic movie with predictable finishes and average performance, it certainly is not. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure film. It has this magic "aura" from the beginning to the end of the movie. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of the chair. Like any story, she has something of morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that evil brothers will not take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome any obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, a material girl that is superficial and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to grant additional credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this glow that fits perfectly into her character. Moreover, she and Cox have chemistry that makes romanticism in the movie more notable. The other distributors are well-known actors and actresses who, of course, make Stardust an interesting and "high class" movie. In general, the movie is FANTASTIC, magical locations and interesting plot. was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for that.
