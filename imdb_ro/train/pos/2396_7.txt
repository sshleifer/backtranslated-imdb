This is a very fun movie following Macbeth's NY production rehearsal. Although he has a lot to say about the power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's themes) in our modern world, the movie works best when it's not taken seriously. Famous actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens, and David Lansbury make beautiful roles in the lead, but the most important thing for me was the hilarious scene that repeated the "assassination" of Banquo (John Elsen). Probably a more fun movie for those involved in the theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
