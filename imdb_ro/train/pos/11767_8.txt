What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with many ups and downs. James Belushi is very good as a bull who stole 12 million from the boss who must deal with the gangsters, worry his wife and local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jumping on board and enjoying the journey. 8 out of 10
