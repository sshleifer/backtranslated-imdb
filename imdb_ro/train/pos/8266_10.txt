This, the best achievement of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Social Realism, is based on a tragedy in early 1906, which claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners, because a burst of deep coal dust in me at Courrieres, in the north of France, took place after a three-week fire, finally releasing the deadly gas that caused the deaths. Estimated designer Erno Metzner creates strict sets that simulate the tragedy, giving a perception of reality, enhanced by soundless editing, the only music being produced by orchestras at the beginning and finishing portions of a work for which the phonetic effects are of equal importance to the compositions fascinating visuals of the eminent director. Pabst's "invisible editing", which deals with shooting action through player movements, turns out to be seamlessly integrated into this movie, featuring sublime cinema using camera-mounted cameras, allowing the director to go on stage without the need for cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the paper refers to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is supported in its details, born out of Pabst's unmistakable talent of weaving numerous lines of plot in a cinematic tapestry that urges admirers of German rescue, very proud while not less desperate for disastrous losses to the families of French victims; surely a fully stimulating seminal triumph today for a movie star as it was when it was first released.
