For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. Well, last summer, we both followed together and decided I was wrong. The first is a better Care Bears movie (as you probably guessed if you read my review for it). This is not a BAD movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. Well, first of all, as some people have mentioned, it completely opposes the knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another sequel that contradicts the original so flagrant (especially with the genres of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and I was looking at this, I was pretty confused and distracted. I felt the same thing as an adult! Because of why the movie is actually pretty good (if you disassociate it from the first movie). I can not think of another movie for little children with DEMON, like villan! Now I'm not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of Bears campsites and caregivers are good, I'm just sorry there is an EXCELLENT WINE in a movie for little children! It's like the bizarre movie "Santa Clause vs. Satan" in Mexico that you sometimes hear. <br /> <br /> However, the name of the demon is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get Bears in care to give him special powers. Very dark for a children's film? And I mentioned that Darkheart appears most often as a WHO VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY ??? Strange! Meanwhile, other children are in Care-a-Lot who are dealing with babies with child care! Oh man! Demons and baby babies in the same movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything is clear in the end (but not before Darkheart gets trapped souls Care Bears in this frightening chandelier in a deeply disturbing scene (surprising). But I was left with the question that this film found the public of worship it deserves so rich. I might just look myself myself.
