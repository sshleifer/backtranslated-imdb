The performances of each actor and actress (in the film) are excellent NATURAL, which should be what the film should be; and driving talent is so brilliantly treated on every detail that I never get tired of ever seeing it. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, Attenborough's puzzling credits: are they not proud to say that they have made an excellent and long-lasting film for the public? I hope to get some answers to my puzzles from some (possibly one of the "insider" staff of the movie.
