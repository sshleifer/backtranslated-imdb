This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that the money is not enough, so he rents the family that lives where he believed his family was doing. O.K? This is a very small high school soap, PG-13, but small sexual references are comedy, so if your child can not handle them, they can not live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a piece and, as usual, goes through this fun, GMO, remember when I did ... assemble the piece as if it were at the final stage of a neuroinfectious diseases. But it's okay, because even this old Oracle continues to hope that if Ben is well proportioned along, well, there is hope for us ladies. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - complements and keeps this Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas, alternately, hilarious, comfortable and warm. This movie is the kind you can jump and popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to support him to show you what you've lost. happy film, after all, and lets you feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
