This is the stupid movie of a man of thought. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, this can turn into a classic classic for you, as it does for my wife and myself - from casting the voice of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Martians to the too simplistic population of Big Bean, this is a movie that you can sleep or watch carefully and enjoy in any way. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy the easy relaxing humor you take a quick mind to see the joke as you slide, you will enjoy this movie.
