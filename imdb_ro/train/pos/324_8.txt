I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did. I took it because I saw it on the list of the most controversial 25 movies of all time. It did not look great. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most ingenious composite films of recent memories. It's about a twenty-year-old woman who wants to know everything. Stores all the information it collects in an enormous archive. She experiences experience in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film team is shown making the film and seeing their reactions to the story and to each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film in the US, while its seizure by the customs authorities was attacked. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary that tells us the world behind the scenes of filmmakers during the narrative, the fourth wall being broken. This movie is the most direct way to make a movie I've ever seen. The film works predominantly as a time capsule of psychedelic activities in the 1960s, the fight against freedom and sexual release. I like to think about it much more than that. I did not think I'd like to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but actually, I'm actually doing that. This movie is a buried treasure. Try.
