Offering such an impressive show, which seems to be almost Mad Mad Mad Mad of Horror, "The Sentinel" (1977) is a really creepy film that focuses on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this case, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is (and I do not think I'm giving too much at this late date) very close to the gate of hell. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers much worse conditions than drainage and occasional water disease to put it lightly! Indeed, the scene in which Alison meets her noisy neighbor up is really terrifying and should certainly send shiny ice water to the crowd of most viewers. In spite of many criticisms of Raines' ability to act, I thought it was okay, more than just taking their own in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon, and Eli Wallach . The image is based on a careful, careful conclusion, and although some scrutiny points are inexplicable, I was left to feel more than satisfied. As the DVD Delirium says, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as top cannibal lesbians in t-shirts can not be bad!" On a side note, yesterday I went to 10 Terta Montague in Brooklyn Heights to have a look at Casa Sentinel. Yes, he is still there, and although he is shot by the grass and missing a blind priest at the top floor window, it looks the same as in the picture above. If this house really stands at the entrance to hell, I think hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we, New York, I knew that for some time!
