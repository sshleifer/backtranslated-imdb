ROCK N ROLL High School has a special place in my heart, because it introduced me to Ramones. I was too young in the glory of the band in the mid-70s to be very conscious of them, although I had a bigger cousin that was a great fan of time. I finally saw RNRHS on television after an afternoon in the mid-80s when I was about fifteen, and I was laughing all over. (Is not the dream of every high school kid to tear off his school and blow him up all over a soundtrack?) We recorded a subsequent broadcast of the movie a year or two later and watched the Ramones concerts and Again, thinking, "Man, these boys are kicking! I have to check some albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, many Ramones LPs / Cassettes / CDs and three Ramones show later, I'm still one of my favorite bands of all time, and RNRHS breaks me every time I look at it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R. R. All) at least we have this movie and many great songs to remember.
