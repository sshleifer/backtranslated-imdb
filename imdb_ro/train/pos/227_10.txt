Robert Duvall is the direct descendant of general confederate Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com database. After seeing this movie, you might think Duvall's appearance is reincarnation to the best thing. One of my most favorite films. I want the composer Peter Rodgers Melnick to have a CD or a soundtrack available. Wonderful scenery and music and "all true-to-life", especially for those of us who live in, or have moved to, the South. This is a "real moment in time". Life is moving slowly, but "strangers do not stay".
