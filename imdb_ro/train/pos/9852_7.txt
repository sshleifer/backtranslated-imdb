No day passes without a new animated computer-animated movie, so now we really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After seeing the Ice Age, I felt that it was not such a big impact on me than other films of this kind. But because I am now a great guy and I'm pretty sure it's a very good movie for kids (maybe up to 14 years old). The story is pretty simple, and the "actors" are funny in a nice way, with no gross or complex humor. Even "evil" is a lovely, fluffy cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to disappear in a sad way), but a wonderful thing for kids. And, besides some battles, no one dies (not even when he is stomped on a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoon feeling. The computer animation part is beautiful, but nothing special, apart from some really nice caricatures feelings, when you feel like going in a beautiful painting or comic book pages. [Which means a lot of work though!] There were some gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy the big ones - but I find it hard to notice and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, because it feels uncomfortable with the story. Generally, it's a beautiful movie, but it's rather the ideal style for kids-disney cliche. If you do not hate the cute animals by doing funny things, look at it at least once.
