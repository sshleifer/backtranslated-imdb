This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The movie is extraordinary, fascinating sometimes. He also received an Oscar for Best Picture, and it was worth it. I have many movies in my movie collection and a few more that I've seen beside them, and many of them are no more beautiful or even as beautiful as this. It's unique and a great general movie. The cast is extraordinary and does a great job in portraying their characters. We follow their destinies with devotion and we attach very emotionally. By the way, we also learn things about us and our lives. I think much of this film about what it represents and how it presents it. I warmly recommend it
