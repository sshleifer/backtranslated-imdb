When I was sitting in the cinema, I was in good shape and I was not going to change it. But this film is a dramatic force. I was still sweating and I needed a shower afterwards. So what do we have? Theoretically, the story of a Turkish elderly living in Copenhagen, Denmark. My mind came as soon as the plot seemed pretty borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham," where I had an Indian girl who played football and broke her sister's wedding. Here we transferred it to a Turkish girl who broke her brother's wedding into Kung Fu. And we have a story of love and competition, of course. After accepting this, it turned out to be a moving and moving drama and shows some beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). Leading actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion, but she also provides excellent performance, so it seems safe to assume we have enough autobiographical impression here considering that this is her first film and not she has an education as an actress. The rest of the support distribution is fine, the good room, the intense Kung Fu. Sidenotes: - The masculine audience in Turkey has shown respect because they have done something right. - The audience broke into the cheers when our heroine finally fought and attacked the boys who severely beat her brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese cinematic instructor / actor in Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon), played the lead role. If you have the chance to see this in cinema, you will probably have a good and intense experience and I do not know if it works on the small screen
