The British horror film was in decline until the early seventies, but out of black came three films that were among the best that our island produced. The warrior, the blood on Satan's claws and the house that demolished the blood, made the future look red, even though many people knew it would not be one. THTDB has a kind of distribution that could easily form a wish list, if it were not really assembled, in the gloomy hinterland of 2008 you might expect to wake up. Wax is the quintessential of the four stories and, of course, the most preferred, my life and Cushing's art are interconnected so firmly that you can not tell where the performance ends and the pain starts. One can only guess how this role has affected such a delicate, sensitive man. Death and Virgo. RIP Peter.
