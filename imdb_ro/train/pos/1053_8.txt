Sisters in Law are made by the same directors of "Divorce, Iranian Style", quite curious, fascinating, which was exactly as it was said because I had a look at the Iranian divorce court. They have now turned their attention to the judiciary in Cameroon, Africa. What is wonderful in this instance is that 2 of the magistrates are women, which is unusual for such a country. However, she is dealing with a lot of ordinary people to make their way around women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women seem to have made great progress in society, with the recognition of divorce rights and women's rights. So, judges often punish people because they behave in a primitive way in these times. Not to say that women who appear in the court receive the softer treatment. One of the main outbreaks of the film is a case of child abuse by an aunt. Judges do not waste time battling at the woman with anger. And who said that righteousness is no longer served? With these 2 behind the bench. They often perform maximum punishments! Ya! You're going girl!
