Looking back in the last 28 years (from my first show at the show), all I can say is: Once you have it, she will stay with you forever. I remember that my initial reaction was: 1) disturbing, 2) under production 3) inappropriate characters. Well, two years later I looked back on a few episodes and I found it almost so annoying. A year later, I managed to capture the whole series from the beginning and quickly became part of the bitter story of human vice and the prospect of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the given production value would be hard to solve now. But I still think about the show at least once a month, with a vague tear, looking for what seemed a simpler period ... BTW I'm a married man ... (for all who believe this is a show for females)
