Steve Carrel Turns out to be a great man in this wonderful, original breath of fresh air. I looked as hilariously as hilarious as it was. Basically, the title of the film says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man working at an electronics store. He is a bit stupid who loves video games and comics, and has the largest collection. His shoppers working with him find out he's a Virgo during a sex-filled sex dialog, and then Andy has to go through a funny adventure like Odiessy's sexual relatives awakening but always screwing him up to him does not lose virginity, but eventually he gets lucky at the end. Let the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this wonderful romantic animation for adults. You will be hanging from the start and, with the end, you will want to wear your extra thick absorbent garment. Just another thing I can say about this is Pity that Steve Carrel was not recognized as a man left 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best male performance over the next few years of MTV. You can bet the big dollar you earn on this, people! I give him a perfect 10!
