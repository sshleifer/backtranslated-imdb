I found this charming movie. I thought the characters had been developed since I looked, I woke up worried about these people. This is a period of time that I think has occurred during depression. A single mother, who is known as a relic (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the work for "a husband." Christopher Reeve plays an ex-cone that happens in the city looking for work. He sees the ad and goes to see it. He's hiring him. I really gave some tricks when their relationship progressed, because it was easy for me to put on shoes. Everything has gone so long. He needs work, so he does not want to suppress it. And he needs his help, but he does not want him to get his hand. They dance around that they start to need each other. Things are getting warm up ... ... the big blow. I will not hurt her by telling me what's going on. But the resolution point is perfectly wonderful. I found the story to be very credible for the time it takes. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories there. Perhaps the young generation will not "get", but if you are over 40, I think you will like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time," you'll also love him in this movie.
