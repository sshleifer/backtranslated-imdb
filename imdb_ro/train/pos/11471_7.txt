I am a great fan of the movie and I have seen this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was very interesting. The two main actors are wonderful, the film is never boring, and the concept behind it (even if it's obviously inspired by Columbine's murders and the criminals' home movies) is really exciting. There are a few weaknesses, such as the final 20 minutes, which really diminishes the realism observed in the first hour or so, and the conclusion really does not make any sense. The noise room can sometimes be a distraction, but in true cinema is once. But I think the film is very well done and director Ben Coccio deserves a credit.
