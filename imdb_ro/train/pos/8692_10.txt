I like to see this. I did not know he was part of a larger series. Probably I was about 6 years old on TV. I just thought it was funny and, for some reason, I had a deep fascination for something that was clearly in the President's bathtub toys. My parents recorded this television show when they first broadcast NBC. The band even had the old Sanka coffee advert with a few others. I'm going to come home soon and try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do this through the IMDb site you feel free. I will keep you posted and I will inform you when I will present the show in a digital format.
