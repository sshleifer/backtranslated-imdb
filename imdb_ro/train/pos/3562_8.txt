Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the longest-running floating craps game in New York and needs $ 1,000 to secure a new location. Confident in his chances, he is betting the highest role of the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not make missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Guys and Dolls (1955)" is such a great music because it combines skillfully with the contrasting styles of film and scene. During a blinding opening, crowds of pedestrians moved in pace, stopping and starting as if responding to the backstage. Even walking movements are stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a brilliant glow of color and movement of deco art, a fantasy world so completely eliminated by the fact that even the underground gambling business and criminal torture looks brilliant. <br /> <br /> While writing this review, I just got word that Jean Simmons died, aged 80. It was incredible that for the first time I saw her in a movie, yet she was amazed at the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually repressed Sarah comes out of the shell after a sting of alcohol in Havana, letting herself go with an adorable playful play "If I Were a Bell". Even though Simmons and Brando were not singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to reproach his voice, saying "maybe it does not sound so good, but at least you are." In spite of Goldwyn's trust, the pair is good to wear whole musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same childlike animation that Audrey Hepburn could have done, and Brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it does not matter that his singing voice is not right there.
