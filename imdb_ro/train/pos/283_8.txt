"Days" is a typical family drama with a small trap - you have to refer to the character's emotions in any way possible to really appreciate your show. [Possible Spoilers for Those Who Are Not Famous With The Show] The story, of course, for all who have watched the show, is the World of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He registers his days with his family and hopes to become one day a rich and famous writer because of his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a small brother. The first episode, which would seem a bit bad since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both sister and mother are pregnant. This is the first situation where the writer hits. Then father drops out of office at the law firm. The youngest son has a panic attack. The middle child is struggling with the sister's friend. This is a day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a little weird, but I like it. First I thought the camera was a ripoff, but then I got used to it and I started to like it. I liked silent conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate sensation of the show. I liked the low-budget style. I liked the act. I admire the story. Then, I feel a second season of Days. I gradually became a fan of her as the 6 episode episode on ABC came to an end. It's a very good show and it's nothing like OC. The two have nothing in common. So, I hope fans will stop comparing them. And if you can refer to either Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will love this show. A lot.
