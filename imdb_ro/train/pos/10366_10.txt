A "10." Unqualified The level of writing and acting in this Australian film reminds of the best of the "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill fits the Streep line for the line and takes to take - is one of the best showcases still of his talented talent actor and is at its best sexy and gorgeous despite the intensity of his role. This addictive film is a treat for any fan of the movie who loves a drama in the theater room, portrayed in the most humane but unsentimental terms. The film - which has won several top awards in Australia - boasts not only a superlative cast and a director, but also an authentic Australian authentic location. It turns out that people are the same in the world. And after all these years, people were still delighted to repeat the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate a baby!" Including that "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld".
