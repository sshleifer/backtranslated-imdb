"Stories of the Century" was a series of half hour hours and appeared in the first phase of the syndication during the '54 -'55 television season. It was also the first Western television series to win an Emmy Award. In the role of veteran veteran Jim Davis, Jim Davis, track detective Matt Clark, the series set Clark and his railroad detective partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" in the second half) scams of different periods, ranging from the mid-1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to follow and quite realistic, especially due to the charm enjoyed by Jim Davis in the lead role. It seemed like a current Western character. Another note. When Matt Clark arrived in the city after a long walk, he looked like he was on a long walk with horses because it would be covered with dust.
