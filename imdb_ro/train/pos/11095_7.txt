I have always liked this film John Frankenheimer. A good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why he was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His dazed direction and attention to small details make the difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can do a case that made the last good movie Roy Scheider did. I have always said that Robert Trebor only gave extraordinary performance. Clarence Williams III has received all the publicity with his frightening performances and he is great, but I really thought Trebor went out. Frankenheimer can not be as proud of this movie as the others, but it's an effective thriller, full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors that appear in slower parts. What can you say about a movie where Ann Margaret was shot and raped? A guilty pleasure to say at least. Vanity has a real and unpleasant role, and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploitable thriller that should not be forgotten.
