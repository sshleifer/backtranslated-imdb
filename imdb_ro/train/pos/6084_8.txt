I was pleased with the distribution of renowned players. The story is one of raising a cause, even if you are in personal danger to this. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on the old-fashioned cop. Although similar plots have been repeatedly done, these guys are doing well. Bounce back and enjoy yourself. Dennehy is a master of taking a movie.
