I looked at Pufnstuf every weekend when I was 10 years old. It was right after Bay City Rollers. I saw her one day in Family Channel and recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things I loved in my childhood, the magic flute, the zoom sweeper, Witcheepoo's makeup. This performance is extremely low technology. The mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a creature stuffed with enigmatic eyes. But kids love this stuff. They would be a way of looking at a type of work a sock puppet rather than standing up to high-tech computer animation. There is a lightweight paper, but there are no adult themes such as sex or dying, and children accept Jimmy's schemes. The kids think she would be cared for to wear a bag of smoke and convince somebody that their house was in the fire and I liked how every time my daughter saw a stream of water in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead . Music is old, but you really get used to, and my daughter really loved her. She is singing "otherwise it's hard, another is alone" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and is still one of her favorites. I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the factory. I really hope they try to keep the old flavor and do not do something like animation characters, etc. I think a new generation would love Pufnstuf.
