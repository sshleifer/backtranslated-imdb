"Iphigenia" is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This master game is greatly adapted to the screen and brought to life through a wonderful distribution. Cacoyannis obtained the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing his efficiency and importance. A Greek star distribution helps it. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive like Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, which, although sometimes seems to be above, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek movie, nicely adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal in any scene. <br /> <br /> Rumors say the movie lost the best Oscar foreign film with only 1 vote !!!
