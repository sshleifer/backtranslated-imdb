"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast, exuberant, wonderful, funny comedy from Warners, which is sadly passing. It should be remembered if only to deliver the official theme song of Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood". The score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other stones, but including the charming "I'm Like a Fish of Water" and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight." The best musical number is "Let's be a lesson for you," in which Dick Powell and the company detail the misunderstandings of people who found themselves "behind the eight-ball", a fate that in turn suffers from burning slow by Edgar Kennedy End. The picture celebrates a glamor of Hollywood and penetrates it instantly, given that there are plenty of comic kilos of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and double studio managers. The award includes a lot of great personality comedians - Allyn Joslyn, a frightening press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's former manager, Fritz Feld, as restaurant owner Glenda Farrell as Vincent Galla, Edgar Kennedy machine manager, Mabel Todd, Mona's naked sister, and Hugh Herbert as her younger father. The "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second fragment in which Herbert appears black during a pseudo-gone With the Wind. It's a questionable taste, but it should not stop you from seeing the other delights of this film, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) As I think it's the only movie available on this incredible jazz combo. "Dark Eyes" takes too long and is too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel that is worth a long time and certainly a movie that should be considered for DVD release.
