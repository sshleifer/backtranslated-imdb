Is it a good idea to use live animals to display the shop window? <br /> <br /> No, and why ... <br /> <br /> In the "Hare Conditioned" sale of Bugs promotional aids are over and the store manager (Nelson) transfers it to a new department: taxidermy. Bugs object and fun begins. Using almost every store department (baby clothes, sports, shoes, suits, nightclubs - do not ask.), Bugs comes out on the top of every turn, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE". Even when caught in the limits of a lift, Bugs does all the best. Director Jones is at the top of his painting game as always, as Blanc (Bugs, natch) and Nelson manager - who sounds like a Gildersleeves radio station - just ask your parents.) And a counseling word: when confronted with a fuzzy woman who wants to try bathing slippers, she always checks her ears. Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument yet for animal labor laws.
