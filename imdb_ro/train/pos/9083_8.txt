I liked this movie and I had a very low wait because of all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious about what it was about, because some posts were so upset about this movie and the Koreans. Oh and it's from Korea that took me some favorite movies. I liked the host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my fantastic SF-SF / FANTASY movies have a sense of taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. > It was not confusing that everyone said monsters also look good and wonderful battles. There are some holes in the story, but it does not really matter. I have something like this, and I stopped asking myself why a long time ago when I saw summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation thing was different and I thought the main characters were dressed suspiciously like Korean actors in other performances. Ethan's hair (Behr) seemed so Asian. Yes, it might be better and I hope that in the future Korea, with its unusual feeling of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, diversity from the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of host wars and Dragon in the future?
