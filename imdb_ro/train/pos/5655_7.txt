I watched this show based on the fact that it was said that he reminds David Lynch of Twin Peaks - a show I adore. The show begins to introduce our main characters and rather unusual the pilot episode is for me the best batch, extremely dramatic and really pulls out the bad side of the show ready to progress in the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little revealed by the show - probably not by my own fault because it was canceled after a single season, it seemed to show a lot of potential and deserves a lot better treatment than it did. The actor is great and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) in him that I have ever seen well developed in a short time. There is strange strange effect for the first 5 or 10 shows that are a little too dramatic, but this is rectified as the season progresses. Well it's worth a watch, certainly something unusual!
