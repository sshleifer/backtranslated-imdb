Sequels hard to live up to the original. This is certainly true in this case. However, if you are a great fan of the original than surely provide this watch. Although the camera is missing, the character of Brian Krause is annoying and the plot is clickable, it is more fun than the first one and that seems fun to me. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie waiting for the same performance as in the first movie. Pretty honest is something different. Rather than staying in scenario scenes in the cabin, Stanley goes to Hollywood, trying to straighten his dream project, The Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a different feeling, but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. I give him 6 out of 10.
