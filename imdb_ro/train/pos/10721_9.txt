This is one of the most culpable films of pleasure ever! I'm ashamed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I'm still glad to watch her make her space suit "super cool" with a "bitchin" belt and stick on the stones on her face. But anyway, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that is relevant to your interest. I know the beginning draws, especially if you know what's going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nervous segments of injury in a family movie. I will not rise in front of millions of people and news to love this movie, in fact, renting is quite embarrassing, but I will admit here that the Internet will hide behind. <br /> <br />
