I will begin by saying that this is undoubtedly worth almost everybody! The fact is, it was not what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was Cockney's fish and a good liner "Do not you like dags?" etc., but this is much more mature than its previous works. I would agree that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we only have to see them and listen more, this film needs all the attention! Look at the cool and dazzling look of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the shows and I think we all will better understand the whole movie. Yes that has influences of modern classics (fighting club, pulp fiction, etc) but it is originally entirely in both directions and pacing, with a second music score at none. I feel that if everyone had watched this movie over and over, they would understand much more and maybe appreciate it for the beautiful piece of modern cinema that is, and I hope Ritchie goes on in this quack because I prefer this much for mockney "masterpieces".
