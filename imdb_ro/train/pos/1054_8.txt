If you want action without mind, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic vision of Seattle, then this is the show for you! The Angel Angel concept is not new (in fact, there is controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but spend the whole hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish. Jessica Alba smokes and Max's friends (the original Cindy, Kendra) are just hot. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max have to be a little bit better (the slang of forced sounds and sounds like someone living in the suburbs is writing). /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure, full of what an action fan might want, but if you're looking for a hit, award-winning drama, watch The West Wing.
