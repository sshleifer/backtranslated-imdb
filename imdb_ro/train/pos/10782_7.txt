Michael Stearns interprets Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. He has no problem ogling dancers freely, but when women start to have sex with men then he loses. He thinks that when women actually have sex when they lose no sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks through Hollywood Hills pursuing couples making love out of the distance, finally shooting dead men with a high power shotgun with a scope. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the apparent existence of this film is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. The "story" comes as more of a later thinking. This is bound to make many a happy heterosexual man quite pleased that we are treated to plenty of prolonged nudity scenes (ladies here look sans clothes extremely well) and sex to serve as a great dose of titillation. Of course, seeing a fair deal of it through a UPS scope creepiness factor considerably and illustrates compulsion towards voyeurism. (Moreover, Mike looks at the eyes of couples in minutes before pulling the trigger.) This is highlighted by extremely invasive music if somewhat atmospheric on the soundtrack. the inclination for troublesome rubbish is bound to enjoy it to one degree or another. It even includes a lesbian event that confuses Mike and makes him unreliable * how to react. It's running at a very slow pace, but it's spinning with a very fun iron turn. It is a perverse and rarity twisted yarn that if nothing else will certainly keep some screen savers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
