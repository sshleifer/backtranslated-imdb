Well, I do not like the rap character, but I still found fear of a hilarious Black Hat. I'm sure I did not get some jokes inside, but some knew it and it was fun enough to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of the Spinal cock, so I have to check this out. It was derived from "This Is Spinal Tap," sometimes in flagrant fashion, but this film remained like an original, intelligent and fun satire. My personal favorite: "Back during the slaves, they did not have hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to take revenge. Now we have hats."
