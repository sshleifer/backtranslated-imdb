I think it's a great movie. because you can see how Diana's life is at home. she has received such aggression and wants to show that girls can also fight. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I have a box. It really impressed me. the only negative side I believe. It's the end. because it's good between Diana and Adrian. But you do not understand how it is at home. And I did not really like that you do not understand how Dad and her brother do. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'll look at it much more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you do not like the box, you will see much more than the box. I looked very much.
