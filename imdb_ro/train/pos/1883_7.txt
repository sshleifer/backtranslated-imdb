Excellent comedy with Dudley Moore, backed by Liza Minnelli and well-spoken John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man of a multimillionaire family who was close to getting 750 million dollars, provided he marries a lady (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually refused to meet Linda Marolla beautiful and beautiful (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not go, he enjoyed drinking and having fun with prostitutes. After some serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, though the latter knew his life would change in the near future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. Rich people are not usually satisfied with their way of life.
