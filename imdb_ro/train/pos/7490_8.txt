So far I have never seen this movie. His film was filmed on the sets of the old Dark House and Frankenstein and refers to a small Bavarian village where the alleged giant bats suck the villagers' blood. Honestly, it is a good film that has a spare atmosphere and a song that will not give up, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play a character called Brettschnieder, which is of interest to me because it was the name my grandmother's virgin. a carefully modular film that has suspense and enmity a lining that builds slowly for its short-lived time, wandering only when about ten minutes before its end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up. From that moment until the end of it is a direct way to the end, with very little fun that preceded it. Leonard Maltin and IMDb lists a 71-minute running time and warn of shorter fingerprints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are since a source that I trust more says the time of operation is 67 minutes (Overlook Film Encyclopedia) I do not know about it I know it's mad, which are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably lower if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not count so much from five minutes or so, and I very much doubt it will make or break the movie. What ever time, if you like old movies, makes it by all means to watch this movie, a dark and stormy night movie.
