Driving Jim Belushi, a modern, chic version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that allows Belush to see what life would have been if he had "done great." Jim is the best with a good story and a support distribution; seems to be a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. He is not an Oscar contestant, but a pleasant fun.
