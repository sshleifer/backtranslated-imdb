This is a powerful film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and simple. Indeed, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man, whose honor comes in conflict with the more educated and richer men of the period. Poor vs. Rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told story without much of the hollywood glitter sprinkling on the screen. Extra points just because you can almost smell people on the screen. :)
