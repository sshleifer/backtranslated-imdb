I saw her and I love Melissa playing her role well. In fact, it was credible. My brother in law saw it with my sister and when I told my sister I forgot that it was based on a true story (I saw it a few years ago), he said just because in your life you think it's true And both my sister and mine were as if it was so anyway I was wondering if someone knew what murder it was or how it was who it really was involved was because I want to know what, I prove that. I like movies in my lifetime, especially those that are real, or just those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I do not remember where he'd appreciated any help.
