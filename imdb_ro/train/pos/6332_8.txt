This movie is good for television. I like it because I'm a big fan of disaster films, even if it's a family movie. The film's accuracy in the book is half and a half. They got the names of characters, but there was no storm in the book, the scene of the cars involving the Hatch family running away from the tornado was not in the book involved Dan Hatch and his riding friend with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety. and in the book Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. All I can think of. Overall, this was a good movie, even if it could have been a bit more accurate about the book. Did you know that the book is based on a true story about a series of tornadoes that devastated a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
