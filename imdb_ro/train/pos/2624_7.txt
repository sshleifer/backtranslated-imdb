In this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the movie when they are not presented - which is much! This film goes just before Simba and (presumbably) immediately after Kiara's birth. <br /> <br /> Quite true for the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in Other Places)" is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising movie (or the sequel if that's what you want to call him). A pack of surprises and hilarious awaits you! While Timon and Pumbaa watch a motion picture movie, Timon and Pumbaa have an argument as to which "The Lion King" they will start looking at, as Timon wants to go to the side when he and Pumbaa come and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise to watch the movie of their own story, what awaits ... Start with Timon's home ... <br /> <br /> For someone with a good sense of humor who liked the first movies almost any age, enjoy the "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
