An end of an era was released here in the United States in the spring of 2002 with The Rookie, a live action Disney movie that seemed to be "the best for the last !!!!!" It happened right here in Texas! In fact, the story began in western Texas, as it results from a zone code found on a sign there. It was a high school coach who was so convinced by his high-grade baseball team that he decided to go professional !!!!! What I liked about this movie: It was very beautiful! !! It was a very good sporting movie, the "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. He also took filming in Texas, somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso to Metroplex (where they live). I can say because I recognize that golf course (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington", now it is the "Ameriquest field")! It was nice to see Disney "Golden Age" end here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Disney's Golden Age <br /> <br /> Years 1920-Spring 2002 <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and ended with baseball. " (sighs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
