This is the last episode I deserved. At the end of the last season, things remained in a state of mind "life goes on," which was not difficult to conclude that this realistic series deserves. While it was not a happy show, this series has always been one that made you believe (a rare thing on TV), and that's no exception. "Death is justified by reasoning?" "Are morals reflected by society or society is the modeling of the morals chosen by the few in power?" "What is a just death and can it exist?" All these questions are presented by the writers of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Actor good, excellent writing, awesome camera, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw the series and missed this when it ran first, then put a copy on a copy. If you never followed the series when it ran, then it will rise alone, but it may be hard to try to keep up with who all the characters are and what they allude to in their varied past. For those of us who have been spectators in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying view.
