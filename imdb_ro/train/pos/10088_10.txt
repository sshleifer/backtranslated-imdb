Elephant Walk (1954) With Peter Finch, eldest of the manor, in a God-forsaken plantation, where there is always the danger of mad elephants or madmen sitting in the midnight sun and berserk. Well, finally, after the outbreak of tifoid or cholera, of course, many strokes happen. Taylor replaced a Vivien Leigh who suffers from this disease in a stroller / adventure. When the elephants get stuck with the house and catch Liz on the big ladder, I still suffer in the goose. Thanks to Dana Andrews is about to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. And in colors!
