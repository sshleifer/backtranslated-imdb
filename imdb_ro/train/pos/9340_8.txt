** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually featured in Comedy, but in "Reign", he offers a profound performance on the move. While there are people who have shown Courage starring on September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widow who is alone and "lost in his own world." Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets the old colleague of the College (Sandler) and wants to catch the "old days." See, as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman) she also becomes emotional and withdraws in stressful situations. People's music seems to be comfort and a "psychological" cage to support it. Johnson, in Fineman, is looking for some pleasure and ease in his Family. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied with his work. In the same case, He also wishes to make sure that his friend does not fall into the "social cracks". I came out of this movie with a different and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families.
