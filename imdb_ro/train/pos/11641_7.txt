I just caught an episode about Brad, the cocaine addict, who turned into a drug-addicted life on the street after his bike racing career just hit the shocks as quickly. I have to say that the story of his cycling career was unimaginable rather than drug addiction. Here's this young guy who wins left and right bike races and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arrival insults Lance Armstrong, one of the biggest athletes who has has ever lived and is generally for everyone in general. Obviously, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show relates to his struggle with addiction and how he resumed his life, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him first and foremost to make his act like such a bottom? > In any case, I was confused about how the show was put together, because Brad looks at the height of her addiction. We see images from him manipulating pan-manipulation and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking cocaine crack. We did not even know it was legal to show, but why would a camera crew follow to follow and film it? Do this in the hope that this guy will turn his life around and give them some stuff for a good TV episode? In any case, it is a luminous show because it shows the effects of the various dependencies and the total control they can take on people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to look at because you really know how bad your families and friends suffer in the face of indifference of addiction, though I must admit that in the end everything seems a little too clean. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happy feeling ever after the end and I have a feeling that it is a a very unusual event in real life. But yet, is it a show about people trying to help other people and you can not complain too much about something like that?
