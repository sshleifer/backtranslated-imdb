Extremely memorable, intelligent and suspense film from one of the real geniuses of the French film, Henri Verneuil, capable of making headaches. The plot is an exact parallel to the JFK assassination, and it's unfolded in a fictional country. The film, visual and plotting, is extremely sharp. From a meticulous precision, follows Henry Volnay, the Prosecutor who is concerned about discovering the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, not least for the cool and analytical precision of his commentary on an interior work of the so-called modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are entirely credible, and Verneuil did not leave anything to chance in his tight plot. On another level, this relatively little-known film had only a 15-year-old start on Oliver Stone, who was rated "JFK," a film in many areas, at least not credible ... < <br /> It's a masterpiece, any cinema lover should see it, preferably in the original French version of the subs.
