Here's a strange thing: a modern film about a serial killer who does not have battle scenes, no one has seen dying, no cars, no strong noises ... and it's happening in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrible. The rest of the story is detective work and how much bureaucracy had to pass the poor detective to solve the crime. This is a very sleepy film, and "somber" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea) as well. However, the story is not depressing and is very interesting all the time. Rea is remarkable as the determined detective, watched. Jeffrey DeMunn is even scary as a killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this movie that has a warmth. Once again, the story is scattered with liberal agendas, here and there, without one, but two references to bias toward homosexuals, the full validity of secular psychology, police and government officials being deceptive / brutal / bigotari, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is a smart and refreshing film of murder. This is a somewhat unique movie, which probably is not well known, but is well liked by those who have seen it. Because it's based on a real story of this murderer, it's so cool. Do not just do this because you have nothing to do with it.
