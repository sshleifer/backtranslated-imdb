This movie is a wonderful simplistic work. Pleasant from beginning to end is both sad and uplifting at the same time. Miranda Otto's performances (oh, as it deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls are understood. The things to support the workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful parts in themselves, just like Alice's lover, whom I can only help him feel a little bad. There is a certain scene I can always look at (and I have!). It is a shame that movies like these do not get recognized, and therefore bring them more into the public eye to enjoy more people. I cried, laughed and sigh. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
