I checked this as an impulse when I sailed through the movie store and could not have been more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it a lot. It's not the typical story with a love story and tears, but it certainly touches a nerve in the twist. It is an end in which, though unexpectedly and tragically, the overall effect of the film is not affected by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this movie, her debut, and it's worth looking! I did not recognize many of the actors who support them, but they all play well their important support roles. "Man on the Moon" is such a credible story about a teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can refer to everything - from Witherspoon's words, to her subtle looks and to her so subtle emotions (angry as a typical teenage girl). While she plays a confused character about love, she does not meet so bad and immature, who has been much appreciated considering many of today's films.
