Try to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, indeed, is the perfect B adventure of all time. Actually, it's a funny, fun-filled adventure that, even with its flaws, surprises you. It must have been the greatest movie ever for those who did it. Even though it was made in the 1990s, it does not have a modern sensation. It has more the same feeling as an old film Errol Flynn. The great adventure film is again the biggest thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as with old movies. This, on the other hand, has only the real feeling. You just can not hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really like the soundtrack. Hell, I want the theatrical song.
