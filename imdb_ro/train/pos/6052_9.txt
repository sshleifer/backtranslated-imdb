Highly recommended! A well-written, funny movie that will attract everyone there with a sense of humor !!! Let's go, it's good to see an independent British movie more than just take into account the big studio set! It's certainly worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this movie that I'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to. You will laugh aloud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I was particularly pleased with the Orb version of Jimmy Cliff's Vietnam and the Freebird Tower of London. <br /> <br /> Continue to let go ............ you will not be disappointed.
