A giornata particolare is a film that has made a brilliant use of enclosed spaces. In these empty, empty spaces, the audience sees emotional turmoil and the fiery outburst of Ettore Scola's two main characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated people who decide to come together for a few short moments of their lives. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take part with characters close to them. All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character. women would certainly complain about their hearts to the existential situation of Marcello Mastroianni. Disgusting sexuality is also one of the key issues of this sleepy, motionless film. Most characters are struggling with issues related to their own sexuality. A giornata particolare can not be called pro gay, although it was beautifully described that a homosexual chap mixes well with women. This is a film for which the Italian director Ettore Scola has created a fairly good mixture of facts and fiction. His point is to show how Hitler's arrival has changed the destinies of ordinary Italian people. A word about the courageous personality was magnificently played by the great Marcello Mastroianni. he does not praise mercy. He happily accepts his fate and prepares to face the worst of his short but significant lives. A true masterpiece of cinema!
