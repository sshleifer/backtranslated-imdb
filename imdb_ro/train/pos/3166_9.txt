This show has come so far. At first, EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez were new actors and actresses, fresh faces and just show what they did. They stayed with the show and it was a success. It's one of the best performances ever made and probably the most amusing sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see that it is over, but if this show ends, I hope God finishes the series with one of the biggest bangs he ever had the final of the season. I do not care if the whole season sucks because it saves all the fuel for the last episode. Go down, tie up, put your last shot. The show deserves, fans deserve, if they go, to know that everyone will end up like Friends and let the end be huge. I say Donna and Eric are married, say that Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, say something interesting happened between Fez and Jackie, because Fez has tried so much, but of course he will not work for he. FOLLOW THE BIG TIMES SERIES SERIES! <br /> <br /> That presentation of the '70s will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I want to be friends like your friends. You are the best! <br /> <br />
