This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Perhaps it is Corin Nemec's innocence and his insistence on Cheryl Pollak's boldness, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. Also, some characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in and on oneself. Finally, the story is one that always draws my hearts, and the last scene is so sweet. Generally, I like this movie; is perfect for a night of gooey, sentimental girls.
