If you went to this movie to see a huge prize academy ... oh well ... but if you wanted to see a funny old-fashioned adaptation, you'll love it. Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great, some parts added to Grinch's history have made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat ... But, although there were some comments about ADULT and added split, this is going to be a show of children or family. Try not to lose sight of that ... if you really want to enjoy the movie ... and as to the comments on Ron Howard, try to straighten a major cinematographic image and see how you do ... it's not easy so how does ...
