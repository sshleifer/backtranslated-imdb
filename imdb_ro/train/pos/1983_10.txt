I saw this recently on a cable channel. The film is great; is one of the few musicals I've seen that does not move away from light and darkness. It presents some of the splendor of age together with a lot of swamp. Some of the dance sequences of the songs are unfolding so much, I did not know where to look. One day I'll go and see this on the big screen just to see what's going on. But what really raises this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a complete and threatening man, but there are other, inner demons. It gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if the character of Sykes was at the edge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's film, Bill Sykes, from the 1948 film, and I thought it was just a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my living room.
