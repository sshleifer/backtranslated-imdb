The Blood Castle is a good example of high quality work in the horror genre that was revealed in Italy in the 1960s. The film has all the right elements - the old dark house, the atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes the most of a movie worth seeing. The story is about a haunted castle. People visited, but none returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and he can return to earn his fortune. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night every year when the dead return to regain their death. The only defect I see in the movie is the running time. He almost feels padded. There is a large part of the first act in which nothing happens. Our hero stops in the dark, finding nothing interesting. But once he found something, the movie gets up and gets pretty good. Blood Castle is a definite necessity for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
