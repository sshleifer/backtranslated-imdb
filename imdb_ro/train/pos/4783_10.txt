"The Straight Story" is a really beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides a lawnmower all over the country to visit his brother alienated and killed. But that's just the basic synapsis ... this movie is about much more than that. This was Richard Farnworth's last role before he died, and he will surely be one he will remember. He's a stubborn old man, not like the old men you probably know you and me. <br /> <br /> "The Right Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It will come down and touch some of you, at least if you have a heart, it will do it.
