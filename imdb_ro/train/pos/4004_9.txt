"Mother" is that extraordinary piece of shooting - she thinks, does not shoot you - and finally lets you think. Very much about the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (which I knew only briefly of her appearances in some projects led by Victoria Wood and believing a fine comedy) is really great here. She is not a stereotypical widow who was perfect in marriage and maternity. And not all that brave and adventurous in the beginning. He plays his character only with the right note that sounds real (fine, he did). Strong distribution. Great script. The renaissance of European cinema indeed;
