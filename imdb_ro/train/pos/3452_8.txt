I thought it was a pretty good film and it should have been released first in theaters. It would not have been a big blockbuster, but it would have done some pretty good money. The film has suspense and makes you wonder how much it's happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering it was his first film, he did a good job. This is a movie that's good to pick up and watch when you do not know exactly what you want to rent that night. It should work pretty well. The cast was great. So I recommend that everyone checks this movie!
