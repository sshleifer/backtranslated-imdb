Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome rider who gets to a roadside bar. He meets his young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), the owners of the bar. She occupies her mechanical skills by feeding and lodging and has an affair with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, doing a car accident. Their relationship is affected by the sense of guilt and police investigation. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. Luchino Visconti's noir and neo-realist movie is remarkable. This is the first time I see this version of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'. I liked the 1946 version of Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in cinema history, but this is certainly the best. My vote is ten.
