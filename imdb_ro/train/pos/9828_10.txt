I will be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a great zombie blow that is packed with action, original ideas, good action, but it's also full of bad zombie effects. Part IV, entitled "After Death," is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror movies fans like this should check out Master of Puppet, Live Pie, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon movies Pictures.
