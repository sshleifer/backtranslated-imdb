Antonio Margheriti's "Danza Macabra" / "The Castle of Blood" is a breathtaking, atmospheric cooler that manages on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a gorgeous gothic vibrational vibration. Alan Foster is an English journalist who is following an interview with American horror star Edgar Allan Poe. He bet he can not spend a night in Poe's friend Thomas Blackwood's abandoned mansion. By accepting the bet, Foster is locked in the mansion and horror begins! The film is extremely atmospheric and was scared by the hell out of me. The crypt is really stunning and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as a sinister speculator Elisabeth Blackwood. "The Blood Castle" is easily one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 60's. A masterpiece!
