POSSIBLE SPOILER - in a way "how to alienate friends ...." is "missed learn to adapt, become successful and finds that something else matters more" kind of story, located in celebrity business. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy offers some good moments. Though I think the end is wrong. It felt too fast and too steep, as if something was missing. Besides, I would say that the film is not capable of maintaining a high level. Besides, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses, which have sometimes controversial contradictory qualities. Until now, I have not seen Pegg anymore. Still, he is a very unique type, though on the screen sometimes it may seem a little more tiring than necessary. Fox turned out to be able to play a hot starlet with his head in the clouds. I do not know if it was hard to do, but her performance was warmer and better than during the "Transformers" (well ... probably not a tough game). Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like (like me) or find him annoying. On the other hand, you'll see Anderson who has proven his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (which is good, but maybe he could have acted a bit stronger). Everyone fits perfectly with their character. Conclusion: I think it's a beautiful comedy, with some less fun and more fun, a sweet piece, but a too quick finish.
