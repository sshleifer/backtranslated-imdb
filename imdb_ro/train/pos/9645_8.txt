"Presque rien" is a story of two young boys who fall in love during their seaside summer holidays. I do not mean the plot, because it's not the most important thing about this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinema. The visual aspect of "Presque rien" is so stunning that it deserves the highest note. It leaves you enchanted by its beauty. As for the plot, it is shown in an uneven, rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology or answers to all the questions the film brings. But this makes Presque rien even more exciting. I recommend this movie to all people for whom the artistic part of the films is very important and will not be disappointed.
