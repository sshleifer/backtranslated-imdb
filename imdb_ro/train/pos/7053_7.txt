You're not wrong "War Inc." for a sharply sharp satire or for a smart joke comedy inside news fans. Is not. This is a comedy with old-fashioned screws, with ridiculous coincidence plot shuffling, stock characters (deep in funny performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. You see, the political points of cinemas are things that almost all of the country already knows are true. Yes, we understand that corporations that take advantage of the war are corrupt, some rogue pigs, the political leaders responsible for it are even more devious buffs, and American imperialism has never been more dazzled and touched than now - but nothing of this is the point. Here, all this noise is the setting that they hunt - sometimes in genius ways - as a backdrop for silly stupidity, that John Cusack's character (the heart man) tries to change his life with the help of a journalist who does not, (Tomei) and the young middle-aged couple who wants to withdraw their marriage (Duff). "Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with almost enthusiastic quality." Ben Kingsley seemed to me to be lost As a simple CIA chief, this is all and it works. It's a simple fun, but if you can not see the reality in a way and you think the war is going well and everyone involved does a good job and there is no corruption, people in the Middle East want our Western culture to replace them, you might not find it as funny. For all of you, it was a light comedy with a political edge.
