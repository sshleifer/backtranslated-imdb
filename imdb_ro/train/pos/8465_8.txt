Booth puts a new twist in the typical J-horror movie. This film puts you in the footsteps of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. The story is about the perception of people who work, live and love our protagonist and how they perceive the people who surround him in an old radio station radio. The story of the skin turns the characters of the main character into a flash-backs as the movie moves, and from it I find that things are not always as it seems. The film was mostly in a studio of a very bad radio station where the main character was forced to broadcast the show due to the fact that the radio was being relocated. From this limited space this film shines and makes you feel very claustrofob and very paranoid. Over time, our protagonist can not determine the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by his ghost or a conspiracy from his colleagues or everything was in his mind. What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make you as paranoid as the protagonist. This film is a very smart film, it resists pretty short 76 minutes.
