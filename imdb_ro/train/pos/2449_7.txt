when I saw advertisements for that, I thought, "NICK NICK NITE!" because he's dealing with the "fresh prince" slots. well, I still love the fresh prince. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I like how it's not stereotyped. carmen is a pretty good character, it's very fun to see how bad and killing can sometimes be. I feel bad for the guy who plays max, looks much younger than he is actually! but max is a fun character and acted well. and yes, angie is a bit stereotypical, but it has funny moments. ha ha George has a big head! but it can be very good. funny show! it should definitely be more than home improvement.
