If the creators of this film were trying to put reality into the plot, it would have been just a waste of time, money, and creative effort. Fortunately, by casting all the claims of reality to the wind, they created a comic miracle. Who could pass a movie in which a foreign pilot spends the entire film acting as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers' shirt. Do not reject this movie as garbage.
