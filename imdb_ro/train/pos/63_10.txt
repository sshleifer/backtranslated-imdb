This movie is so incomprehensible that it's not even funny. If you think about seeing this for shooting ... you're clear. This refers to the effects and trauma survivors have to endure. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all do ... WHY? A fantastic action from the two top ladies, as we see how those we ignore are affected by the same things we are affected with. Yes, tongue is hard sometimes, but it fits well with the characters. There are some remaining or unresponsive freeheads, but all the movies have these. Major issues are addressed, and this film makes a major statement about how we all adults feel after such major incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
