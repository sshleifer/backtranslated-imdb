Clue number one - read the title as "Crazy dog's time", or maybe dogs. This is quite good overall (look at the distribution and rent it - you know you are already curious) and the director for the first time Bishop gives them the chance, spending their time, letting the characters interact and chew the landscape - not with enthusiasm - for the return of the "great boss" and for any resulting revenge. For some of us, the accent sees Christopher Jones after his self-imposed exile in the movies; he remains a dominant presence in the film. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the "Wild in the Streets" meeting party!
