This is the best movie ever made to address the AIDS issue. It's a documentary about two men who live and die of this disease. The film is beautiful, full of heart, fun and incredible to move. Above all, it is a true love story. Make sure you have some hankies ready before watching this movie --- you will need them. Extraordinary.
