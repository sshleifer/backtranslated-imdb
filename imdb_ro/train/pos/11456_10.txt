Andy Goldsworthy is a first-order Taoist master who expresses the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change are the things they are working on fundamentally. I bought her first book a few years ago and my family marveled at her several times. So it was a treat to get to know your personal artist through this movie, it is as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which is expressed in its occasional incapacity, we say in words at all. It's like most kids playing alone in the big outdoors (if they do), creating things from sticks and sand, mud and snow before they overdo it. Mr. Goldsworthy has received the gift and mission to expand this type of game to create profound insights of nature and to open his often tired eyes to him in brilliant new ways. And always with the greatest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk.
