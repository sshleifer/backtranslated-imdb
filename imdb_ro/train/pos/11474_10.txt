This movie is one for ages. First of all, I have to say that after seeing it once, it has become one of my favorite films. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has made a real piece of art. If 99.9% of the movies are currently entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us a reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this has happened. The media rotates and rotates, but Ben Coccio throws a school kick right in front, able to go where no other form of media has ever passed before, in the minds and hearts of two young people who intend to - and kill classmates. While it is certainly graphic and frightening, how could it not be? The gloves are removed, the lies and the sugar coating of our mass masters are left aside and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just a lost screw like everyone likes to think, not, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, they're more humane, it shows that these guys are new and new. The society left them behind, and the consequences are terrible and real. Respect and love your fellows. A lesson that we should all learn, thank you very much for this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film career.
