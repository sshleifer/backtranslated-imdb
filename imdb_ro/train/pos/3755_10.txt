I remember this movie many years ago. Of course, the best movie on this theme in my experience. The fact that I remember so much from the film after so long testifies to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performance due to the language barrier. But they were still very strong. This topic continues to fascinate us over the years. And it was treated most effectively here, with the correct proportion of historical perspectives and skepticism. I'd like to be on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there an art film archive that has a copy of it?
