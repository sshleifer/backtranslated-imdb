When I wanted through the TV Guide and came across "Twisted Desire" in the movie section, I read the description. Three words caught my eyes "Melissa Joan Hart" ... It seems to me that her role in "Sabrina: The Witch of the Teenager" is absolutely vague, I hate those programs, so I thought it would be an old boring, love story with her ... Little knew. Eventually it started on TV, I had my bucket ready in case I got to crack over cheese or soppiness, you know what I mean. At first, you think she's just a beautiful, ordinary girl who's in love, but she has bad parents. When you learn that she has manipulated her boyfriend in killing her parents so that she can be with her true love, you are like "Whoa". You just do not expect this kind of role for that actress. She played her very well in my opinion, I never expected to be able to act like such a bitch, and herself, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I will certainly watch it again and recommend it to others.
