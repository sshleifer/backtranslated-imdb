I have overcome this (Act-I) through pure and bad luck and this has been more than a decade ago. This was not exactly what the label on the box mentioned. He was amazed. It intimidated me. It shocked me. I finally forgot and almost a decade later, I thought about it again. Then he went and bought both papers. They were even better than I experienced in the beginning. My only complaint is that, while tank police continue to continue and around war crimes, tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as if they really have a hard time with criminals . This is never shown, or is simply a lie, because it seems to be relieved most of the time. If that bit of being in a state of war really was propaganda, it certainly was not demonstrated as such. I do not think the original Japanese could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this. But as for the story, there were certainly some correct explanations lost in translation, but it could be excused.
