A measure of the greatness of a movie is, "If the tv came now, do you want to sit there and look again?" My response to the Grand Canyon is as powerful as for almost any movie I've seen There are so many powerful moments, a smart and moving story of incredible performance. It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so aggressive in the early nineties. also dramatically asserts the ability of individuals to love, think, and care. In a way, the film was of the time, partly as society as a balloon to explode, because the country is in a recession and thus devoid of the film is also immortal, I think it could rise upright against any film ever made and is the most forgotten movie in all time.
