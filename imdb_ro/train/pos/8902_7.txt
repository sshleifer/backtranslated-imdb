I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would go on to become a pictogram and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive," in the same year this movie came out, or be in The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would have done it. But he did, and we are richer for her. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a classic camp. Horror mode was meant to be for drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the last lines of the movie were: <br /> <br /> Lt. Dave: At least we stopped. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They would not have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic region would be defrosting. The blob will be back soon.
