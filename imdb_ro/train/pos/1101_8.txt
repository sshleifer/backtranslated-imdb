While prices have increased greatly, and some details have become data, any owner who is struggling with proprietary issues should receive many chicks from this film. I know I did. <br /> <br /> Blandings, a New York executive, decides to move his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a beautiful home there. He enters one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to trials to construction difficulties, because the cost and construction schedule continues to get out of control. I thought the funniest scenes are where Blandings hires an entrepreneur to dig a water well. It digs hundreds of meters, but never finds water. However, just a short distance, a few days later, the basement of its home floods! Cary Grant and Myrna Loy offer credible performances as the young Blandings overwhelmed with problems they have never imagined and Melvyn Douglas is even better than Blanding's lawyer and family friend. The only warning is that social attitudes have changed greatly since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a little no idea of ​​how many problems she causes and a black maid (horrors!). So do not watch this movie through the 2003 social goal, and you'll enjoy it more. <br /> <br />
