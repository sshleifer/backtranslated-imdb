George and Kim travel with their young son Miles in a distant New York cabin when their car hits a deer and floats in a ditch. But what seems to be a mere accident of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey in which the myth becomes reality and a spirit that eats meat, half an animal and a half man Wendigo, haunts a small town ... "Wendigo" de Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film, which often tends to be a dramatic family family. the characters are well developed and there are some moments of cooling the bones. Wendigo's subtle glimpses are treated effectively, and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story takes place entirely in Miles's head. , "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and will certainly not be the last one. Give this movie a chance if you do not mind seeing something unconventional.8 out of 10.
