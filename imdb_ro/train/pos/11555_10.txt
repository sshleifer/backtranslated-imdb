A simple comment ... What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie I can always watch. It is certainly one of the top ten comedies made. With a big cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau write a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his play. It is real for the perfect living situation. If you have a digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to give it what it is. It usually offers this movie ***, but it really deserves stars ****. If you really look at this movie, it can be said it will be as fun and fresh as it is a hundred years from now.
