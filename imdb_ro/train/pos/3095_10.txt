So what's the reason? Is there any vendetta against this AWESOME show or anybody involved in it? Why would he cancel the best show I've seen over the years? I am addicted. I saw this show at random in the autumn of last year and I immediately loved him and watched him every week. Then she left, and I tried to do Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot some time until I found the episodes on the ABC site. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on today's TV, it was refreshing to see something so rounded and developed like this. I'm following Boston Legal for my eccentric and comic fixation and my House to solve my intellectual mystery. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for "realism," and I love / hate the show, but it can not be more real than I do. You HAVE too much drama. Anything can go wrong, no. But for once there is a drama that is REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster who turned well, a girl running from the crowd, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really there and I mean each one of them. It does not seem enough to me. I only hope that ABC will take their heads off their bean counting head and will continue this show. Get respect because you have a quality drama there. This could be one of the best performances of all time. If anyone leaves it.
