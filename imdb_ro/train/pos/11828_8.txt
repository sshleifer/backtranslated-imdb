"Dick Tracy" is one of our family favorites - the actors are wonderful - the art direction is exceptional - the music is magical. It's not about killing a mockingbird - it's a fun experience. Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back to business" is energetic, "Sooner or later" is just fair "What You Can Lose" is haunted - even songs such as "Live Alone and Like It," adds to the story " > <br /> He must like Al Pacino's highly performing performances, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, and the criminals ... The list is too long. And, yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are wonderful. Writing with a smile a minute (every time we looked at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I think - it's gone!"?). However, one of the best known things about this movie is that everyone involved seems to have fun - and above all, this adds joy to the spectator. So, if you have not already done so, why do not you give "Dick Tracy" a chance - accept it for what it is - a comic book brought to life - and in a wonderful way!
