The endless limits of our inhumanity to our own guy never succeeds in killing me. This really stunning story of a horribly and largely unhealthy population of the population is convincing, well documented and angry. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behavior and this is something else in our long list of international depreciation. We suck. This is probably the first documentary of John Pilger I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason we gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this transgression and the awful collaboration of the US and British governments, that we, the spectators / citizens, are complicit in our own lack of action ... but does not make any suggestion on how to help. I do not know about the UK, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to take part in their government's actions. A gesture in the right direction could help the cause of these insulators.
