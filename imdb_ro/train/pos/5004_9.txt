but equally fun and alert! Love it or hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated plot or cliffanger. Think of it as in Seinfeld, but without the successive and repetitive performances of the villainous characters (well ... so far I have a feeling that I will develop my favorites as the season continues). "Creature Comfort" is not for those who are humorous - it's meant to enjoy the least effort from your brain. That's why this show embodies everything I need in a program when I get home from work in the evening: superficial conversation in the background with only the right amount of "cute" characters for me to enjoy when I finally look at my computer for to see what is missing. Funnier than most of today's sitcoms, calmer than one night at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and returns. I can not wait for the next one.
