I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard show. And I enjoyed this movie very much. I enjoyed myself much more than I did with other summer blockbuster. It's a funny audition of people against this movie with apologies such as "blade plot" and "it's far more cruel than the show." Whoever remembers cruel humor in the pilot episode? Daisy does the jests of incest, and Bo says that Luke probably has multiplied half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason why it was cleaned is that it has changed at the previous time. And the plot. It was the perfect Dukes plot. In fact, a remake is probably more true to the source than any TV show that migrated to the big screen. While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like their small screen versions, they do a good job and work very well together. I was not too keen on Burt Hogg from Burt. And I'd like lesser incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie, Roscoe is a little ... scary. And who did not have a smile on their face, while General Lee runs the streets of Atlanta and Hazzard's back roads? <br /> <br /> <br /> People, let yourself enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car tracking, it will not hurt you. It's just a great movie!
