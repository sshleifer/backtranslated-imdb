As summarized in a single line, two films left a remark when I left the theater. One was "News of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". One of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and do not think of anyone around you, do not ask what the end of the movie is and let the movie take you where it wants ... Out of the cinema it was kinda weird , as if you were sick and you did not think of anything. One of those movies you become one with the guy and you feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie. One thing is certain. The actors are wonderful, the sound track is great and everything in the movie is 9+. Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen and the movie that made the best and most shocking wake-up about my life and my purpose in this world.
