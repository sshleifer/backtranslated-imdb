Jiri Trnka made his last short animated accusative of totalitarianism, which caused problems in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the simple symbols, and its ornamental marks almost absent here, allowing the spectator to focus on the fabula. A man in his room devotes himself to ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders her to make a statue itself. The man refuses and is persecuted by the menacing hand. These days, if the impression of the reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that are trying to replace the real world, it's refreshing to watch a movie that makes its technique a part of pleasure.
