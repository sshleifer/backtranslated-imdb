I saw this movie a few weeks ago and since then I have stayed in my head. It's about two spirited characters in what is, unfortunately, a mediocre documentary. To get the true story of Beales, I had to go through all the DVD bonus materials and comments and search the web. Although Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) are hinting at the suggestion that this film is exploiting, this is exploitation in the true sense of the word. Very little effort is being made to explain the Beales or how they came to the condition they were in - Maysles's approach seems to be just starting the room and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even in the case of the re-launch of the Criterion, is weak and difficult to track. Although I appreciate this film being made somewhat early in the history of documentary film, it is ironic to compare it with Geraldo Rivera's superior series (!) On Sexual Abuse of Mentally Retarded Patients at Willowbrook State School in 1972, four years before being shot Gray Gardens. To paraphrase a magazine in New Yorker, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and a documentary was not one of them. Edith and Edie, the thing I thought while watching the movie was "where the hell is their family?" They were living in dangerous, unhealthy and unsafe conditions. How does it feel that Jackie O, married to one of the richest people on Earth (or Bouvier's wealthy family), could not allow Edith and Edie to be a decent house? Or at least hire a housekeeper or a half-time caretaker to get in and keep an eye on both? It is shameful and a lasting shame for the entire Bouvier family. Although this review might sound negative, I would strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who enjoys documenting. Perhaps one day someone will meet and make a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the 1970s the Beales wealth and damage and the entire sub-section of Hamptons.
