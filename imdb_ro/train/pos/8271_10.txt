One of the greatest hits in 1926, Brown at Harvard is an interesting comedy / drama, with reggae and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a major star. Haines is fully patented: a smart boring who takes nothing seriously until he is rejected by everyone and becomes a man / hero and wins a girl. No one has used this formula as Haines. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney along with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could move from comedy to tragedy with a change in face expression. He is a total joy in this film, as it was in Tell it to Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as my roommate sick, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and co-star Grady Sutton. This film is now remarkable for the homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for John Wayne's debut as Yale football player (but I have never seen him). Haines was a top box office star from this picture until 1932. It is a shame that he has been forgotten to a large extent and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
