As a great fan of the past three or four years, I really can not believe I just got to see "Purple Rain". The new special edition of 2 special anniversaries made me buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing him, but I was not prepared for how electric is actually. Prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing amazing - he really has the moves in this movie. I am very familiar with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all of its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie, it completely changes the perception of songs and lyrics - such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE FEAUTIFUL ONES WHEN GROWING and PURPLE RAIN itself. There is something hypnotizing about the scenes in which Prince and Revolution work. BABY I AM STAR and I would like to show how much talent and talented talent Prince has been full since the mid-20s (he is overflowing!), She blew me away. It really makes Michael Jackson look even dead on his spikes. The Prince has shown you how to win the face of your dreams - drive it to a lake, make it jump, then go - absolutely hilarious things in retrospect. Some of the scenes are very in the 1980's and unintentionally hilarious, but this adds the overall charm of the movie. Day Morris is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group The Time performing THE BIRD can see on Morris and Jerome Benton lights onstage style funk Minneapolis - I like their dance this little and as Benton gives his Morris is a mirror in the middle of time. I can not wait to see it again, just can not! Extrasurile are extraordinary - especially seeing a young president of Beverly Hills, Eddie Murphy, recognize that it is a group "prince".
