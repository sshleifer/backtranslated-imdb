I ran from beginning to end. Great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks created to make you jump, but to make you go "What F * ck saw?" All the other commentators briefly summed up what the film is, so I will not refresh what has already been said. I told others about this movie a few days after I saw it just because it still haunts me. I even had a bad dream after seeing him, and I'm a real fan of the horror that is not easily scared by stuttering like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill." What gave me bad dreams was the anxiety I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with those guys. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious led me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are what makes you a horror movement! The best part of this movie is that it's subtle. It's not about the bogeymen who have been tired of you, alien invasions or many gore. It's the other way around. Horror that you create in your mind. The irony of the four characters is that horror does not come from an external force that states it is power over them. Simply, men ask for the only thing I want and understand ... but not as they have imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but in the end they may wish they did not. Sometimes being stuck in a prison cell is the best place to be!
