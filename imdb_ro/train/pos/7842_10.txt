so in the middle of the season I was so caught up in school and the activities I did not realize the show was halted halfway, which is shit. I think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to finish at least the shootings so a season can be released on DVD later. maybe they will see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. I loved the show and waited for it every Thursday after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when I come back to try to see the show just to find that it's gone? I need to say that I'm not really happy with the fox right now. all the more so after discovering that NO has ever been filmed. If you want to work on a project, at least you end up seeing what's going on. a half-shot show is like a half-car is almost useless. the film ends and gives some fans of the show some peace.
