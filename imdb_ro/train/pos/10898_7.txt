This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was funny, funny and I like it spinning around the holiday season. I totally have the Christmas shop and listen to the holiday music. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will take the place of Christmas in my collection. It's going to be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving, to put me in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit mad, but I think he's just adding to the movie and why he's so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a christmas comedy with a breath of love. I liked. No, it's not Titanic, and it will not make your heart an anticipation, but it will bring a laugh or two. So, laugh and enjoy yourself :)
