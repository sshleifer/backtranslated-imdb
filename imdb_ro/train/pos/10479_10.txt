This is the movie that was actually my dentist recommended and I'm glad she did it! The mix of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a lost middle-aged widow who is trying to maintain his lifestyle was a hohot. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to really grow a pot (those plants under the bushes would NOT do it without the TLC they received) and it is a really hilarious and yet thrilling film. I laugh every time you concretize the vision of all the bar staff sitting in the lawn chairs with sunglasses on the counting of the lights! Maybe it's just my blood in Mendocino, but the British have definitely got it! 10/10
