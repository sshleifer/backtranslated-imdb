This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained large backgrounds and sets. 2) He showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside the technological one. 3) John Cusack's act was great. He portrayed very loudly. 4) He showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a situation torn by war. 5) He gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. I was also impressed by the act for the most part. Hilary's actor was, I found, the most instinctive. The morality and values ​​of all who are in a war-torn situation are likely to be grasped. The liberal journalist and conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are just as unpredictable. Wonderful things. PSP
