Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two foreigners on a European train. The two come from very different environments, they are American and French, after talking a little on the train. Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the following hours, the two are wandering in Vienna, taking everything that the city has to offer and becoming crazy about each other. But this new relationship will last the last sunrise. This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a declining genre. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before the Sunrise" never fades because of his small tower. In fact, it blooms because of the leaderships that make you love your characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Intelligent dialogue makes this a necessity for fans of romance.
