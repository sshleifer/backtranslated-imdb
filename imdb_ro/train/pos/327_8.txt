I have read a comment that has designated this film "garbage" and "a waste of time". I think this person took his political undies pulled a little too much. I rented the new Criterion DVD both yellow and blue. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> These films - though not too big - have become at least of historical interest for the so-called "political and social movement" of radical radicals of the late 60s. of their notorious reputation, I expected a real porn (there is not one). There is a front <nudity> (including the front man's nudity still automatic (<br /> <br />) > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I laughed aloud <br /> <br /> And the director's comment made it clear that there were a lot of parodies in the movie Sexual pornographic scenes <br /> <br /> The first such scene is very realistic, the lead couple is embarrassed, inept, funny and coveted in their first copulation scene. most complaints - falsified <br /> <br /> cunnilingus and fellatio. And the last is the end of an angry fight that is credible. The excerpts include an informative introduction to the film, an interview with the original American distributor and his lawyer, extracted from the US testimony and a "journalist" commentary by the director on some scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the movie that the "blue nose" would not leave alone and lead to the pivot of "prudent interest without redeeming social value" > Fortunately, it still stays. <br /> <br /> Those who have an interest in the strange history will find this a necessity.
