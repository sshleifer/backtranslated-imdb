Like the characters in this show, I was a teenager in the '70s. Manufacturers really attacked the entire zeitgeist, being a suburban teenager in the 1970s. The 70s, the cars, the home furniture, the food and the hand are very authentic in this show. The show has a very talented cast, which blends very well with the camera. I really like the sequences of the unique psychedelic movie. No other show makes room tricks like this. These latest movie sequences really contribute to the transmission of campy hipness, which has characterized the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a very funny sitcom. The only thing that bothers me about this show is too much addiction to cruel humor, to laugh. In this way, I think this show is trying to be too much like marriage to children. While married to children is a great sitcom in itself, it is sticky that the creators of the 1970s show, continue to try to mimic it. <br /> <br /> I recommend the Show of the 70s, mainly due to the nostalgia factor. But it could be a better event if writers rely more on spiritual dialogue than jokes, jokes and jokes.
