Made with style, picturesque and brilliant shot? Crosby's interpretation seems accurate, Hardwicke has the best role he ever has, while Bendix is ​​a trauma? this Yankee appeal is universal and irresistible. One of the main joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. As you can expect, Bing has a good voice. And although Hardwicke's solo was cut, we can still hear him singing in the heart as he dances cheerfully with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novel, Busy Doing Nothing. It is also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although enjoying an extended stage and a concert career as a singer, rarely had the chance to be heard in cinema. She has a beautiful voice that fits more than her glamorous look and looks very good in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. Director Tay Garnett takes full advantage of his generous budget, using all the resources at his command to present as efficiently as possible all the fabulous scenes. (Maybe the eclipse looks a little too controversial, but who's crying?) In short, as the trailer describes, a fun from the beginning to the end.
