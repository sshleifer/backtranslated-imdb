Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all men the ability to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, each person has that particular place he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this was the motto of some of the most eminent directors of our day, when they began to point out the eternal love for that particular place and to present situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, where our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take a stunning stroll through the Parisian arondisments, human feelings, desires and expectations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Paris's t'aime is about a lot of love - love for the partner, the child, the parent, for those who meant the world for us, but they are no longer around, the love that needs rekindling, love for the stranger on that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that simply is not meant to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? However, this film is not just about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily climbs and downs. And his most important quality is that it is not at all strange, but rather warm and hopeful. I give this film a 9, because the final section suggests how some of the stories might still develop, but not all, and that seems to me to be lacking, and by "further development" I do not refer to a specific reference to the future characters. As for anything else, I can only say - captivating. It makes you want to leave everything behind you, run to Paris and live those little romances alone.
