Well, it's been a long year and I got to review the final movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) was the second in the recent Manila Film Festival. As expected, he did not do that well at the box office because he was too artistic for those who love the world, especially as the MMFF is the season when a lot of families come out to watch movies. quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and as a director. Great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very effective as a star and was able to express a wide range of emotions needed for the film. Also starring was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. He did a great job portraying Bikay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope to see it in many other film projects in the future, perhaps to venture into other genres. I think the fact that this film was in its local dialect has really helped it. Some of the photos taken in the film were very good. The scenery was amazing, even though I feel that if a smaller effort is shown completely different. As for the story, I feel that the writers could have been more in the life of the smallest characters in the movie. I certainly will not be talking about the story of this movie.
