This is the only movie I saw the prince, but it does not matter. And I thought it was great at singing the boy being wrong. This is probably the best performance. Music is great. That's why he won the Oscar in 1984 for best music in a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under the belt. Although the curse gets in the way with the movie (make sure you do not have small children or in the room). There is not much to say without disclosing the plot. You should really get out and get this movie your collection is not complete unless you've got this movie in it. What else can I say, unless you go and get this movie now!
