I'm glad I saw the movie when he saw some of the director's other films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were great as the costumes and the bridge settings. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons was dealt with. I agree with some of the other comments about battle scenes. They were hard to follow sometimes. Finally, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what Japanese viewers thought about the film. It's a movie I'd like to see again. Some scenes such as those in which Benkai and the Prince were struggling at a "psychic" level were well done. <br /> <br /> He left the cinema thinking about what happened here. Intensive.
