This is an extremely powerful movie based on a true story that can be angered to look. I say this because how brutal it can be a hobby press for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple who deals with the killing of their child. Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this movie came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's say both were excellent, but the role was a bit harder for Streep because he had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned so well that I had trouble understanding the parts.) Without giving anything, all I can say is that this movie will wear you emotionally.
