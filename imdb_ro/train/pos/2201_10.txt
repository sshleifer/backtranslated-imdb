We just finished watching the disc 1 in a 4-disc collection (26 episodes) created with the UCLA Film & TV Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). Until now (except for the first episode), the image quality is pretty good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. "Mr. Peepers" is just as charming as when I first saw him (5 years old) and Wally Cox is really in this role. If you have a mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks over you, as opposed to hitting your head, you will have the opportunity to experience all the wonderful characters you have recalled since childhood. Although some of the gags are a bit of corny, most are ingenious and well-executed ... and even corny are fun. This is a series of television that lives up to my childhood memories.
