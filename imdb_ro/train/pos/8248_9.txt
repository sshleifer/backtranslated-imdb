When you see the cover of the DVD, you're convinced that it's a cheap B-class, a $ 1,000 movie in someone's yard. <br /> <br /> This is a good quality and very good material. It's a comedy and a smart one at that. It is also very moving in spots with a nice place of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (it looks great), the actors are known, the direction and the sets of the film are wonderful. It is amazing. Who would have thought? Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against the guy, is terrible, like Helen Robinson, Cleaver's wife in June; Billy Connolly is great as a hearty zombie "Fido"; Tim Blams Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a neighbor with the old zombie girlfriend "Tammy," and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker are the fathers (check) are also excellent K'Sun Ray as young "Timmy Robinson" should be overlooked. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story, it will sound so bad that few of you would look at it. You have to take the word of the people here who liked you and found a very pleasant surprise. You need a sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.
