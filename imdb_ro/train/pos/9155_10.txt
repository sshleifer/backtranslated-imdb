Who ever came up with the story is a sick person. We rented it for party parties and all six of us were scared, because we are together in an acting class together and we know a few actors in the classroom. Besides the fact that everyone was screaming the weird night, we had strange nightmares. I always thought about my God, if I got up to go to the bathroom to pee, I'd be stabbed in the middle of the wiping or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because I watched this terrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this movie, but do not we have any of the boys? You should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and cut off units. I would always look at this. Call him hard or soft or something stupid. Just give this movie a 9, because you made me FREAKS.
