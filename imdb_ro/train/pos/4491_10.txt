I like this movie "Spring and harvest wine". I was born in Leigh, a town about 11 km away from Bolton, and I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. My workplace was daily through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle, but then by car The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always scared but who will always help you if they can. Fred Dibnah was at the corner of Bromwich St. If you have not seen the movie when you were first released, then you can be forgiven for comparing it with a soap, such as Coronation St, well, I agree that it is a soap, but then it was called "Drama kitchen for the kitchen "! Watch this film for talented casting, which shortly after, became a family name from roles frequent on television, I see especially the pictures of the locality and the good sense of people being poor but happy!
