I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember that this movie is twice Braveheart's movie. It's just more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like he would imagine Rob Roy to look, disordered hair and beard with simple clothing. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic look on him, looks like a scotch and, more importantly, looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that shakes some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to be playing a legend that made him be described as a giant 6 foot 7, while Gibson is almost a little shorter. The story contains a little love story, a conspiracy and an unhealthy story. Call something like Braveheart? But instead of a movie that calls "freedom," freedom and nationalism, we get a movie that tells honesty, love and justice. This movie makes it a more exciting movie. Like the Gladiator. The distribution is fantastic, and Liam Nesson is a very powerful leader in this move. The story is wonderful with the way it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene in which Maria is raped and she leaves the burning house with a true Scottish power is followed by washing the semen from her thigh in an extreme panic. This is a heroine that Braveheart will never do. Generally, this is an amazing and almost flawless clock. Go and see!
