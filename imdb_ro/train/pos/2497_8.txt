Indeed: drug use, shooting depots, the "Matrix" escape escape bullet, a futuristic city with a mixture of Asian breeds and a lone vampire - also in the same movie - seems like a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And this is exactly what is "Baby Moon" and many more. While all these combined elements may sound like a perfect subject for a weekly B movie, "Moon Child" takes it out with just a few blows and expectations along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange feeling, certainly independent, jumping from scene to scene, not in a smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving a look to the life of the characters, making a real plot. But the film makes no excuses, turning the story into a friendship, love, trust and betrayal, covered with sugar in the above mentioned elements of a futuristic society that fights against gangsters and vampires. HYDE as the grim vampire "Kei" is excellent, deepening the character and balancing it on Gackt's extremely zealous act as "Sho," an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines like the revenge "Son" who becomes friend with an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their friends and family extended through different periods of their lives and how simple friendship can be so easily transformed into pain and treason. While the action sometimes is too unrealistic and special effects only appear to highlight, something that the film never does is not supposed to be the very popular Asian singers it presents. Superstars as actors have their flaws, as well as their characters. The film is seldom boring and ends where it should, after a little jump. "The Lunar Child" is quite pleasant, sometimes fun and very exciting: it is definitely worth the time!
