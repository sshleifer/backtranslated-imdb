For those who have commented on Patriot as being correct (who, in essence, have satanized English), it was interesting to see this movie. Of all this, it was the bloodiest war the Americans ever involved, being the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something that resembles historical precision from that part of the Atlantic that does not paint America as martyrs or as saviors. However, what brought this film to origin was the true horrors of any conflict, and how the way in which all the actions committed during the war reproduced only worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie in which you cheered on anyone but you both kidnapped the bad guy.
