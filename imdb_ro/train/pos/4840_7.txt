I saw the recent DVD region 2 of this movie displayed in the horror section of a Oxford Street store and also published as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost just a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in the British comedy and easy entertainment for over four decades. Perhaps his continued humorous, exuberant and essentially good-natureal humor comes as a bit of cultural shock for many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavor of many British comedies of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate its lively and cheerful character and the total avoidance of the pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who frequently borrowed the gag of "self-strangling," which Arthur tries to distract with jammed passengers. There is a striking appearance, seldom by Linden, Travers, which has an impact like the mysterious Julie.
