I am 14 years old and I like this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a good pair. This movie is very funny and I like the songs. My favorite songs are "You can not keep a good dog down" and that song about sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours." This was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played Anne-Marie's voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find that Itchy's voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I've actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares the asshole. Other characters like King Gator found it very funny. The end was adorable and in fact it was sad, made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
