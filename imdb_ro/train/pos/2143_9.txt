It's not the same as other dance films. A few ordinary people woke up from the dance. Unlike Hollywood dance films, the characters in this movie are not beautiful or hot young people. I'm a person you can see every day in your offices. They are depressed about their lives and in the end they find their dreams of dancing. This touches me deeply.
