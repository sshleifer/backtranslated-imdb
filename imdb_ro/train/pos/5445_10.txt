I saw this movie for the first time ten years ago and I thought it was really funny. It was not as bad as some critics have done to be. The fact that it was written by John Hughes, usually trusted, shows that you can expect at least a funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think Strange Science is pretty good, which was also written in the speed of lightning by Hughes). The film has a very brilliant look at it with all primary colors - red, yellow, etc. - making it look quite unique. The distribution is also pretty good. Bastard Bunny Packard and the deacon Delores Salk are out. The film certainly gave a bit, but I personally prefer it with the whole "Lampoon" series.
