Of course, if you read my review, you've already seen this movie. "Raja Babu" is one of my most favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled arm with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters etc etc I like the scene when a stone cracks in Kader Khan's mouth while eating. Also, if Shakti Kapoor reveals a story about Raja Babu's stuff on a table, and Govinda wearing the "dharam-veer" uniform makes sentimental remarks. This is my favorite scene of the movie. "Achcha Pitaji Main Chalta Hoon Scene" is just a chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue. It's genius. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors by helping each other and taking the scene from one another. The total fun. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan then you have to do it. I think RB is on the 6th place on my David Dhawan list. "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", Coolie No. 1 "precede this gem of a movie.
