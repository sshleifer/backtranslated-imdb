This is a wonderful movie if viewed in the right context - it was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-cult movies (and the 1980s saw a lot of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and I liked it right away. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a hateful metal preacher can not be bad! Fastway was already a favorite of me, so it was great to hear it on the soundtrack. The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) for Trick Or Treat presented an illustration of Sammi on his knees, singing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking at her. It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at that time (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not the ridiculous price. The "OZZY-Gene" cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release. The company that launched it probably believed that Gene and OZZY were the only people recognized in the movie, so they should have put them on the cover! The same is with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson has been in it for all five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if it were the main star. The site "Trick Or Treat" and it's surprising that many people think Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth by dedicating his soundtrack to Sammi Curr. Everything was just a good moment, the rock-n-roll movie. Surely, do not be too serious, just enjoy!
