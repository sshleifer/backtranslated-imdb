With movies like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Run Chicken" underneath the belt, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, now introduce us to a bit of twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts." <br /> <br /> Derived from a short one made early in the career, "Creature Comforts" is a slice show in which conversational fragments are removed from their context and given to a kind of animal. Aardman Animation went all over the country interviewing people with harmless questions like, "Are you a liar?" and then accelerate things up to a point asking them about their sexual life. The answers, while they seemed boring and worldly, are actually quite funny when you understand that dialogues come first and animals are added later. How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters discussing what she is looking for in a woman, "I like very thin." is an insect, Walking Stick. There are two dogs discussing smells and smells, while they swallow a poodle while talking about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. Just as "wife" tells litany that she is her health, her long-suffering husband, she stands by her without saying anything. While it may take some time for "Creature Comforts" to find "legs" it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the usual. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and certainly worth watching. Some of the humor might seem a little shaky, it's a camel that captures children's attention (like the old Batman series of the 1960s, the jokes are pretty subtle, the kids will not get them) and the jokes that are there for adults.
