Fraidy Cat, the fourth of these cartoons, is a good one. At least I liked it, so I'm surprised to receive mixed reviews. This is more a macabre story than a funny story, although it has comedy moments. The atmosphere is dark and scary. Suspicion is another powerful element here. As for humor, it is more humorless. In this short, Tom listens to a crazy radio show at night and is absolutely frightened because it's ghosts, something he thinks. While Tom is scared of death, Jerry follows everything and can not laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. Using a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner creates a great "ghost". Tom lives the most frightening experience of his whole life. Although Jerry scares Tom for no good reason, the way the story is done ends up being fun. In addition, once again there is no violence because it is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I do not get that joke from the nine lives of Tom almost aspired to the vacuum cleaner. When Tom finally found that Jerry was a Jerry program, and that Jerry had made him crazy, Jerry was "trapped in the chocolate jar" (it's worth it being discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. He was staring at Jerry for about a minute. Funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom looks at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be fun, but Tom does not laugh. Generally, this is a different, weird and remarkable experience of Tom & Jerry.
