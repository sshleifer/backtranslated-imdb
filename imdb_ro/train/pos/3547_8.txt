Musical entertainment where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000 to get a flood of nonsense so he urges Sky Masterson to try to get a rescue army played by Jean Simmons to go with Masterson in Havana. , Simmons would once again be a missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry". There was Sister Sharon and here is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. Frank Sinatra is the devil Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged with Vivian Blaine for 14 years and has lost his habit of playing. In a real rhythm change, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who actually made his own singing here! > <br /> The film is saved by superlative choreography. These dance and singing routines are fabulous. These are especially made by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). Overall, it is a very enjoyable production.
