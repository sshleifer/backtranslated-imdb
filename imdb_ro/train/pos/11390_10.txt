Story and music (George Gershwin!) They are wonderful, just like Levant, Guitar, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing and this thing is a good lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron is bothering me. However, in spite of it, the plot moves nicely with the famous (and deserved) Ballet. Colors, dazzling tomatoes, blues, green and yellow. We must not forget the beige. ; ) I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the brighter ballet. So I assume that what I am trying to say is: Please, by all means, see and rejoice, because although it is not the best, it is MARVELUS. But make sure you do not forget that another genre Gene Kelly with the 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to the beginning of the fair.
