JACKNIFE is an excellent adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow" (also written by Metcalfe) directed by David Hugh Jones, who explores the over-forgotten effect of the battle on the veterans who are definitively affected by the cruelty of war. It is particularly painful to return to this film in 1989 when we look at the soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the crude treatment they receive in our Veterans' hospitals. Three friends have gone to Vietnam together and only two come back to life: the problem is that while both men suffered a fight, David Flannigan's "High School" (Ed Harris) is so badly affected by the syndrome posttraumatic stress that "exists" in a drunk vacuum, sister Martha (Kathy Baker). While David is harming his girlfriend, Joseph Meinsey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city trying to help his friend. In the course of the events, Jacknife initially gives Martha support and, ultimately, the two encounters - in a Prom Martha must participate - and at that haunted David completely breaks down, destroying relics in school and frightening the inhabitants and students. Jacknife makes Dave come back to Vietnam when they lose their buddy, and David brings David to the point where he can begin his recovery. And those who suffer much suffering, Martha, find their needs also thanks to Jacknife. All three actors give a spectacular surprise: Ed Harris offers one of the most accomplished roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. More people should help resuscitate this film, yet forgotten, because it is a clear reminder of the damage our wars bring to the people who fight against them and the families that receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
