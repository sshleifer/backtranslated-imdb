I actually found this movie "interesting"; Finally it is worth the time to look and rent. It's true ... some scenes were over the top in terms of emotion, shout, etc. But what movie does not emphasize his agenda, genre or "ax"? Almost none! What surprised me is that I read another reviewer's review by S.Fran on another review site, but found his negative review instead of a more accurate description of his "own" review of the film; not film at all. Anyone looking at this movie will realize that it's great to recommend to family and friends; no trace of car, yes! Being "in" an Italian family, I can fully refer to the environment on the screen. The film also has broken parts. It is what real life can be in such an environment. Beautiful movie.
