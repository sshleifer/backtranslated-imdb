Fabulous costumes by Edith Head, who painted Liz Taylor at the very best! SFX are very good for a movie of her age, and stunt doubles, in fact, look like actors, even up to the body type, a rarity in the movies of this era. A comfortable film with splendid panoramas - even when cut down to draw and scan.
