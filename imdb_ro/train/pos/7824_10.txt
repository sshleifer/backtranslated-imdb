As many elders know, South Africa has long suffered under the racist oppression of apartheid, which has completely subjugated the black population. One of the best-known anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was killed in prison. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message to the world. In "Cry Freedom," Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested. When Woods tries to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin to live under the threat of an attack, and eventually are forced to flee the country. The last scene shows that the police burn the protesters. As one of the two movies (along with "A World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" makes it possible to outline the best work ever for all involved.
