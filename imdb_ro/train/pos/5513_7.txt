From what I read, many people were disappointed with this film, compared to Part 1. First of all, I could understand this, but after a little thinking I think they were wrong. Soderbergh continues to tell about Che's life that began in part 1. Part 1 has told a story about a revolution that has been moving from a nonprofit start to a successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that moves from nonprofittic beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life had completely different results. He chooses bravely to say so in a rather simple way. The visitor may feel much better to leave the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion the director's fault. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war, because the guerrillas were successful. In part 2, they can not take a break and see that their number is constantly reduced by death and catching. The capture and death of Che are treated well. The film is enhanced by the dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is once again excellent as the charismatic argentinian. So, if you saw Part One, you will see a very similar story about a very different story in Part Two.
