After seeing the horror film marathons a few times, I think it's a humorous parody that cuts itself to the main point of its references. Although the themes are crumbling and outdated for today's viewers, it's not a waste of time at all. Although being a student film does not give rise to an excuse, the proof is that it seems to be hand crafted on a little or no budget. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noticed, it's less than ten minutes, which is a period of time to clean the palace with a joyful bread, sit back and enjoy with joy through the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this short bread of a movie should enjoy an appetizer for the title reference, and the spectator should relax and roll with it.
