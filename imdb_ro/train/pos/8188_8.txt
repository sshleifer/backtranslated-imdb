I enjoyed very well the first part of the two floors, the Impossible Planet, and I was slightly worried that the second part could not bear quite well, as was true in the past of the two parties in the last 2 Series Who. But, fortunately, my fears were unfounded, I realized I was enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway, we start with crew members who survived the Ood road, which became Devil's pawn. There is also a little philosophy on the doctor's side in the episode that I enjoyed a lot. Needless to say, it was a good story, Doctor Who. It may be too tedious for young viewers, though. <br /> <br /> My degree: B +
