This movie had an interesting cast, but it did not have a distributed list, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have class b movies like this, the story is the basic actors are the basic and so is how it runs, you do not need a budget of one million dollars to make a movie just a combination of actors accustomed and a basic plot. I like how they had a street to themselves and that there was no one else and also what I was curious about is that they did not close a cafe to put there tools and they did everything from a section of police. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen have done a great job in putting their role in the hostage situation. This was a great movie and I hope to see more in the near future.
