Cinderella is one of Disney's biggest movies, one of those movies, I think you appreciate the age you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of classical fairy tale. I think the film was the biggest of his films at the time of his release. The characters have become more dimensional than previous films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters created by Disney. With her kindness and dry humor she is extremely pleasing; however, it is the inspiration it offers, which makes it memorable. Like many people she is an endless dreamer and she keeps her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most unfavorable situations, her dreams will endure and will not let anyone take it from her. Its example should serve as an inspiration for everyone and encouragement never to give up your dreams.
