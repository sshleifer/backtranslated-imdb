Brilliant! My wife and I joined our extended line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the movie, I understand why there was such a long line. Holly is an appealing story about an impossible link between two people. She's a young girl, she's a used wizard. The film caught every bone in our body. There are no graphical scenes or something hard to follow-it is the surrealism of normal that really hits you in the intestine. The movie is beautifully shot. Among other things, I loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's rawness (cant thinks this is her first thing acting) and Ron Livingston's performance has stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
