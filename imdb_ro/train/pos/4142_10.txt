FREE BUS TRANSPORTATION is simply the funniest, most original and fun thing you've ever had the pleasure of seeing. This film is by no means the Hollywood standard, the movie-comedy fluffy movie starring terry "hulk" hogan in terms of room, editing, acting, budget, or anything else. what this movie has, however, is an original story and a pleasant story and is obviously made by people who love to do it, and the enthusiasm of the entire distributor and crew really falls into its budget and goes down. This movie proves that you do not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and a passion for what you do. simply the best movie ever. I do not care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just see this movie. Now I hope to make a DVD version.
