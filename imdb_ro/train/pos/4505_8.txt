Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural gap between an indigenous population and a white man who has broken the law. Although filmed in a seemingly unprofessional documentary style, Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a credible story that the audience will want to see until the last shot. The native eschimus simply has different beliefs and behaviors related to women and life than whales that darken the landscape. When an Eskimos man loses his partner, it is normal for other men to share their women with their boyfriend. It is also customary for their women to want to take the place of the missing husband. All this seems to be natural in the context of the desolate transformation of the Arctic region. Confident Eskimo is a prey for unscrupulous whales (with heavy European accents) who do not see these natives as equal. Deceit, drunken orgies, rape and death take place after the Eskimos men leave to work in the cold cold sea. Eventually the Eskimo leader (Mala) realizes that he has been deceived and takes revenge. The audience would be applauded in theaters of the 1930s. Enter the Canadian Royal Police and the moral dilemma of bringing back the Maltese. Ammunition plays like policemen who feel it's not a dry and cut case. Monsies will take their man? Is it right to hold Mala to a code of conduct outside of his traditional society? Is there a way out who does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law prevail? Is there no hope for innocence? This is not a great movie, but one that you will enjoy the depth of the problem addressed in a very different setting. I suspect that the filming of animal sequences was made before today's decline that no one was hurt in making the film - beware of the crude sequences. Highly recommended.
