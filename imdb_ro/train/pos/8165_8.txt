The dentist was done when almost every profession had a psyche. We had crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretaries, and that was just for the beginning. The dentist came up surprisingly late because the dentist is usually a human nightmare. The land is twisted. Doctor Feinstone lives perfectly in the biggest "white house", has a beautiful blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. The dark clouds are approaching the horizon, like an ugly Earl Boen of Terminator's IRS, a dirty pool cleaner, "cleaning up" his wife, and suddenly all his teeth seem to have gone through the dark filter. He hurries and begins to take care of the teeth of the people badly. And you do not want to get in his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was a professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has made horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a beautiful spinoff from John Carpenter's Live. Producer Pierre David is known from films such as Scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really upset me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I was able to dream him like a dentist. He was really great in his role and he was a sad person. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and bad as the wife of Feinstones. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him with the ladies in the neighborhood, I knew my profession of the future. Ken Foree (The Dawn of the Dead, beyond) was a beautiful sight as a policeman in the back. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager to be the next client of Feinstone. Final warning: If you are like me and have problems with your dentist then you should skip it. But if you want to try than to prepare yourself with black humor and many ugly blasts.
