Spoilers! From the moment I saw a local critical film on this movie in a news magazine at 10:00, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who it was or which local news Omaha did the review, but the critic was very insistent that this movie was too unpleasant for the average church that went Nebraskan. They showed a fragment from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when swimming in the pool. Glover's character appreciates how beautiful her body is, and so on, using many words that the local station deemed necessary to edit them. I was coupled. It was a problem, though. I was only 13 years old and I had to wait a year until it came out. Let's say, it was worth waiting! If it was ever a pleasure to blame me, this movie is. To call this film indifferent would be a huge understatement. The film focuses around a successful businessman, blackmailed by three wounded after an adventure with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a small blow and now is at the mercy of three villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable people of all time. He's noisy, funny sometimes and always on the point of doing something crazy. Then is the character of Robert Trebor (beautiful name, by the way!) Leo, who is clearly in his head with this blackmail scheme. She is a whimpering, sweating coward who runs a show with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a terrible sociopath, everybody afraid of a good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call that Vanity gives with the giant bear bears? After dealing with the initial shock to figure out what is happening against him, Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation until Glover goes after his wife! Conflict is played brutally, practically with all distribution shot, raped or thrown into the air. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. I should really crawl, but not. Maybe because these characters are interesting, and the story has many chances that most of today's films will never try. It is scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters, such as Glover running in LA looking for trouble. Just thinking of his voice is enough to make me giggle. "Hey sport, you have a nice day!" This movie has a lot of fireworks, cool cars, great dialogue (as the line in my opening statement), and acting decent. A lot of real porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy to pray in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to say is: how hot are women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta did well by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity becomes nude in a time before she becomes Christian again. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her, except that she is the most beautiful American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> That's what the Hound says. <br /> <br /> Added February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
