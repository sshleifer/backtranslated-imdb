I have to say that Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but none of them captured the pure glory with which this game tackles its horrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which is attached to the horror of our world and shows that his hand is clear everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is at stake as one of the main characters. Completely lush visuals and atmosphere enough to shake a stick, Undying is the game of beating in my books as the best title of horror. I just want this to have reached a console system, but the weak PC sales have been filled by itself.
