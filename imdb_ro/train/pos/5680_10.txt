Cute, this is so hysterical! Why are not such American comedies written? For someone who thinks the comedy must be bad - there are more intelligence and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a Roman rack! Hugh Laurie is a complete shot. I could not believe he was the same guy with the house! There are so many great lines and gags in this series that you can watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the biggest and put on the Edmund button. This is my favorite Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is great as always the somewhat obfuscated heart of the series, "oppressed table" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone gets sick with a Wellington, really puts his foot in it," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder, the "top seller in leather" and the swordsman killed in Scotland.
