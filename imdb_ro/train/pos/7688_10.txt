Back in 74 Eric Monte made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I like to see Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Estera Rolle. John Amos has felt a bit jealous of the popularity of Jimmie Walker, who has won millions of fans to sit and watch the Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ had not been there to save it with Kool Aid at all times. Consumption of alcohol KOOL was a favorite thing in the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979, it would have taken longer than in the 1980s, when we grew up.
