An American in Paris is a wonderful musician about an American painter who lives in Paris for inspiration. She meets a rich woman who admires her paintings on the street and thinks she can make her work even more popular with the public, in a museum. The Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect for both singing and dancing. She also meets with the main girl Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron), who is engaged to her best friend. She can not help her feelings for this girl, even after she finds out who she's hired. Completed with a beautiful love and a wonderful song and dance, this is a very good musical movie. Maybe he could easily drag him with the dream dance sequence, that is, the American ballet in Paris, but there is a good happy ending.
