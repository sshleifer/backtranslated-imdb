This movie is one of my favorite of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy have turned into one. The final battle scene to this day gives me chills and the end always leaves me a tear. If you have not seen him, I would strongly recommend.
