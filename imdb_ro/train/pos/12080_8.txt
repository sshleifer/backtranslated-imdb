Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to hire herself as secretary of the rich Hughes family to get her boyfriend to leave her. Almost immediately, she is drugged and shipped to the Cornwall family property. When she wakes up, they tell her she's Marion Hughes, she's been mentally ill, and she's keeping her in jail ... but why? You will probably guess why, but do not bother because it's fun. Together with "Narrow edge" and "Face behind the mask" this is one of the best B photos ever made. (B photos were low budget budgets made with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it should be (just 65 minutes), it's well-directed, fast and exciting. It only happens at the end I found a little too implausible to buy. Foch (a good actress) is just good in the lead, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as a bastard. Well, it's worth catching. A perfect example of how to make a great movie at a small budget.
