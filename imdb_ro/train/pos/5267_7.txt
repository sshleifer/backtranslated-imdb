It seems that Ruggero Deodato realized from the beginning that his story would not work if he had approached her too seriously, so he decided to bring it. The result is a movie that can be regarded as a mad epic of sword and witch or as a very fun comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The short moments of the gorillas are doing well, Paul Brothers openly scoff at the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!) And there is also a charming, lively, good-natured performance by Eva La Rue who labels along with the "boys." In addition, where else do you see the interior of a lighted dragon as a disco? (***)
