I have to admit that from EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, this must be the one I love most, as well as the one I have. The story is something that really follows you. Many of the EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer that broke it in pieces before production when you watch it. All the centers around sex, and who can get with different people the end of the movie. And dear God, never watch one of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work that it's almost ridiculous, but you do not want to lose energy to do that. "Loss of control" is exactly as it happens in his name. The protagonist, the main character (wonderful and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control a person has on his senses, body and feelings. And a man is changing everything for her, making her a very different woman. But the mirror is shattered at the same time. This makes for a great movie I wished I came with the first! <br /> <br />
