I do not doubt that critics shot this film, especially those who need a laxative. This is an excellent vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or, more recently, Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change the movies forever. What it will do is have fun. When everything is said and done, it is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget your problems. It even has a simple and good moral message, no extra charge. I've always loved Elvira's television show when I lived in LA. She did not really steal her Vampira schism more than Vampira did from the original Theda Bara. This type of mythical character belongs to the one who does the best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; we need more such films. They are never enough. The bastard, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. It releases a wonderful refined evil. We could not find technical defects. Execution is as close to the best art form. I deeply thank the director, James Signorelli, and his entire crew.
