*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** Well, seeing that I'm a big fan H: LOTS, maybe I liked the movie more than ordinary people would do. However, this movie is still excellent. They had a lot of surprises and gave more time to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
