This zip and short fun of 1916 - when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the greatest names in comedy - portrays young Oliver Hardy as a neer-do-well, who must impress his rich uncle, producing a wife and baby for his visit. Of course, this does not work well and soon there are more wives and children than it can do; plus repetitions and mandatory misunderstandings that are the hallmark of the early film slapstick. Restored well and can be seen as part of the movie "Early Films of Oliver Hardy" and is now available on DVD, a fine added to the body of the favorite comedic duo on the big screen.
