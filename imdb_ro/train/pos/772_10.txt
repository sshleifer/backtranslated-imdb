Love is overwhelming ... In all are manifestations ... Wonderful, absolutely superb ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about the undeclared ways of young hearts, about life and lost innocence, all led by Tudor Giurgiu's mysterious eye. With a magnificent soundtrack with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, he surprises in any way, leaving behind the sour taste of the misunderstanding of love ... Really remarkable ... I am my Romanian cinema, slowly but surely, advancing gaining respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two fingers to all those involved.
