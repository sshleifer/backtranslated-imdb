A sweet film that will not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace," seems to be cut from the same cloth as half of other British comedies in the past two years ... Underdog faces adversity, finds the power to challenge and learns something about himself in the process. Widowed and broken, Grace is a gardener and is invited to help her boyfriend, Matthew, grow up her plant. She did everything wrong, so Grace helped him out. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest the pots, which they can also benefit from. He enjoys smoking, needs to raise funds to pay his mortgage. It is obvious that Grace travels to London to treat some of her goods, dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta wore in Saturday Night Fever and is therefore missing like a big finger. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always watched and you can not say that about a lot of people ... but anyway, I can not. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, who liked me in La Femme Nikita, is memorable. <br /> <br /> Do not move deeply or insightful, but extremely fun, and at a time of 90 minutes, it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
