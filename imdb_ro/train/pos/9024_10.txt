Five years later, Tenko survivors returning home, and Marion with a double-edged "Well That's That". Now is 1950: the time of the meeting. The band is also here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and Maggie and Alice's delay. The story that is unfolding is a beer: as being perfectly written and acted, and as a provocative and moving thinker, like the original series. All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are tidy responses here. From Marion's family to Joss's health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best. A trip to the Dominica plantation brings a lot of shocks and some truly cutting-edge stool tension. There is a real feeling of tragedy and disaster, because once again fate takes over and women are fighting for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colors and there are a few moments of drama shouting on television. Shooting the lush location in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It is a shame that this really is the end. I could see everything again. Perfection.
