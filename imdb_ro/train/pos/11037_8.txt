I know it is unlikely that the French detainees read Lovecraft (and this proves that his writings should be taught at school, maybe a separate subject), but how they thought something that seems to be "ftagn yog sototh "leads to any good? The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely staggering cell fellow on a magic book who can, if read right, pull them out. With the prison, the cell was totally unrealistic, which made it hard for me to enter the atmosphere of things. It also moves slowly enough, which can lead to people. But something else is a horror feeling, mixing "the fuck" of Sartre with other Lovecraft / Barker guys, and you're doing pretty well. Bottom line: this. This means you do not do it when you are about to go to work or sleep or while you do something else. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons Learned: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
