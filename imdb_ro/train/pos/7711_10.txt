Okay, so Robbie is a bit hockeyed by today's standards, and some of the actors are fairly quenched, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright, 12-year-old child with a decent computer editing program. And do not make me start with the poster. This is still a wonderful movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up watching "science fiction" on Science Fiction / Adventure Theater television on Sunday afternoon, so I saw quite a few SF movies in the 1950s. At a time when most of the films were happy to put someone in a rubber suit and demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie who actually had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films made in the '90s will still be considered merit watched in 2030.
