This film, though over 70, is still a very moving and powerful film. Bette Davis, as delicious, vicious, Cildney Mildred, is absolutely credible. Watching her performance is still spellbinding. It makes the viewer absolutely despise her and love her at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as a weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I do not see how an actor could figure out the performance of Mr. Davis. She chews the landscape in every scene they are in, totally steals the show. This is the film that sealed his style and deserved the Oscar, but he lost. It has been shocking for today with unintended pregnancy topics, multiple sex partners, and vicious Mildred's language, so it's somewhat dated but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what he truly believes about him ("You fall, you swine swine ....") is still one of the biggest actors I've ever seen in the movie.
