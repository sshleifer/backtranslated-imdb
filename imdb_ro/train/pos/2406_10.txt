this is the best showing of what I think was really like Jesus. most movies show that Jesus is effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played and was serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of people of Jesus that might be attracted to, not the Hollywood version of it. The film took some liberties, trying to "fill the gaps". but stuffing did not seem impossible or even unlikely. one thing I could support was that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film showed that the Romans were the main engine of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against this idea) . /> It seemed to me that the movie was well researched. an example was an inadmissible commentary to a teenage boy who was called a "brand." it is believed that the mark (or john mark) was the boy referred to in the Ghettsman's Garden, whose cloak was pulled and empty (Mark 14:51). I have the feeling that they have tried to make the movie as accurate as possible (even in spirit) as much as possible.
