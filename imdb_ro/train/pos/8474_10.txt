I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I really liked dana plato, who played later in various shots like a kimberly drummond. I do not think it's litter. It was not supposed to be a continuation of the documentary. is just a nice kids movie about 3 kids going after men trying to find a rich brook monster. men hurt and the children save them with the creature. The photos of the marsh and landscape of Arkansas were neat. this is a good movie for children, no real violence, a few light scary but fun for young children.
