Hayao Miyazaki's name became prominent with "Spitied Away," but what is often overlooked is the director's first film. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed the THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments from this movie - almost certainly in the last 45 minutes in the late 1980s, and what really left me was the visual luxury of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known store for Â£ 9, I could not resist, but I bought it. A strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not match my memory (memory is amusing in this way). Watching this movie now with all the knowledge gained about the portfolios of artists is as much as Jean 'Moebius' Giraud part of the artwork is. I can only take some influence. When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's past part of Gulliver's Travels. With sound references to Jules Verne, it is a good and bad base movie, with the final portion having the heroes ending on Laputa. This is the most powerful part of my memory - pastoral - the ecological appearance of Laputa has returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered with muscles under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the culmination of the film - the views of the Laputa surface, unlike the mechanized underground. Although this is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that tends to garden and animals. The end of Silent Running is almost exactly the same thing. It's incredibly stylish, I would not say "slick" - very nice and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in buildings, airships and the design and layout of everything she does. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and enjoy it.
