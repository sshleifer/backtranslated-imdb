I saw yesterday "The Grudge", and wow ... I was very scared, a good thing. I like horror movies and I really enjoyed it. There were so many "surprising" scenes (which is the English word?) Which made you jump for you. Though too many public screaming made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus, when the face turns on the window or when Yoko goes without a chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you could even see that it was there, but still add a strange look to the scene. The boy was really very good, so cute, without makeup and so terribly scary. The next time I hear a breaking noise, I'll probably feel scared enough ...
