The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply, the movie was spectacular media. It's not bad, but it's not very good. Editing is good; the movie is well-paced. The department is competent and insured. The story is fertile. The film is typically Ledger, Bloom, and Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US, so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or how I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the movie I was neither bored nor moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say that I did not care about this point. Indeed, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom is a kind, present "I'm pretty confused" aspect is prominent) so fangirls can find it worth the matinee price. Besides, you do not see him. It is neither good enough nor bad enough to be fun.
