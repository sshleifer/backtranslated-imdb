This game is very addictive, I continued to play it for hours until late at night, but the fact that you can not save a game when you are in space contributed to it, sometimes I had to play for not to lose any game data . So yes, "freelancer" is addictive, but also quite erroneous. Also, for example, something that bothered me a lot was that you could not jump over any of the cut scenes, so sometimes you had to watch the same scenes shortly after a while. A great opportunity for me to make more money to check my emails or have a chat with my friends and many other things of this kind, while I had to wait for the cut scene to end. of promise, but the more you get louder everything becomes. Also, the game ends too suddenly, at least for me. It is quite obvious that they suggest a future follow-up. I do not know if this is a sequel, but I'm sure I will probably choose one after it's released. How to play is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To boldly say, every crazy can play this game. Yes, some levels are pretty tough and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which could be too short. But thank God for the choice for more players! It allows you to continue playing short missions, just like the unique game of players once you've finished your journey. Even if the mission batch is the same, it simply stays cool to be in the midst of sometimes massive dogfights. <br /> <br /> Graphics are good, but not just revolutionary or anything else. <br /> <br /> Addictive play but beware of its defects. <br /> <br /> 7/10
