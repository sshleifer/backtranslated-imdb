Both visually and musically amazing. A treatment for both the eye and the ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences was totally delightful, contributing to creating a Christmas scene that Dickens himself was reasonably proud of. From a technical point of view, production is a visual stimulant, and the special effects are imaginatively designed and creatively created in a traditional scene. The dance of many of the lead artists is astonishingly good. Photography and lighting are top class, and the sound recording fits admirably to the high level of technical skills used. A great movie for all the family at Christmas and a very delightful breakthrough that will resist multiple viewing.
