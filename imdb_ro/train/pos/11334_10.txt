I would say that this film provides insight into the trauma a young man can think of when a family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I would recommend this film especially to parents or people who intend to have a family. I found the characters to be appealing and extremely sympathetic in a multitude of sizes. <br /> <br /> A scared monster, though probably not scary for most adults, has a very real idea of ​​what can create the hyperactive imagination of a child who is experiencing unknown terror. I found the movie to be delightful!
