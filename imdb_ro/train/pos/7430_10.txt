Personals I really loved this movie and I moved especially. The two main actors give us so great shows that, in the end, he really is ashamed to know what happened to their characters at last. The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is great and the song is great as it is. <br /> <br /> That's why I did not feel surprised when I found out that she won 5 golden prizes at the Golden Globe, the Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that is worth seeing by anyone. A great movie that was often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in him, certainly as a "co-director"). Her art is the greatest, and you will certainly be pleased!
