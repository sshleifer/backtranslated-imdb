The previous reviewer told me exactly. I saw it once, I was enchanted, I saw it the second time it was broadcast within a week or two of the first broadcast. I still remember some of the scenes. The setting is the opening of the twentieth century, the war referred to in the title is the First World War. One of the scenes was set in a section dedicated to women in a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my moments of film over time. I do not think of it as a homosexual film, it's a love story of an interesting and delicate time when the two main men happen to be women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy it if it ever appears on DVD.
