What was it about 1939 that helped produce many excellent Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it is, magic can be found in this picture in Colombia. It's a long forgotten comedy that Turner Classic Movies has begun to show. (Maltin's film does not contain it). In almost all departments, Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel. It's the story of a first-class police detective who can never find time to marry him. As wedding bells are about to ring, he's called to the crime scene. The lady concerned must learn how hard not only to enjoy the pursuit of offenders but the police. There is a lot of laughter in this process. Melvyn Douglas once again proved to have had some colleagues in the light comedy. Joan Blondell is at the top of his career and is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. The movie goes too long, but who cares? Screensavers are always capable of having fun, and this film belongs to the best.
