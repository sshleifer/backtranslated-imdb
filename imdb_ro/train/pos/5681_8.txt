We had no problem with the movie, which I thought pretty good. It's the real LAPD scene video that bothered me. I wonder if the Lion's Gate really believed that the general viewing audience would like to see people who were brutally beaten to death and blood everywhere. I'm sorry about the Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA! Return to film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes's delay. John Holmes was a dull, maltreated woman in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he is hopelessly deep in drugs. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that has killed the infamous Wonderland. Just how was Holmes involved in the crimes? We may never know the whole truth about the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the movie does a good job, though.
