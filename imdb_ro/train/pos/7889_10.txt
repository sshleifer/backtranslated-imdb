Freddy's film, the dead night of the nightmare, is as horrible and disturbing as any other Elm Street nightmare has a comedy essay about him, just like all other movies, but how can anyone say he does not you will find Freddy Krueger If you met this man in your dreams, you would not have found him even more scary with a comic essence about him, because his comedy shows he does not care at all that he kills you he finds extraordinary funny, and Freddy also plays comedy games with them which in his way is very disturbing by using his comic ways I think he makes horror films Nightmare on Elm street what I am today the writers are extreme by intelligent Krueger making comic and frightening opposed to Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and is not allowed to scare his victims really, this film is as good as Freddy's wisdom and I would recommend give it to anyone with a sense of humor and fashion "Do not sleep! ".
