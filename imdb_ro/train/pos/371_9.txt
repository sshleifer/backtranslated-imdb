I remember when this movie was for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For my life, I do not remember what happened, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me a little. Essentially, it is the black woman's trials and tribulations as she grows from one girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and awful, but all are necessary to see how much this woman has borne. Along the way, we see other women who had to resist their burdens and go with them for redemption. Whoopi Goldberg offers the best performance in this movie. Danny Glover should have been at least nominated for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this film is that it treats human subjects, not as weird performances as the latest "Beloved." I encourage anyone in any race to see this movie. 9/10
