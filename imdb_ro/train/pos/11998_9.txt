This movie was beautiful. It was filled with memorable images, good action and subject matter. It would be very easy to write it as too sentimental, but that is the feelings this movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the story development and presentation. There were some photos of cheese, but this is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can make is that there was not a ton of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, the minister, triumphs, controversies, Joseph Smith's failures, etc. was designed for a brief look at some important points of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
