I have seen a lot of really negative messages by those who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the United States, at least until mid-September. Perhaps they are unhappy expats who live in South Korea who saw it early. I'm in the US and I just saw her today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we're all accustomed to this from many other movies. It was not at all difficult to follow. The actor was weak, but the others were pretty good. It was humor. I rated it at 8, because I had a good view, for which I went.
