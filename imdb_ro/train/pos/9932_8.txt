If you go to this movie waiting for something that is not, you will be disappointed, as in any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as "the effect of the iceberg". On the surface, simply a cache of random video clips were crushed to make a movie. If it were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the film is very fast, and if you do not try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle pretexts) may well go through. Certainly a movie will have to see twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinema barely describes this movie. Filming and post-production work adds much to the overall flavor of the film, making it quite artistic in some places and open to interpretation in others (something that is wanted to be wanted in American films at the end of the year). Although some may become a bit mischievous, tough and too hard for some audiences, the film does not become completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write as "requiring improvement" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a suitable soundtrack and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is a bit too long, and the other rap songs in the movie could have been replaced by something more appropriate (rock hard, primed or psychedelic electronics would have made this movie a true journey). Flooding dynamic images and color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect, combined with events that happen throughout the movie, this is not a movie that you miss and understand. However, this also makes much more a desirable movie, not one that you'll get bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
