I'm glad that other people enjoyed this movie because I know it does not have the greatest reputation and did not make money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are many reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the toughest touches, distribution (especially Coleen Field) is perfect and Big Bad Apple never looks better on the film. You've seen worse movies!
