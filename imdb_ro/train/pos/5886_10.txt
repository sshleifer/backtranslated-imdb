Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination of new meeting / shooting. Watch him and look forward to the sixties! Mary defies the youth-oriented society with spirit and charm. A drama of drama adds 2000 realism. A series of television follow-ups would widen the new characters and give us the chance to occasionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
