<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw her while I was in college in the early 1990s, and while I could not identify myself with the thirty-half of the film, I felt that the story, the characters and the movie were generally a top note . For those who spoke badly about Indian summer, do not hesitate to stick to Armageddon movies and leave the movies with a great and healthy story to those who can appreciate them.
