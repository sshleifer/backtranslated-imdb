With this topic, it's easy to take cheap photos. You know, the hairy-type guy trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone who cares deeply and therefore you feel for his situation trying to live as much as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but Geraldine, looks good! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel loved for each other, and even if they look at each other at the breakfast table. Even the subsection of the potentially thin sub-story of corporate takeovers is credible and you find applause at the end! At least I did!
