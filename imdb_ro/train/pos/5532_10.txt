Perhaps I am biased towards foxes, fox stories and yet I thought this was wonderful. I really liked it being shown when Lily was not comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to ruin too much here). I think it is important for children to see and try to understand. After reading some other comments, I am a little confused, says that at the end of the year - her mother and son appear, she was the one who told the son about her story. The movie I saw did not have my mom or son at the end, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone brighten me? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which could make it difficult for big kids to sit down. Still worth it if I can sit still.
