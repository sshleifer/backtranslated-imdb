How amazing is this movie! I've seen it several times over the years and I'm always brilliant. The reason why the film is so easy to follow is, of course, the performance of the young Bette Davis's arrest. Not only does it steal every scene they are in, but it is actually more beautiful and better photographed here (not to be more sexy) than in any of the films she has made so far in her studio home, Warner Brothers by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those great big eyes (especially in restaurant scenes taking place in Soho, London). Her body was so curvaceous when she was young. Take a load in the cheap carelessness it carries for the big scenes of explosive confrontation with Leslie Howard. And boy, she's an absolute power in that scene. Howard is a little too nervous over time, but he captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee plays the cute, fairly young Sally who truly loves him. Max Steiner's score is so charming and wizarding. The splendid spectacles and the thirty flavors of this have to see the version of the classic novel.
