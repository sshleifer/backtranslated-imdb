There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much. This short crap does not make anything more than what it gives to the public. It presents a simple story, said very clearly with enough wisecracks to keep you, then it just gets better and better. Clooney's Clooney is fun and very welcome, but leaders, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do it on their own. Very enjoyable and funny, hilarious, so to the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the horde genre.
