"Such a Long Trip" is a well-done film, a good film and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a mess of subplots and special characters that become a sort of Jack of all plots and master of no one. Also, Western audiences will probably find the esoteric Parsee culture quite obscure, a little too much to get arms around 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
