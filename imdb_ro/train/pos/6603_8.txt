I have to mention two failures to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded in failing: "A Darkly Scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two movies and you felt disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy the Renaissance. It bathes you in the world of the future Paris. He's not quite dystopian. They made the animation so good that I thought it was rotoscopic, but what I can say was not just the catch. Facial expressions are amazing! Not from TRON I have seen a fantasy world so well presented in a live animation / hybrid. The black and white environment is used to slowly turn attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with the headlamp beams, watch them. The director plays with attention and confusion, but you are finally satisfied with finding the thread you want to find. The general effect is an urban and gravely world full of small surprises. The land is secondary, but it's not terrible. It's noir-ish. There is a backstory for most major characters that give them a certain depth. It's time. There are "sets" so you can feel that you are in different places in Paris. There is an action and even a tracking of the cars. I will have to see this again to get it all. We also recommend a very large screen to see it because the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
