This final episode Voyager begins 23 years in the future. Voyager did it home. In many years that have persisted, Vulcan Tuvok's mind was destroyed. He had a disease that they were too late, getting home to heal. Captain Janeway meets with aliens who have travel technology over time. He realizes there is a Warp pipeline in the Delta Quadrant that could bring home Voyager home - if he could come back in time and notify Voyager. There is a problem. Conduct is deep in the Borg space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. It's like a baby. He screaming tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, is convinced they are important in a way. In the institution, Tuvok laments, asking "Janeway" to please, please come back to him. Janeway decides to command a federation shuttle and equip it with gun technology 20 years before the Borg in hopes of returning over time and using this new technology to guide Voyager to Warp Conduit. When she returns over time and connects with Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok asking if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits it's true, but he can not be healed by the ship's facilities, so he kept it for him. The young captain agrees with the larger plan of the captains. To increase their chances of success, Janeway Bigger intends to distract the Borg with the transfer craft. The Borg actually captures Janeway and her shuttle. Regina Borg personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway waited for it! Queen Borg has assimilated a virus itself that kills her. With the dead Voyager of the Borg Queen, he goes back to the federation.
