The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is essentially what it is, so we are not constantly fighting against that convincing truth. In this sense, we find peace. Stylish in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us to understand. In this film, the director tells us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful and simple story, more a fabula that plays very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than just seeing the actors. I tried to write a review of this wonderful movie so that others were motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in a bathroom. It sounds like a real stop, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this film is "The Shower," but this is almost an antithesis of a major theme in this movie, which is the bathroom. I'm still at a loss. Talking about the story or the characters will not do justice to them. So, I only tell you how I liked to see this movie and how moving and moving was the experience. I was also quite amused. I deeply cared for the characters and cared deeply about what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest form of praise. If you've been moved by movies like Masked King or None, then make sure you see the Shower. Netflix o has and the quality of DVD video and audio are excellent. I looked at it in the original chain, with well-made English basement well placed. <br /> <br />
