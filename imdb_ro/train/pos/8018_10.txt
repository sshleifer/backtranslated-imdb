In this movie Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their music to Manhattan Melodies. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet Muppets. After being denied by too many manufacturers, Scooter suggests that Muppets decides to go on his own. However, Kermit still thinks she can do her show on Broadway, but after she finally did and everyone knew that she sold the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others do not know where she is. > It features many extraordinary scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced Muppet Babies, a Muppets-filled wedding sequence including Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter Rizzo and other rats preparing breakfast . My only complaint is that more characters have not been included. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Mayhem Electric in this movie, as it was in the last season The Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper, and the Miss Figgy Foo Foo dog should have been with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, had an important role in this film and was not very well known then).
