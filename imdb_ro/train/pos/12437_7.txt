As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this movie on DVD without great hopes of joy; Indeed, I was expecting to be dismayed by the remote control within fifteen minutes. Instead, I enjoyed this production and I enjoyed it and I especially appreciated how the producers and the director managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of making a movie version (the worst) of the books we are all so familiar with, instead choosing to focus on a period of Modesty's life, alluding to the novels only. for the production values ​​(and I'm not a student at the cinema!): yes, the movie was filmed on a tight budget and time budget and maybe it looks ... but it does not ruin the spectator's joy? In this case, I think not. Instead, we are present at one of the greatest literary heroines in the world and have given us a taste of capabilities. As for casting: because on an unknown territory the only ones that matter are Modesty and) Professor Lob. For me, they were totally credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wood, and too thin to be a heroine of action, brought to light the modest screen and coolness; her technique (when martial arts were required), but most importantly, she personified the integrity underlying the Modesty Blaise canon. OK, so we all know that this movie was produced in the interest of Miramax Modesty Blaise character, it was made fast and cheap, but ... I can not wait to see the next production in this series by these manufacturers - so long as they keep to the core values ​​and features of the original stories!
