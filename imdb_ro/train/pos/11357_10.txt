"Citizen X" is the fantastic story about hunting for one of the worst serial killers of history. What makes this story even more convincing is where and when it happened; Soviet Union in the 1980s. ** Light Spores ** Viktor Burakov (magnificently played by Stephen Rea) is a newly-promoted criminal forensic researcher for the Rostov militia. He discovers unresolved crimes of the past and present, apparently of the same person. Crimes are not resolved because no one ever has problems investigating the evidence properly. He is led to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourage the search for truth. His naivety would have led to failure if it had not been for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a wise political cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a killer to justice, even if the party's official line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" Locations and sets are the perfect recreation of the Soviet life. Randy Edelman's play is especially good. More importantly, this film presents a criminalized and disturbing phenomenon, both intense and polite. This was a film made by HBO Films and became an excellent resource for films that would otherwise not have been achieved.
