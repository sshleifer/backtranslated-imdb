Just understand. The DVD is inexpensive and easy to pass, the length is now standard, and you left pretty much without it. (When the video started home, there were at least three versions with missing pieces ..) Everything you read is true. There is no defense and no life without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at, and the production values ​​are pretty good for an epic episode on Saturday afternoon. But no question .. the whole Santa Vs. Satan's angle is so towering Falling STRANGE made the movie a hit on time and a cult courtesy once home video really began underway. How good / bad / odd / is it? I saw only the TRAILER as a child and I remembered for almost 30 years ... including Murray's over the top voice. I told my older sister and called me a liar and did not realize it was maybe anyone can make a movie in Santa vs. Satan. Add to him things like Santa asking for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before they go on Christmas Eve, children who want to capture and make him SLAVE ... and an international sweat shop for children. probably approaching a lot of nightmares that children had in the 1960s. Like others here, I look at work every holiday season now. (My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But any old way you choose, the movie is a dementia masterpiece and a total mustache (along with Brian, by the way.) Never make me laugh. Better, I guess, then CLAUS SANCES THE MARTIANS. Part of it can make you pinch or just crawl (How many parents know I'm out for dinner on Christmas Eve? "If you get bored, go down and sing piano" DANG ..) Freaky, boring, disturbing , funny, childish, weird ... Hey, what do you want?
