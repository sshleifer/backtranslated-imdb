David Lynch's (1999) story about John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time before the release of the film. Come to Alvin Straight's life (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. It does what it decides to do, even more remarkable and dear. He decides (and at every point of the film his own name reverbs through his actions) to put a few straight things. Alvin is, at this point in his life, a man of great experience, but modest means. Rose's daughter (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on behalf of the public. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can only help you get out while the movie progresses. This is the story of a trip. But, like all trips, it is a journey in the geographical and human sense. At the beginning of the movie, we begin to understand that it is an ambitious journey that no elderly gentleman in Alvin's age should reasonably undertake. But, along the way, we learn slowly how Alvin has so many qualifications that he equips him to achieve his goal unlikely. Its objective is simple and simple. His brother is ill and is likely to die and wants to visit him. He had a fall with him many years ago and they did not speak in a very long time. On the way, Alvin encounters many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefits they receive from his knowledge is the essence of this film. We get to know who Alvin Straight is, what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are ... better.
