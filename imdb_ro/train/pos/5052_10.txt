This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, much of it is familiar, winter, canoeing, traps, hunting and the like. It's easy to get familiar for granted, but after watching this movie a few times grew up on me. The Story of Gray Owl is well known by many Canadian credit to director Attenborough and writer Nicholson script to expand the story. Brosnan well describes a complex man, a very fine performance. Annie Galipeau is wonderful in her first important role. The rest of the cast is solid.
