If you have not already seen this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?" This is another extraordinary and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathing (landscape)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenery here anyway! Would any real fan want otherwise? Of course not! Anyway; is a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not already seen it, then you just have to do this now! I mean now! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Honestly, Rick Morris
