This movie was seen by my wife and me when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation for us. In fact, we thought we were the only homosexual and lesbian young woman who had married and had children. Obviously I was wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect and maybe you do not want it. But we both chose love anyway. And no, it has never changed our sexual orientation. This kind of thing is for Christian wackos. When we were young we both had business, but never with the opposite sex. As I grew older, I stopped the extra-marital affairs. This story is not taken over at all. However, the suggestion that they have become heterosexuals seems quite unrealistic to me. My wife and I have slept together for the last 40 years. We're still gay. The end of the story.
