My friend and we both enjoyed this movie very much. The visitor is away from modern life in old Japan, while being exposed to very current themes. Characters are realistic and detailed; has an unpredictable ending and story, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-plots of the life of several geysers living together in a poor neighborhood. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic story or a life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
