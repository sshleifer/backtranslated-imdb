I just saw this movie and I have to say, I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has many moments that will make you jump out of the chair! I had to smoke more "emergency" cigarettes along the way to comfort my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that, maybe, if there were anything, there were too many jump times. It has reached the point where each new scene has jumped up and this has gradually carried the surprising effect, because you have been something new. Although it contains almost every clich√© in the ghost genre, everything was done so well as to keep the scary fear factor. He had elements of The Shining, The Sixth Sense and The Changeling (especially the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!
