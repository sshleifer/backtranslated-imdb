"Amazing Grace" has a bright sense for him because he tells a contemporary story of different lives in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. Observe family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal aplomb. He does not judge the characters, but only presents them in a direct manner, trying to discover their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the act is very good, and the observations made on the characters are very clear. I really appreciate this dramatic film.
