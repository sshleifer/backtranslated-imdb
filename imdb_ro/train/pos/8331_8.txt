this movie is a very relaxed, romantic comedy that is very enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as Albert Einstein's genius granddaughter, though she believes in her skills. Tim Robbins does a job as good as a mechanic who falls in love with her when she enters his shop with her fiance after her car is up. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This movie has a very relaxed feeling, while retaining some kind of seriousness for it (if possible, it happens here). I personally found this movie extremely fun, especially old scientists - I thought they were fab and hilarious! This film seems to have been underestimated beyond the deal. If you have a sense of humor, this movie is for you!
