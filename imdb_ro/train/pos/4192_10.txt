In what will probably happen on my list of Fuller's best films (that is, once I see more of them that it and the Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a noir movie where fatal females like and the male protagonist, are not gender stereotypes. Like all of his works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of New York style, which is usually absent at Hollywood levels. In a small budget - at least for those like Darryl F. Zanuck - Fuller and his actors create characters that are delightful even in such a dark atmosphere. Good boys are, in principle, those who will not be violent with you, even if they are looking for an extra buck. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all wonderful in lead parts. Widmark is just a few actors I can think of who could have retired. It's a bit like Bugs Bunny, because it can be a wise ass that is a little hidden. On the other hand, Skip McCoy's character has a set of values ​​in his life. He does not enter the affairs of others and does not try to care much of the working world outside his small house on the river after being sent for three years. He slips, unknowingly, when he raises a woman (Peters) on the train and raises an object under the eyes of the Government. She may have some secrets that could make a lot of money to her. But what is the cost of the central film because it involves Moe's stool (Ritter is one of the best and most credible actors in the era), the former Kiley of the woman and the police department. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the thematic elements, which are said to be a dramatic, journalistic style (as was Fuller's previous position with the boxer), the dialogue is fresh and implicit. There is a spontaneity in many of Fuller's room movements. And what the third action. This is a thin, thin film that deserves to be checked, even if you are not familiar with Fuller (it's relatively less bizarre than some of his later works).
