A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose business I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive to be real and what is real, and how it can be so difficult to distinguish one from another. He was shot beautifully and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think while I was watching it afterwards.
