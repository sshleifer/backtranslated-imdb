Entering the Seven Pounds, I was not quite sure why to think because the previews were much more open to understand what the movie really was. So, in the first 20 minutes, you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on, and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a stupid one. All this ends when "twisting", so to speak, is unleashed at the last moment of the movie. Practically Tim was disturbed and haunted by a big accident he caused at the end of seven peoples. By doing so, he decides to express seven new people in need of help, who instead give their life. The act of this movie is wonderful, part seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better movies, apart from the eagle eye that I think is there. She was in some bad something good, but she delivers in this movie. Other actors, such as Harrelson wood, have very small roles and do not have a role big enough to understand the character. Although the shooting was still good, this film was not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace in which I was hoping. The film, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything comes into force. Until then, it seems to be a useless love story. The final thought was seven pounds.
