This movie is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, it must be one of the best movies we've seen over time. Jamie Kennedy is amazing, and Loren Dean plays a stray film star very well. And the plot is great. Everything is very real, which is scary. It is said here to be a drama, but this is one of the funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go check.
