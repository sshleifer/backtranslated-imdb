I also saw this at its launch in '56, and have been hit since then with the final stage. If this is a response to "High Night," then it is a fit and appropriate answer. The idea that, as this line points out, "The City Reunites" is a much stronger message than the lone personal heroism of "High Poison". In this theme, "Concho" is a phenomenal precursor of my other favorites, The Magnificent Seven. Both Sinatra and Conrad offer impressive and convincing performances, especially the transformation of Sinatra from the aggressive child's brother to the release of the city's savior. I can only hope that at one point all the friends and family I have caused my affection for this film over the years will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
