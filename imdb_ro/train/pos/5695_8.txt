Some movies manage to survive almost exclusively in originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of these films. The script manages to throw everything in a land near the fever, but without being incoherent. The speed of this thriller should not be chosen to cover a poor scenario, but rather to accurately reflect drug-dependent reality. As a director, James Cox is a very strange way to work his actors. Most characters are always at the edge and often because they are quite ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler, capable of manipulating and controlling. No violation of Kilmer, but his version of Holmes just seems to control his loved ones. However, it is an amazing performance. Comparing this to Kilmer's roles as "Hollywood" as "The Saint," it turns out that he is far more home in brilliant indie films. Actors are the main force that holds all together. There are many small performances that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have a limited screen alongside their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give strange and amazing energy to their roles. We initially stopped viewing "Wonderland" because we assumed it was a movie about a porn star in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but he has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a crime mystery and, as such, is excellent. RATING: 7.5 out of 10
