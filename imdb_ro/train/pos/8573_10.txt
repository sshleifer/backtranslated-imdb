In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by London Metropolitan Police (God bless them) for trying to steal and kill 101 Dalmatian puppies. Everything covered with mud and hay, spent the next 4 years in the "tin box". Four years later she, unfortunately, was released from prison. In 2000, Disney decided to launch a live version of the classic movie and get involved in concerts. called "102 Dalmatians". In it, there is a Dalmatian 102 added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think I should know this because this was just shown on TV recently), and the puppy did not have spots !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted a bigger and better coat - made from chicken again !!!!! I really enjoyed the theme of the song - I'm sure everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70s or so. And now, I heard a little of it in this movie !!!!! "102 Dalmatians" is a wonderful movie, which I'm still wondering - WHEN YOU WILL BE "103 DALMATIIENI" ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
