Now, this is one of Jack Hulbert's best, 1931 best plays, divided into two for Radio Waggon, Askey & Murdoch. He enjoys a great shining cast, who has left the game for everything he deserves, especially Askey, of course. Histrionica was provided by Linden Travers, melodramatic by Herbert Lomas and pragmatic by Richard Murdoch. The group of passengers who gather at the country station alone for the night find more than negotiated for ghost trains, spectral gates, hairy sausages, and Arthur trying to entertain them all. Its restoration all falls between lateral and boring division. When the formula works, it is very good, but sometimes it becomes very controversial and forced to make the film look more dated than it is. But those damn chroniclers - I thank any God that Britain does not have today! Finally, a nice harmless movie to look back on the TV screen like an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shaken off your lumber, you would probably be very disappointed!
