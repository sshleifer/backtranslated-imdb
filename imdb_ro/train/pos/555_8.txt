My comment would have been added to RELEASE DATE, but I could not find a place for that. I was very surprised to see that the movie was released in the US in February 1955. I saw her in a "first-phase" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. I wonder if it was re-launched or a problem? In my opinion, this movie is very easy to entertain but has some classic characters. John McIntyre is doing a job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan practically has the same role he has done in recent years in Red River. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives a good interpretation. I've seen this movie half a dozen or more and never tired of seeing parts of it again. The photo and the landscape are splendid and offer remarkable fun in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
