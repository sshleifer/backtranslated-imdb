This movie is hilarious! I watched her with my friend and we had to see her again. This movie is not for you filming who will only watch the Academy Awards nominated films (you know who you are.) I will not review it because you have seen this from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Beaten" is a light-hearted comedy that made me laugh all the time. Do not take too seriously and should look with your friends, not your girlfriend. He will not win any prize, but he just has to be pursued to be appreciated. True, some jokes are toiletry humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can sometimes use it sometimes. Some people need to be relieved and see "Whipped" for what it is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 of *****.
