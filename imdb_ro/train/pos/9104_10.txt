Well, I do not agree with the other comment posted. Piedras is much better Magnolia or any of the other films that have been mentioned. Especially about unreal characters, I think someone just wrote this just because he never lived in Spanish society, as I did (and I'm not Spanish), it's a real reality movie with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. About being a European film in contrast to an American film, well we have different societies, I personally do not like the modern American films (I like the classic and some of Andy's American films, but there are very few). It's a movie about the continual constitution of a person, we liked or did not all make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
