Well, I would consider the Police as one of Jackie Chan's best movies. The plot, battle scenes and stunts are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions), who successfully arrested a killer. After the murderer was released for lack of evidence, he channeled Chan for killing a police officer. For this reason, he was wanted by the police. Later, Brigitte Lin, the killer's secretary, went to a mall and began stealing the evidence of the murderer's murder from his computer and preparing to send them to Chan. However, the killer knew that Salina downloaded the incriminating data and hired his patrons to capture it. Later, Chan appeared on the stage and began to fight with all the patrons, defeating them one by one. At the last scene, Chan was seen hitting the killer. Ultimately, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone has to look at it. Highly recommended.
