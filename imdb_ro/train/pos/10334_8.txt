I have never seen this movie on TCM and I found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of local cities, just like many other European cities, for example: Norway. World War I ended and the people in this city still suffered from the lost soldiers and the wounded people that the war always creates. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in the city. He was raised a German and was not very pleased with the Polish people and, in turn, did not fully accept him. When Hitler's party came to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for the treatment of him that was really in his mind. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer," played a remarkable role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis have destroyed the families of people and their whole lives. Beef machines are shown in this picture with Jews heading for Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and this topic, give it some time; this movie is very down on the ground for a 1944 movie and a story you will not forget too soon.
