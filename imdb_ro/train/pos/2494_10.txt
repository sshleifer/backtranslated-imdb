The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and they had a drama element in which Bill (mother) struggled with all the usual problems in life, but this element was a little depressing and not mixed well with the comedy elements th, which is probably the reason why he was abandoned. After that, it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC ever did! The chemistry between Bill and Ben was very funny, and in every series there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches. Christmas shows were hilarious and a real Christmas experience. The show ended when the lead actor Gary Olsen who played Bill died who was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in movies like Up 'n' Under and a very funny RIP < This undervalued show has faded from our television screens and must not be repeated many times - although they appear on UKTV Gold from time to time but should be repeated on the BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
