First of all, the feminine leadership is too gorgeous to be missed. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and has a young age. It is always good to review these glorious moments when you see an old Hong Kong school production like this. The film is one of the most influential titles made in the 1980s. Decorating art and other aesthetic facets are all fascinating. More fantastically, the film had a subtle black humor in it. It feels like a horror film, but it is not scared but fun. I had the experience of translating the second scenario of "A Chinese story Ghotst," and I thought the script was a decent thing. However, when I saw the movie, first of all I was disappointed to see the movie different from the script, as on a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. However, it turned out to be better executed in terms of being fun. If you've seen Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities in this movie with LOTR. The climax is like Miranda Otto's mirror struggling with the Witch Ring. It's definitely an out-of-the-way laugh. Bravo!
