German private television is inappropriate for Dutch copying and? naturally? American formats. Well, in Edel & Starck's case, xeroxing went to the basics: Screwball. Can not you sit with a screwdriver comedy? Do not look at Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you still expect a lawyer's drama, similar to the law and its Order, then go elsewhere. (Or look at the Law and Order because it's pretty brilliant to what it does, but I'm approaching.) E & S is funny, it's often funny, romantic, funny, funny and spellbound. > Frankly, I am very astonished that the writers did not receive better deals after the final of the show. And my cynical nature has to be rethought: private German television productions. German residents will understand what they are talking about. In short: Follow it. I do not have the worst English sync, but, hey, it's worth studying German just to watch them for four seasons. Pseudo-happy included.
