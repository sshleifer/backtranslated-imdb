I liked Dan in real life. A wonderful story about travel and love, such as receiving mail or sleeping, but not ridiculous of jokes and jokes, and not so romantic that it makes you want to throw away. Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who does not seem to make things right in his own life. Up to a day, in a family / travel gathering, she meets and connects instantly with Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a filthy filter that returns to the starlet the classic cinema. Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie has to go for a previous commitment and have to break apart. <br /> <br /> Later, we are treated with relatives of Dan's father, who not only have a great breakfast together but also enjoy the use of smart and sweet dorky Dan as the bottom of many jokes. What I liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could have been seen as unpleasant to some, I thought it was a great image of a large family who did not venture into parody or brutal exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close group, lover of people who are genuinely interested in the best for Dan. There are wonderful family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is full of nose, but never means - spirited or gossip; strange, but never unusual. And then Dan falls in love with his brother's friend whom he brought to the family meeting. And so begins a roller-coaster of constrained desire and funny love. <br /> <br /> We could go further, but I thought this movie was simply wonderful. It's not "hip" or "smart", never too full of words and obsessed with dry humor or bites with as many comedies as possible in modern cinema. There is a beautiful balance between stories about stories and funny but real dialogue. In fact, at the beginning of the movie, the initial spark of love begins with a capricious conversation in a classical conversation in Hollywood style where the characters tell what they think aloud. So I probably left and I repeated, but I strongly recommend "Dan in real life." It's a great encounter, believe me, you'll laugh, and if you're a geek like me, you'll have a little eye-catching eye. Filled with magical and fun love, "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Note A
