The adaptable adaptation of the inner monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in the recreation of the bold portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a Celebration Day - Double intentional entender! Director Bravo, screenwriter Haines, as well as the director and stage designer in making this masterpiece. Gunter Grass', the film Tin Drum by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another adaptation of the inner monologic film, which we compare favorably with Strick's film. While there are Dublin landmarks clearly recognized in the original novel and in the film there are also recognized characters, although with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be a major Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film for all of its excellence is even richer by additional views. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
