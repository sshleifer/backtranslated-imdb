Centralized in the city center and Detroit strips, this comedy seemed to me to be a great new comedy duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very funny man who happens to be a Japanese policeman following an industrial secret thief who stole a "proto-tip" super-charger, reluctantly going to the United States to follow thief, after being commanded by his commander. Pat's character collides with Jay Leno's character, a quick talk, but down the Detroit business-policeman. However, when crossing the routes, Honorable "Paths" in Japan meet all forms of Detroit police investigation, "old". The two are hindered and departed first, but then develops a "rhythm" that turns into a two-layer explosive team that solves the case, cold. After struggling with a city crime boss for the stolen "equiptment" and closing the case, they go from mutual contempt to being friends and work together. A little worse for wear and needing a prolonged vacation everywhere, they manage to reach a winning win. I have evaluated this 9. A Lewis direction makes an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it very much. (***)
