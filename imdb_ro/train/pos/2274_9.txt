Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I did not know that. The only reason I looked at him was Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda." But the movie brought me a pleasant surprise. Nolte, of course, was great, but so was the plot. There was not a relatively small political intrigue and a greater focus on the moral question: by reading its anti-Semitic radio commentary with hidden hidden messages to the Americans, it actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turns out late, Americans) to the Jews or Hitler. Who has more weight, his service in his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent, as these words are never spoken, not even as a narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not even open up in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film succeeds. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (such as the White Christmas song) that differentiates it from American films. I recommend it to everyone who gets bored with Hollywood spy movies.
