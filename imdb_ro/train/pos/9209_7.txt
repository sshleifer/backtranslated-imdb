Star Wars: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Mark *** This little bit second ** Going behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is doing it bread in the wild west, when it signals a group of men killing a lady. Being a gentleman, he naturally comes in and stops this, and in this way kills the son of a nasty enforcer. This is just the beginning of a battle with firearms, to the end, of which there will be only one winner. M Dudikoff is an action star who never managed to go with me. Maybe we discovered it too late and after the other movie I've seen with him last month, Shield Human, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have a thing for the Westerners, being movies that just transport me at another time and a different place and offer true escapist entertainment and with this Dudikoff chose one of his better scriptures as his films go anyway. <br /> <The film hits a few low points in the form of a naff native centerpiece, sounding like a witness Marlon Brando and generally singing from a cast along with the mandatory sets of cheap looks. But if, for a strange reason, your life has ever been dependent on watching a Dudikoff movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
