There are very few movies that are as fun as this one. I was fortunate enough to watch this movie at a "reserved" theater for movie lovers like me so it was not so embarrassing to sit there laughing until my jaw was completely inflamed and my sleeves were wet Drying the eyes ... Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but that's maybe for the best - a little rest during the run between the corridors (almost I fell from the chair. ..) was very welcome.
