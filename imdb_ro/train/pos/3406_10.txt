In terms of visual beauty this movie is remarkable! I had no idea Technicolor came out so early. Although I did not like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want to be in North Africa. The distribution is excellent, and Marlene Dietrich is a great addition and of course it's appealing and I just loved it in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not go over landscapes and sets ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, everything is there ... legionnaires also bring a feeling "Beau Geste" to the movie. They certainly do not make such movies. Do not miss this classic!
