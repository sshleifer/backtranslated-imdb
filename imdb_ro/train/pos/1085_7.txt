This movie was a funny comedy about the fact that Murphy's Law was applied to the owner and the construction. If such a movie was made today, no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was established in the "simpler" forty, we get what should be a typical family of the era. Grant, of course, combines perfectly comedy and dramatic elements and works with a more than competent support distribution, emphasized by Loy and Douglas. Their Shenanians make a solid ninety minutes fun, 7/10.
