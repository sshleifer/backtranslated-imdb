This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I saw it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features or even a menu, but that's not necessarily what I care. I tend to judge films on a case-by-case basis, depending on, among other things, whether it is a large studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. Having said that, I think it has one of the most imaginative and original headlines we've seen. I liked the action of all the great players. I was especially delighted with Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most funny lines. The character played by Claire Forlani might happen to be unrealistic for some people, but I personally met real people with emotional problems who are very easy to look at the decisions of life, as her character does. This helped me pick up the nuances that her hurt could come through her veneer of humor. It's not a movie for kids, obviously, but it does NOT engage in free sex and nudity. There is enough language for adults, but sometimes it can be very funny. (Especially the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly). Also, watch for known actors.
