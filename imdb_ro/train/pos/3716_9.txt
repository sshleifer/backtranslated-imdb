I was treated to a Cracker Bag view last night before a Disney preview preview. I do not know who decided to show her, but I'm very glad they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute jewel, a snapshot of Australia in the early 1980s, seen through a child's eye. "The conversations" between Eddie and her brother were hilarious and, just like in the rest of the movie, so true to life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, because it reminded me of my childhood (at the same age as the director, probably helps a little bit) and the audio has multiplied the feeling. I just hope I'll see Cracker Bag again a day.
