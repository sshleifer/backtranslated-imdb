THE FOUR MAN (Paul Verhoeven - The Netherlands 1983). A film based on a novel by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising given that Reve needs about a hundred pages for a minor plot of plot, and tension is the last thing I think when I read it. "The Fourth Man." Paul Verhoeven is generally very preoccupied with proving some largely hostile critics and I am never sure what he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such a desperate way, deviates quickly from the original idea or story and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on the screen and what needs to be left. In "The Fourth Man," he is not so explicit in detailing the plot, as it is with sex and nudity (of which there is a lot), but, like most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the audience does not he will get and knock at home the story with symbolism apparently mixed with nudity and allegedly shocking sex scenes. There is almost no sexless scene or full frontal nudity, mostly so unpleasant, and in front of you, it undermines a good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can deal with Verhoeven's fairly satirical approach, it's a thriller of entertainment sometimes with some intriguing plot and good performances, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen KrabbÃ©. > <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
