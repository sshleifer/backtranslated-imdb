Kurosawa weaves a story that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and the act is true for the story, each star playing their part as part of the larger story. It's exciting, fun and intriguing in all directions. The character's development is almost perfect, the cinema is alive and engaged, and the story attracts you. I would like to say that the "strange samurai" and those obsessed with the dynasties of the 18th and 19th centuries Japan's stories can destroy this film as Kurosawa's best work. Maybe it's not the best, but even worse, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based both on lifting the human life of ordinary people in a period of great change, that it is timeless, despite being put into the past far too distant. to any film, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
