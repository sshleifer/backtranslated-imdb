I caught this movie late one night / Sunday morning with my brother. I drank. This is one of the best fun movies I've ever seen. From the "luxury" floating line, in fact, a "zipper", complete with cast iron, everything at the doors with adhesive stickers, personally saying, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - !! Continuity is so poor that you can not help, but notice it, pushing you in front of the holes. In the final scene he jumps from a ferry boat in the distance. Cut off his new son and girlfriend (the kung-fu ship director of the PR who was in the police but was fired for doing things the way he is) on a ferry that goes very quickly by the blast. ... Then the father hugged them. How???? Who cares, his magic. There is no redeeming feature for this movie. The casino has the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. when they are being watched by evildoers, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under Table One, continue to shoot four fruit machines and a small corner (a corner in the casino - fantastic). They walk directly over the single hiding place, allowing Casper to approach them and take them out. Get some colleagues, get some drinks, put this movie and scream.
