Viggo Mortensen plays the role of a new prisoner in a haunted prison where the guard (played well by Lane Smith) has a terrible secret that might be the reason why different guards and detainees are killed by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the one who knows the secret and is scared of his life. When I think of prison movies, I always think of action movies with Stallone or Van Damme or high-caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a ghost story on the Exorcist III line. But prison is an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is creepy and has a good action from a cast of (unknown). Lane Smith is best off because his director is not the usual clich√© of the bad person, but rather nervous and offensive, which adds a certain credibility to a movie that goes far beyond expectations. *** of 4- (Good)
