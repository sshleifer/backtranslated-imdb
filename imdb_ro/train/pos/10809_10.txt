Russell, my fav, is great in this movie. But more than that, the film covers an extraordinary range of passion and human sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is approached and respected. The film makes the viewer understand that the tolerance of other people offers the way to saving mankind. A fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I play back their scenes again and again. Anyone who has ever been in love will feel empathetic with these people. All the characters are excellently portrayed and portrayed.
