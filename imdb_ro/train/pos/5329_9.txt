This movie was great. The terrain was absurd. Sequences of action contrived. But, provided you can light enough to laugh, it was an extremely thrilling story combining Keystone Policies and Lone Ranges. Badies were worse than bad. The good boys were not good. Black actors played normal characters, rather than black stereotypes. Inclusion of a child brought a good note. Sympathy could have been a bit more difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with the actor. It was, overall, very good. I really wanted to put Judge Reinhold. And, after all, is not that sign of a very good film that wanted to put Judge Reinhold in?
