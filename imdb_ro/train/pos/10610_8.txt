A young man with a past tristes (Henry Thomas) comes to a girl abandoned in the woods and falls in love with her immediately. The elders of the city generally support them in preserving the child, although a local temptation (Cara Seymour) does not believe much about the new family. A determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister vendor traveling (David Strathairn at the most creepy) have parallel stories that convert in a fake way. This is a charming slice of life in Ozarks in the same sense as "Where The Lillies Bloom" & "The Dollmaker". All three were shot down in those beautiful hills and covered the lives of ordinary people who live simple but not very simple. A minimum of strong language and short violence, but that's what makes this family view pretty safe.
