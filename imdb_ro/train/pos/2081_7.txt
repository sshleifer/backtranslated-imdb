He watched 8/29/2009 - 7 of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well told the story of China's farmers and their rise to prominence and battles with what mother nature throws to them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the marriage arranged by a son with a slave girl. The film does a good job of maintaining your interest, despite a somewhat strange performance by Paul Muni's leadership. Chronicles, Wong Long (the character played by Muni), and how the land works, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the country where it originally began. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main subject of the story (besides the earth itself) and, despite the obvious and non-Chinese actors, does a good job of displaying the country and its people. It is obvious that MGM used the money to create a very good epic with him at a time when he might have been able to afford it. The grasshopper scene is doing very well and the rest of the movie looks really good, guaranteeing the Oscar Best Cinematography Award that year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it is extracted quite well.
