Well, I'm not saying a lie, it's not really the best movie of all time, but it's a very nice movie that no one has ever seen. It's a girlfriend's police film with Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi), with a story about the whistle of a missing car prototype or something, but that does not matter. the reason this movie is fun is due to the interaction between the two leaders who originally disliked and did not trust, but in a shocking twist of fate they became friends. The whole issue of culture is doing pretty well, because it's fun to look at, it's totally ridiculous, but in a weird and pleasant way. The soundtrack is cold again in a kind of cheese, it's right for the movie, I've been trying to find one of the songs over the years, but how do I work from remembering what I think the words were seemed to find him. Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay of any movie ever, but I will not give it up, oh no! In conclusion, I would make this film over 48 hours - most of Eddie Murphys' exit, including the Beverly Hills policeman, and anyone named Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence. If you are looking for a friend's movie movie and you are used to "White White Police Officer meets zany streetwise black cop" this gives a kick. You may be pleasantly surprised because this turns the whole formula upside down with "the Japanese policeman met with white zany streetwise white cop". I give this 7. to be honest I like more than that. I would rather look at this than the many things I would give 8. But I think I know deeply that it's kind of crazy that makes me make this movie.
