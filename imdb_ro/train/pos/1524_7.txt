This movie is a classic should be. It's not perfect, for sure. Pacing, while being perfect for the scene, is in slow cinematic form as a cruciform knee with arthritic knee. Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. She fully demonstrates enough talent, talent and craft to convincingly play Joan, smart, passionate and confident, but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game the dialogue was clearer, nor the more musical lines. However, processing this movie requires you to look at it as a lawyer. This movie is a case, and the spectator is the judge. This is how you can enjoy this image. 7/10.
