I saw this first as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitler's Luftwaffe were too obvious, and the landscape of the film remembered the street. I remember having nightmares after I saw him. The odd thing is, indeed, that it has not been given to be regarded as a piece of social history in cinematography. <br /> <br /> In addition to a destructive war globally, the ladder of the machines was very bad, more Nano-Technology now, but overall, a great work well done. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived. I think the burning of a spacecraft from a giant track would surely kill astronauts. However, many were right. Man's desire for war, man's inhumanity to man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
