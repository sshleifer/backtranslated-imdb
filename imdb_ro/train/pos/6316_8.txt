This is not a "wandering", but a precise and faithful remake of Monicelli, "I Soliti Ignoti" of 1958, with Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that is why it is good to copy all the characters fun and plot, even in details (such as the scene where the photographer steals the room from the local market) .I saw the old version several times and I knew on the one hand all the gangs and the end, but I still enjoying "Welcome to Collinwood," which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the lives and ways of the tiny thieves in Italy in the 1950s for the US in 2002 have been adapted. / 10.
