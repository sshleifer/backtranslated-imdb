So I rented "Still Crazy". When I described the Hardcore Logo to the video store guy, he said it sounds like Crazy still. So I rented it. I was disappointed? Well, yes, while Still Crazy focuses more on a classical rock band than on a punk band, but it's okay. Crazy Style tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that split up in the '70s at the peak of their popularity at a great rock festival. Twenty years later, band members struggle to win their existence and are offered the opportunity to play for the 20th anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to reform permanently, making the tour of Europe in this process. There are some pretty funny quirks, and all the characters go through subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a spectator of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
