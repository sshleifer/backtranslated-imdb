Destined letters end in another world found in the rooms behind the post office. Here, Alice manages to land a job in the hope of finding her lost father. What she discovers is her tormented soul, Frank. A small Aussie camouflage who came and went to the cinema. Now you can find it in the dark corner of the video store, shaded by fifty copies of the dreaded GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because it turned out to be a satisfying film, telling a brave story with simple, powerful images and effective performance from the two leaders. This film succeeds when other employees of Garry Marshall, who died, did not succeed, and did not come close to the brilliance of the turkey Kevin Costner, but to the postman of He Jianjun (1995 - China).
