Nice film, though I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie, to know why Elly is such a lie. Then, when we finally get an explanation that returns to her childhood, there is still not much detail. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something like that. Anyway, it's still a good movie that I would look again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
