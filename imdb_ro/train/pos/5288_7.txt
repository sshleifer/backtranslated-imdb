This funny cartoon Bugs Bunny sees the return of Marvin Martian and K-9, who has not yet been named, the green dog. This time, instead of trying to destroy the Earth, Marvin is on a landing mission, you capture a creature of the Earth and take it back to Mars. Of course, the creature she chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are tricks or treatments, but realizes that this can not be right when Marvin drastically raises his Bug rabbit hole with a gun. The bugs are trying to cheat the situation in two ways, including Marvin's conviction that the K-9 is planning a revolt. Eventually, he is captured using a tight Acme Jacket that pulls out the bazooka. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it acts as advertising, and Bug's is forced to use its intelligence to release the K-9, the tables are back soon and the two dissatisfied Martians are enslaved and the Bugs are trying to Fly the plate back to Earth. I really enjoyed this, though the end is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed easily here and he becomes visibly emotional when he's upset, but that did not make me like him or the cartoon less.
