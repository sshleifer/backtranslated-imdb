After I saw "Break a Leg" in Vancouver, at the launch party I thought it was a very nice movie. I had some belly rashes and a few cameos (especially Eric Roberts) were screamed. I did not hear a word about the actual launch date, although I heard it was close. The story is simple, but it's mainly a vehicle for characters and situations. The script is smooth and smooth, the script develops effortlessly and the act is comfortable but fresh. This film has won at least one prize from each of the film festivals in which it was in, which is around 10-15 or so. I strongly recommend "Break a Leg".
