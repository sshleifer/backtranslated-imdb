Just mention another thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the evaluations that make this one of Errol Flynn's biggest excursions in a great field tour. I think that the role played by boxer Jim Corbett is more like his true personality than the one he was printed on. Flynn seemed a party animal in his memoirs, and he was a type whose reality was more interesting than the life of the screen. What I wanted to emphasize is to observe the fittings, transitions and inserts that make the film's score. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent collaborator of Flynn, along with Sid Hickox cinema, the editions were made up of an up-to-date editor named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel went so far, but it's listed in credits. He will go on to a great career as director of action himself.
