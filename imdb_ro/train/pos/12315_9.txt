There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is just no criticism. This is because this movie is awesome fun and has little of everything in it. It's maybe a little frightening for younger children, but my 15-year-old thought she was fantastic in all respects from action, humor and even beautiful musical scores. I buy DVDs only when they know they will be seen on a regular basis and now that this is finally available in the UK, add it to my collection.
