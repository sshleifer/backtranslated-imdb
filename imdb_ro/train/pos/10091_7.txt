We first watched the Elephant Walk in about 30 years and was hit by how similar the story line is to the very high "Rebecca". As the others have said, you have a sweet young man falling from your feet by the charming and hungry alternate master of the mansion just to find his marriage threatened by the inevitable memory of a bigger relative than life but deeply erroneous. You have the severe and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind the couple together or irreparably destroy them, culminating in the terrible destruction of the generous household. Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes from the jarring atmosphere of the jungle to the Letter, the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore plant rather than a Sri Lanka tea plantation. Maltin offers "Elephant Walk" just two stars and IMDb readers are not much better, but I liked it despite the predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looks prettier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as a virtually good man, unable to escape his arrogant father's influence. Dana Andrews - favorite in "Laura" and "Best Year of Our Life" - is wasted like Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful sets of interior in the history of the film.
