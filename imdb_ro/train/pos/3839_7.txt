Most people know Paul Verhoeven as director of many SF films in Hollywood. But, long before, it was released in generic thrillers in her native country. The story is a fundamental premise for fatal females, nothing new or enthusiastic. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of dream sequences that, instead of defining our main character and situation, are just used as a way to lead the predictable plot forward. The script was solid, the dialogue contributing to mitigating the effects of the gentle storyline. What really made the movie at least good was a terrible show. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the "tortured artist," and the supporters were very good. Also, Jan De Bont's cinema adds at least a little life to the movie, helping Verhoeven to be at least as director. 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * 1/2 / * * * *
