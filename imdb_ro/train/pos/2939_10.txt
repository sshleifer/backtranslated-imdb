Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever - perhaps the most funny. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I watched this movie hundreds of times, and every time I see it - I have some later fun. This is certainly one for your video library. It guarantees you have to watch it several times to hear all the jokes because you will laugh so much - that you will lose half of them! Delirious is hilarious! Although there are a lot of fun comedians there - after watching this stand-up comedy, most will look like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - take it, look at it - and you will love it! It will do you better! :-)
