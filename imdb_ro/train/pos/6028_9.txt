This is Antonioni's middle-time film, which most critics reject as a "defective" look at the youth culture / politics of the 1960s. For what it deserves, I found it more moving and memorable than its more popular films, such as L'AVVENTURA, probably because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture, and the whole anti-constitutional, anti-war reaction that was so prominent at the time. <br /> <br /> Even technically pure, it's a remarkable film; from the opening of credit success to the bizarre love-in desert, the use of billboards, and even to that ending head that uses 17 sets of cameras (in its way as powerful as the highlight of The Wild Bunch). Antonioni also chose a hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful to ever grab the screen. This is not a lot of "acting", because this is more like a documentary drama, so the use of non-professional as a leader pair works quite efficiently in this context. And the soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, it's also impressive for its use (I can not forget the beginning of the movie, especially because of the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - which magnifies the images so well). <br /> Unlike popular opinion, this is a pretty good cinematic achievement, and one would enthusiastically recommend anyone with a taste or tolerance for off-beat. Well, worth looking, and one of those key movies of the 1960s that require a DVD / launch restoration.
