I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I really liked the movie. Two days before the premiere of the movie, I went to see her concert. I saw the trailer and the movie "kite" before the movie and I thought I had everything I realized ... I was wrong: Instead of a good movie I witnessed a great one! I FELT the movie. it was sad .. it was fun .. but most imagined LOVE .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so i will not :) I'm not a film critic .. I can describe it with more words .. My pretty description is everything because the song left me speechless .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and thank you TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
