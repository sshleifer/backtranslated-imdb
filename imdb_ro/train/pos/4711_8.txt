What fun is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a talent for comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here he seems to have told the actors to come out and have fun. Micheal Keaton braves Johnny as his best performance. Joe Piscopo is awesome as Danny Vermin, what the directors of shame did not do about it. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the unique vocabulary of the character. I do not think it's an accident that most of his character's name is written MORON. Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines. Even minor role actors, such as Dick Butkus and Alan Hale, fall in love. We recommend a friend.
