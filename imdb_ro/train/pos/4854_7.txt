Push him in a dark and stormy night and prepare to be amused, irritated and scared. The old noise about a ghost train that is said to go through the lone English country at night's death can be unlikely, but it's really fun. There are some wonderful old cliques such as the "ACCIDENT" that locals can remember, but they will not talk about. But first of all, the film is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to exhibit his special brand of humor in the vaudeville style, between scary bits. Askey's humor is not very trendy these days, but if you let it wash over you, it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's movies.
