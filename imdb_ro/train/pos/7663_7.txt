As a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I gave her a shot. Not bad. Not great, but that's different. The film involves a struggle with a mystical "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and the world's authorities, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and finds a comrade guarding a fortress; however, the guard was blinded. His eyes are ruined holes. So the wizard passes his hands over the eyes of the other, and hey, presto! His eyes were restored! This type of healing seems to work only with the eyes. Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a battle museum. Think about what you win. However, in part, the picture is not bad at all, although it is like a comic book. Dr. Mordred several "human" adventures are fine, and Combs plays the compelling role. I've seen much worse.
