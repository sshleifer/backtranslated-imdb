This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol looked very nice. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is an actor born and will grow very much in the near future. The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a way you are left unhappy, but if you really think in real terms, you realize that the only reasonable end was the end of the movie. Otherwise, it would have been a great injustice to everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who meets a girl waiting to marry in court. Her boyfriend does not appear and ends with the witness. Slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is unclear whether he has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for full details. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is pretty, but he did not talk much in the movie. Her eyes, her innocence made most of the speech.
