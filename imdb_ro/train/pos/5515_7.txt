I read a little about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, it was a real hero for the people, because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and hated what oppressive forces had done on his people like and all the other Latin Americans in general! Now, I do not know about others, but for me she did what she had to do if she wanted socialism, so everyone had to pay their fair share. However, the strong elite obviously was not going to go for it. So, rather than understand what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work because there were too many of its other followers who took only the place they left. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As for me, and as Che told them before she died: "If you kill me, it's good, but you kill only one man, you will not kill the cause!" But I could not have said better. But ... EVERYBODY ... that's why I give this movie 7 out of 10.
