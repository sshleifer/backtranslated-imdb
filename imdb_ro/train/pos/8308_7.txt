It fits into a musical Sunday to get your heart pumping and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers from ladies and defined rock and roll. Look at Leon to give a definitive characterization, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Story of Alan Freed. This was a fascinating biopic when I saw Little Richard struggling with his father, his church and himself with whom he was. He won the battle and there is no one else to have his voice or his style.
