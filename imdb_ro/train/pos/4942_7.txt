I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I've lost practically. It was a slightly funny humor, but in the best case a boschet plot and a general sense of futility that was about to make me think I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized I was enjoying it. There is no orbit of realization and no sudden dramatic scene that catches me. In fact, nothing really interesting happens in the whole movie. It was as if we suddenly realized that the movie was meant to be largely useless - and that its uselessness was his charm. Morgan Freeman played as an undefined actor who finds a "small project" to start his career. He will play a supermarket manager and spend the day at a supermarket in the neighborhood to investigate his role. While he meets and talks to Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more of life. It helps him prepare for an interview as if he is listening for a role while introducing him into real life. It's really fun to see him (because that is the character identified in credits) to be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. Freeman and Vega were awesome together, with a weird but completely credible wise of romantic combined chemistry, but father-daughter. If you feel lost at first, stay with this. In the end, it seems to be a delightful movie of delight. 7/10
