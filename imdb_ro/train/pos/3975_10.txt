If you lived in the 1960s, this movie can sometimes be painful and sometimes quite joyous. Everything is there, but the little pattern in the taboos of the predominant counter-culture at that time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing: "Do not talk too fast for the wheel that is still moving, for the times where it changes." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its diffusion at that time, it has played an extraordinary hand on the evolution of intelligence, influencing engineers, scientists, and helping to hyper-develop computer-related activities. A greeting to the directors from someone who was there - you captured the era better than I saw before.
