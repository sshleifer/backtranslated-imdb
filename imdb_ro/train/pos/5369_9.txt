In the near future, Arnold plays Ben Richards, a man wrongly convicted, forced to play "The Running Man," a deadly television show in which people must continue to move to try to escape brutal deaths in their hands "Stalker". Of course, people are expected to eventually die to Arnold to prove that the system is wrong. I have not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great, indifferent film, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the role of the man of action, leading to death with an unforgettable ship. The classics are probably "It was a real sore throat," after strangling a guy with a barb and "She had to break up!" Referring to the place where he left someone vertically. Dawson is very irritated as the TV presenter, and all "Stalkers" are properly camped. The action is violent, but it's a action movie. That's the point. The movie is fast, and does not exceed its welcome time at 90 minutes. With Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch at the helm and made after the success of The Terminator, this movie was previously considered another mindless action vehicle for Arnold and very late. But today, anyone who looks at a lot of television can see how the reality film is coming. I would not be surprised to start the TV in the "near future" and see a show that is not far from that. In that depressing note, I must still recommend "The Running Man" to anyone who likes 80, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
