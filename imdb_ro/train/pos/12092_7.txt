I remember the first time that I saw her back in the '70s when she was featured on the late television. It scared the fuck. But then, I was a teenager in those times, not like movies like now. CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of Mario Caiano's Italian horror genre of the 1960s and Mario Caia's CASTLE NIGHTMARE (1965), along with Mario Bava, BLACK NIGHT (1960), DEATH COURSES LIFE (1966). If you want a frightening atmosphere with extraordinary writing, check them too. I also evaluate them with Poe's early films, which Roger Corman was doing at the same time. I saw the new DVD Synapse that was taken from a French print and is a great improvement over that old tray - and print scanning that has been touring on TV over the years. Add a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that does not add too much to the movie as a whole, but it's nice to see it completely without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD really does not offer any extras beyond the photos in the movie. A flub that I noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke effect man near the room reflecting on the front door of the inn. I think publishers did not catch it at that time, or maybe they did not care, but it's something I did not notice for the first time. These are the wonders of the DVD. You can see all the flaws, mistakes and details that were not obvious for the first time. But it does not matter. But indifferent, it still has a 7 per meter imdb <br /> <br />
