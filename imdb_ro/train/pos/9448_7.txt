This was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The first part of the movie, though weird, is of a mild and fun quality. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and highlighting the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But this is misleading beyond faith. Obvious social problems (crossing) and distortions of rural residents are just the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning about pain and I wake up. Lewis's leg made me stray. However, while the film was generally very disturbing and distracting, he asked some interesting questions. When is it moral or the right to take the life of another person? What can or can not lead our morality in some cases? And moral integrity and dignity are more important than life itself? Regardless of the conclusions he can draw from the film, it is a stand-alone achievement (despite some aspects that were real and dreadful).
