This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric illnesses among aging today. As one who has encountered a number of families who are experiencing Alzheimer's or who are in the training stage, I would suggest that each health care provider recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and reach the heart of the fight. Casting is excellent and dramatic portraiture is remarkable, with a very commanding plot line.
