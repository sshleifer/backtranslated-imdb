"Roman Troy Moronie" is my commentary on the film. What else can be said? <br /> <br /> This character really takes the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster, incapable of pronouncing profane words, seems to have been frustrating to be hard and yet not to be able to express yourself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will descend into the annals of film history as one of the greatest of all deaths. There is, of course, a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. I like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an "R" rating because it could not pronounce profanity.
