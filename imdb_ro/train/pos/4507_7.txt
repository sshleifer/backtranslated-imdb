I was really amazed how much a movie, over 60, can impress me. It's almost two hours, there's absolutely no star in it, there are subtitles, but it's still interesting and interesting to watch. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You almost felt the cold of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a world of CGI like today. I was wondering how much it should have been for van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Who wants to talk about Titanic now? It's a great movie with a wonderful message, and I would recommend to future directors how big and realistic the movies can be if they're only aimed at realism instead of visual effects.
