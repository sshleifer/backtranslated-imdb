This film is such a kindness cheese. A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. They're getting killed, I know they're being watched, so what do they do? A girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat her husband (who is also there) with an old lover to find some kind of bed (in an old abandoned school?) And to go at him. /> And comes with gore and T & A. And it is also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. If the 80-year-old slack is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people or when Hollywood views target the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a British movie made to be an American slammer. It's hilarious to see how often British actors trying to talk "American" slip unintentionally back to their accents in the UK. If you like cheesecake slasher 80 (such as pieces) then you will like this.
