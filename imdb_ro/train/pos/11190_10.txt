One of Stephen King's best screenings, if not the best. Darkness like darkness can be, surprisingly, the end of the non-Hollywood, a frightening atmosphere, amazing adaptation of the book, exceptional expression, education (not playing with the afterlife), in short - everything should be a great horror ... /> <br /> My favorite horror movie, right 10+.
