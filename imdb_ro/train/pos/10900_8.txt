This was a documentary for me when I lost my chance in 2004, so I was certainly thinking about repeating. I really felt the main character of the film, because it is true, I have a fur coat condition of her skin problem, epidermolysis bullous dystrophic (EB). This is a sad, sometimes funny, and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks as a child (due to loss of vocal muscles) and has never passed through puberty but is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see their terrible condition and remove their bandages. Jonny had a rather naughty sense of humor, even the story beyond the tomb when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells the story with his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. He won BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Director (Factual) and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 on "The 100 largest TVs treated". You have to see the documentary!
