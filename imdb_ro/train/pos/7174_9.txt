We went from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see the premiere of this movie - and I really enjoyed doing it. As a great film fan and a Nordic Californian throughout my life, I was surprised how many Oscar winning films were made in the Bay area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay area, unlike going to LA, George Lucas's comments on persistence, community and vision really resonated with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other directors can do it in SF, so can other artists. <br /> <br /> It would have recommended this movie
