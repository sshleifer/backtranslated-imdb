Now I've always been a fan of puppet work at Full Moon. But I have to say Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yeah, you heard me. The story works great, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first-rate job. Gary Graham, who really gets his footprint on television on shows like Alien Nation Serial and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows he can be a star of action that hits the ass and takes his name. The effects of the stop motion could have been a bit better. The color was wrong, it sounds plastic instead of the metal it should have been. But this is a minor complaint compared to the entire Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies then you enjoy this movie. 9 STEPS OF 10.
