What a thrill ride! Turn and challenge. Again, Sharon Stone takes away the impeccable spontaneity of writer Catherine Tramell. The original base instinct takes place in San Francisco. The continuation takes place in London, where Catherine moved now. Both lively cities, known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to take his residence. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the unclear role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis starred as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing journey from Lupine to the Harry Potter series. Gentle vehicles, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, - all "basic instincts". The mind bends. Great scenario. From the scene of the opening climate to the end of the surprise, this movie is nothing but boring! Everybody in the theater was stuck on the screen.
