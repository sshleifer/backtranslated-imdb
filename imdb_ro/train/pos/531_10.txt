This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this film for the first time a week ago, every day I see the opening and every time I feel so excited as I felt the first time I heard David Niven telling the immortal words from Sir Walter's Pilgrimage Raleigh: <br /> <br /> Give me the spit rope, my peace, my faithfulness of faith, my hand of joy, the immortal diet, my salvation glass, my dress of glory, And so I will take The Pilgrimage (?) Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are well justified because they made such a wonderful opening? Because they have already been admitted to the poet's Paradise long before making this film. I imagine they both face the trial during Doomsday and say unconditionally to an ugly God: Please, forgive me, sir. So you want to know what we did during our lives? Well, you will see well: I have written and directed: I know where I am going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes? Do you think that long enough? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty to God, Nature Music or whatever you might call when they shot a matter of life and death. The fact that the lives of others are justified for their deeds can not be obvious to everyone, despite the fact that I feel that my life would make sense if I had done nothing else to see this movie. the elders will be tempted to say: I do not make movies like this. They will be partly wrong; they did not make movies like this in the past. I have already quoted Keats here, but I will repeat his words: One thing of beauty is joy forever.
