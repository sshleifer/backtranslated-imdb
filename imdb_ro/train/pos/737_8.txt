It is amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, fan 1 of Ramones rock punk rock in Rock 'n' Roll High School. The sole is so exuberant, it does not bother you that it is obviously too old to stay in high school (this fact is equaled by the fact that all children have a look 24). The film is a fast-paced frolic that does not take place; everything gets blown to confusion at the end, and as it should be. Mary Woronov, a strange and strange presence as a Nazi commander, receives a wonderful start, in which Frisbees is flying dangerously close to the head (how many wells did she use or was a fluke?), And Dey Young is very appealing to her role to Soles, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, quite ironic, in this high school band is Ramones. They can not act, they are not funny, and their concert section takes too long. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around," is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, especially a rare ballad about Paul McCartney, heard from the beginning ("Have we met somewhere before?"). Big fun! *** from ****
