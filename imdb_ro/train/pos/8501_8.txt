I think it is a very good example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a great movie to show up in a class of sociology. I thought it was quite funny and I have to say that I am a sucker because "it allows the body together and do its job." It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It also has some dramatic elements in it and I think it mixes well. On the whole, I give it a solid 8.
