Words can not describe it hard, so I'll be short. "Thief of Baghdad" was my favorite movie as a child and never ceased to amaze or delight me. I liked this movie from the first moment I saw it when I was a six-year-old boy who had begun to read "Arab nights." I remember walking into the television room in the midst of Sabu's fight with the huge spider and being instantly comforted. He rarely has so much beauty, magic and wonder that he was captured on the film. Sabu and John Justin are gorgeous as heroes, Conrad Veidt is not delightful as the evil Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to look like a sardonic genius. Georges Perinal's photo is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of three directors is Michael Powell, a director who was welcomed by critics, but is often forgotten by his audience for his remarkable films, including "A Matter of Life and Death" and " He is one of the true masters of the room, right there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles, and as with all the great works of art, the beauty of "Thief of Baghdad" is in detail, each frame has its own charm magic The story never delays, and their characters and actions always involve, it's a movie that never grows old.
