This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but this is a movie that has been done to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are brought with a variety of talented actors and who understand this sport. The plan was credible and I like the message. William Dear and the boys together put together a wonderful movie. Most sports movies are spinning around real stories or events and often do not work well. But this film reaches a perfect 10 scale, even though there have been some minor mistakes here and there.
