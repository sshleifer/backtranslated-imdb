I remember seeing this on television at the end of the '70s - and stayed with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great movie for kids. I put it for some friends at a party lately - and of course they thought I was upset and we were expecting something bad to happen to the puppets "meet the weak." But not - his healthy fun. <br /> </ strong> Wild Jack is in fine shape, just like the cassy mum and the witch latch somewhat appealing. If you like banana disagreements and you are in the thirties, this will again create this surreal childhood on the morning of Saturday vibe! Even if I realized now that Puf himself is a little bad - all he does is get caught and run! Quality TV movie - if you, like me, are in death metal - you will like it!
