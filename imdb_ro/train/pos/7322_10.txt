Halloween is one of those movies that deepens your skin! It is, in my opinion, the most frightening film of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there are no special effects in which you can tell how animated the computer is, it was at a low budget and had a score, but it managed to scare Hell of people. 25 years old and this film still has the same effect as in the year 78. It's a boy Michael Myers, kills his sister at the age of six, and many years later he escapes from the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do everything he will bring back because he describes Michael as "... the evil evil, the darkest eyes, the Devil's eyes." Michael is on a mission, however, to kill another sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She needs to feed at Halloween, while her friends go to the party and, of course, we know the rules, they do it! But Laurie might have a chance since she's a virgin. D Halloween pays tribute to Psycho, we have another character called Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely awesome movie that breaks the borders and makes you close the doors, close your windows and turn off the lights! "He'll get you, he'll take you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br />
