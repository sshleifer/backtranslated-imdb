This is a very strange movie - and that is NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless story and a fairy tale. I'm sure some might find this movie too weird, but I liked it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful distribution of ordinary people (not actors) and has a great overall performance. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point - this happens in a very absurd way. Ignore the special effects of cheese - after all, it was made in the early 1950s and special effects are not terribly important anyway (or at least should not be in movies). Instead, stay short and enjoy the very strange and bad walk. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you will have a ball. By the way, ever since I first reviewed this movie, I saw another DeSica directed film, which is absolutely must-see and who is CHILDREN WILL SPEAK US. While it's not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, a wonderful movie, though.
