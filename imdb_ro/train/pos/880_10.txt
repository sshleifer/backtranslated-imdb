Probably the best movie of the year for me. This small French film focuses on engagement of the Secretary Office Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends his days in the service of other men unreliable, the source of their contempt and conversation lunch is too clear for it, partially deaf read lips. A change is set in motion when hires new password Paul (Vincent Cassel) as an assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. The mutual relationship, for very different reasons, binds them. Carla gets attracted to Paul and makes her feel attractive for what she seems to be the first time. Paul does nothing to scatter his feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and form a plan to steal from him, which will involve Carlas his ability to read lips. I think the main thing that pushes the film over an average suspense / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the entire movie, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing connection between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (won the French Caesar for Best Actress). You never feel like watching a piece of acting, that's Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. It makes a somewhat untouched character, both appealing and appealing. I liked this film because these two men, and both times when I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to cinema and to get involved in everything.
