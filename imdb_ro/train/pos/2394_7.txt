Nice, pleasant and funny, but not scattered by the earth. It does a good job of showing the world "behind the scenes" of the theater groups and actors' lives. The three witches are great - both on stage and on stage. I would assume that the movie works great (a lot of jokes appearing inside) if someone was involved in the theater (which is not me).
