Big movie of Broadway music spirits. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to throw dice and organize illegal games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he drops craps. He decides on the final match when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets big, is in the city. He makes Sky that he can not get Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him in Havana. This may sound like a strange abstract summary, but so is the movie! This is a real mixed bag - there are wonderful things here. The songs are good and the dance is incredible. The real stop for the show is at the end of the game. Brando is also really good here - it would seem weird to think of him singing and dancing, but he pulls it off. I have to admit to seeing the great and bulky Brando who have pulled some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! Sinatra is also pretty good and Blaine is just great as her long-suffering girlfriend. Its numbers of songs and dancing are highlighted here. Now for bad songs - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she is stuck in a colorless and colorless role and can not do much with her. The movie is too long to 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons are really shooting and should have been shortened. Also, most characters speak very accurately in English - contractions are never used. Maybe he's trying to be funny out of the mouths of gangsters, but I realized he was bothering me and continued to throw me out of the movie. It's worth catching the songs and the dances, but its length comes to you after a while. I give her a 7.
