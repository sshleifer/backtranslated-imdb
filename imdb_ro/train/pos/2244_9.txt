The only explanation I can understand why this film is not widely distributed is because it hurts too much from home for some. This movie was a real happy surprise, satire is a genius. This film transforms the lights into darkness, which is organized religion and large media, and the cocks twist for cover. Rent the DVD and watch it alone, if you have not done it yet, this movie succeeds where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to beat their nose under the tent, using both humor and analogies very smart coupled with backgrounds and locations. I can not comment in depth without revealing significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this movie, which even the film with spicy film will be caught on guard.
