When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. Story characters seem more real and more comfortable with situations. The concept of drama is similar, four women who guide us through friends and relationships with problems and conflicts along the way. Katie GP is a dark and amazing character that you find difficult to refer to and is the best friend of Trudi a widow. Trudi's character is warming up the heart because you can relate to the difficulties she has, along with being the only mother of the four. Jessica is a party girl very lonely and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a loving character and is closest to Siobhan, the new married who, while loving her husband completely, can not help her eyes wander her colleague. Throughout the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it could do well. It is different from other female dramas such as Sex and the City, or Disperate Housewives. If he played correctly, it could be the next cold. In addition, the male distribution is not bad for the eyes.
