Okay, here's what I'm thinking about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS box and I thought about myself, this seems interesting. I rented it and got it home. The boy was right, it was interesting. They put the spirits in dreams, in corpses and in everyday machines. But this must be the only place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Within the body of a snowman. I liked all the snow-friendly pictures of the landscape, the pot, the snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, and he has fun in a killer who has not been seen by FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's that level of "cool". I wish some of the puppet effects were better, mouth movements could have matched better. But I think up to a small budget. Distribution makes a great job, there is a great lining and scarecrow to make any hardcore slides of horror fans. All in all, a great story, good effects, great dialogue and excellent distribution. They give it JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
