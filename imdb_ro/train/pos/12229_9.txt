For me, there is something so appealing and nostalgic for low-budget sci-fi. Like a child in the 1950s, that's all. In 1957 I saw "The First Man in Space" in a cinema with my father. He played Marshall Thompson and some other poor people who were given the lead role. It's also a bad space mission if the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. I scared the good and the good from me. The memory of these heebie-jeebies still lives in me. The incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in glorious colors ... which is where the scenes were well lit. I have to love it for what it is ...... a little more than an hour of scenes with dark light, disgusting noises and strange music. Bravo!
