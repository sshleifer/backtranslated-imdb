"If I wanted to play, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Did not you have enough?" ... "More than enough" <br /> <br /> "You made me a choo-choo." "If I start to die, please remove (cowboy hat) from not wanting to be remembered." Some of the wonderful humorous quotations, and often inspired, from this charming and often insightful. Dudley Moore is charming, loving and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. The two have a non-father relationship and a son who defines the man Arthur has to do. Will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth? For over twenty-five years, I have returned to this film with joy, fun and joy. It's a movie to come back again, from time to time, and remember what's important in life, how short it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
