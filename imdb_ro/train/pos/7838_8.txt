If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend that you check this out. It features a capricious part of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having enough time to shoot some scenes that are not part of the concert but fun to look at, leaving you a sense of knowing them only as people, and when the concert is presented by a talented musician, both playful and professional, who rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls. Watching it in concert, you never knew that being a rock star is a job, but just a wonderful moment singing some wonderful songs with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of live shows. True, I miss some songs I'd like to see there, but like any other album I can not have it all. I just bought this in 2006, but if I knew it was out in 1972, I'd definitely have bought it a few years ago. Sad and odd that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and die in a car accident!
