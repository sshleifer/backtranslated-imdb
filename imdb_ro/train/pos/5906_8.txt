Doghi is a great movie, and Renuka Daftardar is great. So, Uttara Baokar is usually excellent in most of his roles. Together with Kairee, he is an example of the Marathi cinema at the highest level. There are certain parts in both films that are tending towards the didactic - it would probably have improved the movie in order not to have a few scenarios in which the social message is introduced. These scenes are likely to arise from the film's political preoccupations, but the film is realistic and moves enough not to need it. But, apart from the minor minor ones, a movie worth seeing more and one highly recommended. Sumitra Bhave's question and humanism shine.
