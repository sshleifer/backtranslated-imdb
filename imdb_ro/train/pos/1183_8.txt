A man returns to life only after 45 years of marriage. He also has to solve the issue of family milk cows, Tulip, who refuses to leave sweet. Until then, he imagines his wife, who was the one who gave the Tulip milk. The tulip is based on a real story from Griffith's family about her grandparents generation. The film is a nostalgic look back at a lost way of life, one in which people still felt a sense of responsibility for each other, established in the luxuriant green life of the Victorians (the Australian state was not). <br /> <br /> The writer and director Griffiths obviously has both ambitions in both areas, and this short 15-minute multi-award is a fine that starts with it.
