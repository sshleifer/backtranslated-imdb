Richard Linklater is a wonderful blend of youthful romance and the trip to Paris is one of the best romantic movies of the best man in the 90s. Julie Delpy turns into one of the most delightful performances of the decade, while leaving the Parisian who spends a day with Ethan Hawke, a stranger on a train. Dialogue (and its oud) is sometimes meandering and too precious, but this portrait of the two young wannabe lovers who make a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection between them is filled with wonderful, amusing and inspiring moments.
