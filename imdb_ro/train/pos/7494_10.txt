The mysterious murders in a European village seem to be the result of THE VAMPIRE BAT that affects the terrified community. This surprisingly successful thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood Poverty Row studios. The low production values ​​and the coarse edition add, in fact, its strange atmosphere and give it almost expressive quality. Generally, it leaves the viewer the feeling of being trapped in a bad dream that is suitable for such a thriller. Even if the possible explanation of criminal crimes is ridiculous and is not in view of the correct development of scenes, the film can boast a good distribution. Grave Lionel Atwill offers another typical performance, this time as a doctor in scientific research in an old castle. The beautiful Fay Wray plays the role of his assistant in a role that asks him to do little more than look great and alarmed. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as a perplex police inspector, who also happens to be conveniently Miss Wray's lover. Maude Eburne, who could be extremely funny considering the right situation, steals most of her scenes, aunt hippocampy. Elder Lionel Belmore plays the burgermeister terrified by the village. And little Dwight Frye, who will always be reminded of his strange roles in FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is most effective as a boy-loving madman.
