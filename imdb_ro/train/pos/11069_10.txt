"Ah Ritchie made another Statham gangster movie," the average fan thought, expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; probably waiting for a couple of time changes, but not too much for "me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. Be careful, you have to watch this movie. You do not have a cup of tea, you do not have extra coke on the counter, do not "keep it moving" yell while you go to the refrigerator - watch the movie! It laughs only what you can do from the considerable violence (and if that's what your boat is floating, that's it), but a solid direction, excellent dialogue and wonderful performances. My favorite - Big Pussy from The Sopranos, always a trusted coat.
