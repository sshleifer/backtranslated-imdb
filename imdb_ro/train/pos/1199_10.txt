This is the most convincing and excellent performance ever made by Robert Taylor. It even surpasses its wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager" coming 14 years after this film. His look is still a miracle I see, but now he has a maturity that gives him the advantage in this violent and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for money but for pleasure. Killing him with wild eyes not only by buffalo, but by human beings, it is amazing to look. He is, in principle, a single man who needs the people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is sick of hunting, and goes only along, because it's a failure in everything else. On the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and surprises the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her without success, but she sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a bit sad to look, so fed with the hunt, wanting to leave with her daughter and her baby. Lloyd Nolan, as skinner drunk, is awesome with his wise cracks and accordion play. Russ Tamblyn plays half of the race trying to fit into a white world. The group is a strange combination of good and bad, young and old. Eventually, Taylor is scared by buff, as many hunters had before him, and ran away leaving Sandy with his face. On his return that night, Sandy leaves with the woman, leaving Charlie on a killing fight in an attempt to get Sandy and have a girl for him. The final encounter comes in a snow storm, and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's all Taylor's film and he was really a much understated actor of the era.
