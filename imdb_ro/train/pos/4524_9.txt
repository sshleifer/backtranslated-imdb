This is a very rare example of a film about transvestite (heterosexual). The film deals with the taboo theme, so even a general audience that does not know transvestitism will feel strongly sympathetic to its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible like Gerald / Geraldine and will not be forgotten for this brilliant action. Christopher Monger's direction is very sensitive, dealing with such a difficult, rather excellent problem packed into a good story. It's not a big movie, no "art" movie, it's a great little movie!
