A unique movie ... one of the best of all time. Action, scenario, Quincy Jones score, cinema, editing, etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on Truman Capote's book on the famous murder of a Kansas farm family ("Clutters") by a couple of young people during a wrong robbery. I have never seen a movie that has transformed such a wonderful story into a riveting movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid everywhere, but the focus is on the murderers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team follows them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Coconut, twitchy, and uncompromising, he meets so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake, in the role of Perry Smith, is incredibly well - lonely, daring and cold. Who could use these features in one individual and get him to buy? He does, and he is brilliant! A key point of the book is how these two sociopathic individuals have had a very different intersection to create critical mass to commit such a bad and wild crime, and these two actors make it work nicely. Both have had moments in their later career, but these shows are big watermarks, and that means a period of action. <br /> <br /> Police officers are also wonderful. The lead of the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also wonderful. Unlike contemporary films in which producers find it necessary to equip policemen with over-human assets or weaknesses, they are only true, resolving the case with determination and competence. They seemed so real. I have never seen the police on the screen so strong in their authenticity; and I saw that most of the crime classes are coming back. Really unique in this sense. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL COLLECTION COMPLETE (this movie is unique in which you already know what happened but I warn about recording). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes in the best crime and movie shows are the interrogations - the intellectual confinement matches between policemen and criminals, Mano a Mano. This movie has your hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on the movie. Follow Dick and Perry to try to bluff their way and do it slowly, not knowing that the cops have the goods on them. But the cops must only prepare the suspects to break their alibis and, hopefully, to confess. These are some of the best actions you'll ever see. Glengarry Glen Ross, without showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and terrible angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at Clutter's house and I heard Clutters were played by students to give them a real feel. Works. They seem like decent, simple people. Makes the crime so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stop here. It's not a good movie, but it's one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory to watch for every movie.
