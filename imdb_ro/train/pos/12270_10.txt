I've been looking for this movie for years, it seems it's not available here in the United States, so she bought me a copy of Ebay. Four young hunters and three of their friends venture into the woods looking for a bear that has apparently killed several caravans. What they have discovered is an ex-Vietnam veteran veteran crazy (he kills some of his victims using a long metal nail glove at Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night collapses, one of the girls walks after a short argument with her boyfriend, she is murdered. Once a group finds its body, they all hide in their tents waiting for the light of day. Once the sun comes, everyone tries to do it, but they fall victim one by one. Seven corpses, not a lot of gore, but some good crimes, especially girls' deaths. Boys are killed in bloodless ways (blowing in the car, shot, knife in the head). In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice movie from the late 1980s. Nothing new, just acting well, fast pace and some beautiful ladies.
