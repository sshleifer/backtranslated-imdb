I've heard of Eddie Izzard, but I've never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw he was on HBO the last night last night, I put him, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he kicked us out. It's better than Robin Williams has ever been. He has total control over the audience; when he does "Englebert is dead - it's not him", the public does not know what to think until the end. God, like James Mason, is also an inspired influence and version of the Python Spanish Inquisition, performed by the Church of England - "Cake or Death"? it's useless. My jaws were painful to laugh until the end of the show. I scratched the tape recordings a few months afterwards so I could see him again and we were lucky to band him the next time he came. If you have the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tick it, you will not be disappointed.
