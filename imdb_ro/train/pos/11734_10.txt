This must be one of your favorite moves, unlike the "Haunted Hills" in Elvira ... anyway, I like how the movie is a goth / com "Wizard of Oz" story ... <br /> < Elvira is a Gothic Dorothy who is locked in an unknown city after the death of a Good Witch (elvira aunt Morgana) ... she inherits a very strong "Ruby" ring and sought by Bad Warlock (her uncle). .. She is friends with four characters that she unexpectedly helps to grow throughout the movie with a dog in the car. There is a show with her uncle (the evil witch of the West) where Elvira realizes she has the power inside her and ends up defeating him. Eventually, she is sent by the people of the city after she has won over her heart and finally arrives at Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). There are many references to the movie wizard ... she and her uncle cite relevant lines for their parallel characters. Elvira: "You have to be aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There is no place like home, there is no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I give you my beauty and your dog too!" There is a sign that Elvira passes when he is the first time on his way mentioning the state of Kansas. But besides, the fact that one of the sequences she "broke", I mean she was inspired by FlashDance "is a pure genius ... and if you do not rotate laughing at her title cracking at the end of her "very 80" show in Las Vegas, then you do not have a camp bone in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic
