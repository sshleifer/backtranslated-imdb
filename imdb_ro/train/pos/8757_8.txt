I like movies that do not offer the typical "happy ending" and this is my main reason why I liked this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend, Darlene (Beckinsale), are arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after an anonymous guy was sent to the Thai authorities. The movie does a good job of keeping viewers guess if (or which) of the girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their lawyer weakened. Jacqueline Kim is transforming into extraordinary performance as his more kind and extraordinary wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I want the girls to have been more abused in prison, as suggested by another commentator, as I have heard that prisons in Thailand can be quite brutal. Where this movie grabs me, it ends. Alice has been sentenced for 96 years in all, so Darlene can be pardoned and we (the viewers) understand that they are so innocent. Any movie that defies my expectation of finishes wins extra points with me, and this well-acting drama definitely deserves.
