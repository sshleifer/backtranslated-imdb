I voted excellent for how well the actor was, not the content. She still gives me chills after reading the book, then I looked at the movie. Two ex-consuls travel to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe counselor during the prison. During the trip, the tension begins to increase as the soundtrack adds to the general anticipation. After the killers have finished their work on the farm, the next morning the family remains found by the friend of the daughter's church. The blood squeezing, as the scene slid on the phone with the cut cord, really made me the cold of blood and gave me chills. That the killers met their righteous fate is a little comfort for this condemned family. Robert Blake was excellent in the portrait of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.
