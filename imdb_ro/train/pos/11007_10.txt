Morgan Sullivan's characterization of Jeremy Northam, in a gentle manner, aims to leave pieces and fragments of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotch and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to look at. Offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and losing her face, throat and lips. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way of perseverance. Also, love can not be "brainwashed" with one of the two fake spouses. Gradually, he begins to give up his glasses, walk and speak differently, and even his face looks different as the movie progresses. Music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and drove properly at times. The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes this movie almost noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's portrait, whenever he sees it in his different states, the man he loves, and for whom he performs a mission based on blind faith, a narrow vulnerability, and brilliance of genuine sympathy and worry would have made it a less dimensional performance on its part. It never matches Northam's talent, but in all I liked this movie very much and I'm glad to know about other scenarios written by the same author.
