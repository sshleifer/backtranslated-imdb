I had fun with my red eyes. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well guided and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yeah, it's the same old story with another place, but Wes Craven gave him a good rhythm. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when the originality does not stand out as its main character. In particular, from a film producer such as Craven, who has brought so many innovative ideas into the thriller and horror genre in the past, and who is just borrowing to bring home what could have been a good TV movie if it were not was released theatrically. Good job!
