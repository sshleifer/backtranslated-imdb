Reese Witherspoon first appeared on the big screen, being a memorable one. It appears as a fresh, fresh "tween" face and string, but undoubtedly Reese. I always liked acting as an actor, and I had no idea that this young woman started her career, go to figures. In fact, I've earned a respect for Reese to know who was so early. I say this because every time I watched it, the characters so far in each portrait seemed to have its own personality, who lived with that character, pretty pretty actually. the film experience with Reese was Little Red Riding Hood parody, which Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, in a way I supposed it was the first time in a "bat" Not so, well done Reese
