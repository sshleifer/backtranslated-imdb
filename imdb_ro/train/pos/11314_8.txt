Wow! A kind of movie you could see ten times and still pleased with its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film, I wake up to think what would happen if it were better from film to film. The only one I've seen (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but his story was not like an involvement like Ossessione. If you click "various" on the links of this page, there are photos from the movie on those sites. They will not really make the film's experience: such graphic camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such wonderful characters, such a great story, the first film adapted to James M Cain "The Postman Always Rings Twice. "I can not believe it was done in 43 years, eight years before Brando introduced the actors with Streetcar Named Desire (1951) to the real world. The actors may not have used the technique of the method, that is, they did not really feel everything in themselves (they know nothing about it) - but they are some of the best, more authentic and performer ever before in the cinema. Also, eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing at the beginning of cinema! Yeah, I'm superlative, but Ossessione was just that great. The reason why Ossessione did not cause the impact that the Streetcar has made was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini, cut off in America. The American public has not seen its full glory up to 59, eight years after the tram. I'm not going to say anything about it - I'm just writing to tell you one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies I've ever seen and tell you to come out and see them! Like another reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I can find it!
