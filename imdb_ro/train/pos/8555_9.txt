* First of all, although many say it's the worst of the series, I do not think it's true, since it reflects ideally the mentality of the 21st century teen. It offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you by the good teenager or when you wanted to have the same fun as the characters. I agree with the fact that it's a teenage film, but today's comedy films should not be for teenagers? ... cinemas are largely the place for teenagers; Plus, seeing such a movie during a sleep or something like that is great to have a very good time. * Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... to be real ... does it reflect the teenage thoughts of the movie? what do you want to see ... smart books, romantic things? which is not at all what would be in the minds of these teenagers ... In conclusion, I think if you are a teenager you must absolutely see the movie and even if you are a really grown man or woman, you have to see if you still have a teenage mind or you often think about how a teenager was, or things like that. Thanks for reading!
