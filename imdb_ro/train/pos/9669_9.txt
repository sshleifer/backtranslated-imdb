After reading the original piece, I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to the screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann sets up an extraordinary performance like Public Gar, the suppressed antagonist, who is openly screened by his extroverted character (but unseen by others). Eamonn Kelly also plays excellent "screws", whose inability to communicate their feelings is only fit for Gar. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worthwhile to rent it if you find it. (Probably unavailable outside of Ireland and the United Kingdom)
