I finished watching this movie, maybe for the 7th or 8th time, I took her one night before at Blockbuster and I loved it absolutely, I showed it to 4 people so far and they liked them too. Avoid the brilliance of Hollywood, special effects and stress on the "shock factor," this film independent of Paul F. Ryan hits the angle of the head in treating post-traumatic affections. Taking place after a high school, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely relationship. Alicia, the heart of stone, Goth, who has a pessimistic attitude toward life, helps Deanna overcome the problems of life and death and live behind. Meanwhile, Deanna tries to help Alicia see again from the light and light in the world. Without focusing on the shocking event of filming, but on interpersonal relationships between survivors, this film is shared. Despite the short and short filming time, this film is far from being cheese. Ryan gives respect to a situation he has never suffered and tries to enslave himself in the human psyche. With a stunning actress, Philipps adds drama to dialogue and the overall sense of the film, and Christensen helps balance the sense of "doom and sadness" that this movie can have. In general, I recommend this film, and if you enjoy the subject of aggression and violence in school and learn more about it, we also suggest the document "It's a Girl World" released by CBC in 2004, addressing social bullying, contrasting two groups of girls, one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14 year old girl who committed suicide after being brutally brutalized.
