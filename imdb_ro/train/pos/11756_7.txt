The film did not do well at the box office. I saw her in a preview of me. <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie that past players played. It's not the best ever movie on the screen but nice. Robin did well with him as the role of Robin Jack's best film from the beginning: "I was SOB!" Cleaned here so as not to offend anyone. He was glad when he came to the DVD some years back in large screen / letter box format. I am not a fan of football or a true sports fan. But, you do not have to be one to enjoy this movie.
