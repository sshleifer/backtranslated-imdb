That's why I love this site! I saw this film in the 1980s on British television. Over the years, I wanted to know more about how it stayed with me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With just a few key words I can remember, I watched the movie here and a lot of information, including about being off-Broadway music! Interestingly, unlike the author of the previous comment, I do not remember finding this sad movie or exploiter. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter remained in the mind as a testimony of great power, honor and dignity. You can think irrationally, considering the misery of their lives. Maybe because I live in the UK, where the grandiose blush has established language in the lives of old money, where the swamp is often tolerated as evidence of good reproduction; I have seen it as a rare and unique representation of the enormous spirit, profound and profound humor, whose extremely fragile and delicate balanced fabric gave it poetry and respect. In a way I was sick to see that it was discussed as a "cult." Over the years, as my mind disappeared, it shone on the brightest, above all others, as an extraordinary and remarkable television experience. It was such a private exposure, it sounds weird to think about becoming so public that it's a musical in New York. But maybe somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such a result. She is the one who will have the last laugh maybe .. (They made a musical out of it before you Jackie O ')
