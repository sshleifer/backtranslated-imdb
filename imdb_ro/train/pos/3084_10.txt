Man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all linked to someone. If I focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. When I first heard about this show, it did not attract attention at all. It seemed too ordinary. Then I saw some episodes ... and I loved it! First of all, the characters. Everything is well written and different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose fiancee deceives her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother, and so on ... Unlike what we are accustomed to, most characters interact with one with the other in the victims, as in our daily routine. That's great! The most preferred are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. Then the distribution. Everything is wonderful. Jay Hernandez from "Hostel" shows here his acting skills in a character more than his previous work as Paxton. The others also give extraordinary performance, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. Well, when I came to IMDb, after seeing a few episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. It's too bad he did not have more than a year. It would really be a good show to follow!
