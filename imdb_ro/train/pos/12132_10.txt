Glad despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mister. Howard interprets Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. One should cool for this man; however, I find myself cheering on Bild Davis "Mildred." Ms. Davis gives her one of the best performances (she received an Oscar nomination), because of her performance she brings to life that boring movie. that you do not miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels about him.
