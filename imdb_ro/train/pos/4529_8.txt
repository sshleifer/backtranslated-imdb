As is well known among long-haired youngsters and who are incredibly interested in Herr Graf's silent thoughts, during the summer the aristocrats prefer to travel to exclusive and distinct places to avoid the warmth and hordes of grosse men. Such bizarre journeys all over the world are also happening in the "Three Ages," a charming and elegant work of silent work, guided by old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. Obviously, this German number enjoyed the first segment concentrated on the Stone Age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels at that ancient time. preferring this to the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, ie barbarians or the same Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago it should qualify as modern. The leitmotiv that moves Herr Keaton and his comrades to travel and endure the weird and cheerful happenings over three different ages is the quest for love, a very complicated subject for the aristocrats who prefer to search for money and their own interest. Every time "The Three Ages" is featured in Schloss Theater, it's always a pleasure to watch a funny and funny movie (even for a serious German), a show full of gags and gadgets, visual and amazing technical tricks , an absolutely silent delicacy, which is perfect for allowing someone to withstand the diversity and hardness of the summer. this German container has to flirt with an old teutonic heiress who does not look at her age.
