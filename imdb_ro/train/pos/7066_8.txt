This movie is so old that I never realized how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember playing in a wonderful movie "Lost Weekend." Ray plays Michael Stuart, who is a very rich banker. There are three girls who are not very pleased with the separation of their father and mother and find that their father will marry a young blonde who is a gold monk who is looking for a father who is rich in sugar. They hire a man he represents as a very rich count, his name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer), who is drunk all the time and is helpless and offers many comic laughs in the whole picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star and then began singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I heard, the whole police station and convicts have begun to applaud, which was a very fun and enjoyable scene in this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first debut debut and became instantly hit overnight and became a big movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
