Besides the great film METROPOLIS, it's about the oldest sci-fi SF movie. While sometimes the movie is a little predicate and the acting may be a bit broad, it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original both in style and in content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films to think of as something like that. Secondly, for its own time, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using matte paintings, patterns and huge throws to create amazing scenes from both the post-apocalyptic world and the amazing city of the hand. Sure, you could sit back and beat the movie because, according to today's standards, the effects are just that. But you have to appreciate that this was one of the last generation when the movie came out in 1936 and must really be amazed by the audience. In many ways, the sets show very well that "Modern Towns" appeared at the World Trade Fair in 1939. I think the movie is also interesting because it seems to have been broken by the question, "are people truly those hives or are we destined for greatness?" The result the final seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> A final note: I saw this twice on TV and just a little while ago on the video. Three times the quality of the sound and print quality has been hampered - especially the sound. If this is available on a DVD, we hope it is much cleaner and will offer optional subtitles. As the sound on the video continues to cut, I would have appreciated it!
