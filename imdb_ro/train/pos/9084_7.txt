Yes, some people said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm kind of dying hard dragon / world-end / holy carp fan action movie. But if you take it from my point of view this movie had some of the best chances of action were pretty good dang. But that movie that has fallen harder at the right time or just when it's bad has fallen something to save at the right time. Although there were some fun lines and gangs in the whole movie that surprised me. 3D graphics were pretty good. I mean for this type of movie 3D effects were great !! A big battle that was presented in the trailer lived up to any sentiment the movie had. The fight between good and bad at the end was, I have to say it could have been longer and a little better, it was still pretty good. Now to the parts I think might have been better. The beginning was pretty good, showing the parts that led to the big battles. I mean if you do not even want to go see this movie in theaters, then at least it's a DVDer ... generally I liked the movie, but the plot just fell instead of fast and better fit just fine .
