I saw this movie at a preview and I was amazed by it. It is not the typical romantic comedy. I do not remember laughing so much at a movie and still be excited about it. The laughter is not gags here - there are observations, laughs of recognition, small shocks of "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not give up the plot, which is more than "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth since "You've slept." <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes deeper than he left before, and for the first time I really enjoyed it. The distribution is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I loved in other roles, but they mix to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is marvelous like her mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and hilarious (who knew it was funny), and even Dane Cook, given, offers a warm, quiet and moving performance. The soundtrack Sondre Lerche is a wonderful addition, and I will buy the CD, the second is available. Do not miss this.
