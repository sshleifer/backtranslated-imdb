An interesting TV movie, based on the truth, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate task of deciding whether to go to court for his brother's death penalty. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem starts. It has nothing to do with Koteas's ability to act. He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "G., with too sophisticated language for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars." This accomplishment came to me after an encounter with an old a friend I have not seen for almost 15 years in several Panama prisons. The young man I met disappeared, not only because he is older but because of the prolonged exposure to the system There are prisons and there are prisons, it must be said, but this prisoner of "Shot In the Heart" is certainly out of this world.
