Ghost Story (TV film - 1972) was the NBC series pilot. The film was well written and well-outlined and, as I thought, began the 1972-73 season, if the television series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I would like this movie to be available on the video!) The series was a colossal disappointment - even with William Castle as an executioner. manufacturer. If, however, you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
