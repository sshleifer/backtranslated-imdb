An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is taken care of by his grandfather. Together, they find a common place in the Welsh folk tale stories that were transmitted orally from generation to generation of insulans. Though tragic episodes, such as Highland clearances, appear in stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. Everything is filmed in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is astonishing and it is a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic talk. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of the Gaelic is, however, wonderful. Performances are exactly what you would expect from other carefully selected actors - in other words, you look at the real things - people who are deeply engaged in folklore and Welsh history. The Gallic community, especially Skye, has worked countless minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic, folkloric history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go to see this film.
