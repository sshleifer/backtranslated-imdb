Apart from the fact that, in all that is wonderful, this movie has grown beyond all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrays the excess of crappy filters at its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brother conflict with everything that exists. As usual a woman concealing her true intentions. The end was as surprising as unforssen as the killing of Keith Scott by his older brother. The scenes in the "wiking field" are just as I remember from my early journeys. - To be honest, my strong passion for garbage makes this a necessity in my never-ending collection. We recommend this movie to all loved by the most beautiful brother of One Tree Hill. <br /> <br />
