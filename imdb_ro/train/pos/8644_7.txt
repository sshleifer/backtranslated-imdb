**** = a masterpiece that will be recorded in books and never forgotten *** 1/2 = A classic in time; you just have to see it *** = A solid piece in time, very fun ** 1/2 = A good movie but there are some unequal or visible elements <br /> < br /> ** = Can still be considered good in the area, but this work has serious problems or is restricted by the inevitable elements considered inevitable (eg genre) * 1/2 = In the sea side, a bunch of nothing has sparked light moments worth it <br /> <br /> BOMB = Does not have a visible quality - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> - Not rated (for strong violent materials, considerable sexuality and language) We rented this film waiting for a Brad Pitt summer holiday, and disappointed. This is really more of a drama, and very gloomy at that ... I remember some emotionally powerful Duchovny-sister-voices. Pitt plays a sexiest movie ever, with an amazing talent. Who started out as a hopeless, but innocuous, "white trash", became a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a miserable mind. In some of the final stages of the movie, it was hard to watch him - it was unpredictable and scary. This proves to be very good writing and acting. The whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me breathless no less than once and do not refer to action scenes. I mean, dialogue scenes, so brilliant in detail, actually, I stabbed myself and gawked at what I had seen. It was like looking at a rhinoceros and a lion in a cage and watching how each other was dying to death. Again, I am very impressed by the screenwriter (s); whoever would have made it impossible: mixed oil and water. I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It's so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy. Some of the moments in this movie brought me to tears. I want to say that. The emotions that this girl can awaken in the head are incredible, and I remember clearly that I realized blurred on a few occasions. I almost feel like I am wrong with the quality craftsmanship that the filmmakers have shown only by offering the "rating" KALIFORNIA ***. But the dark feelings they are excited are too strong and depressing to lift them I think everyone should see this movie.
