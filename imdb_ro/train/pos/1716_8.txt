Abhay Deol meets Soha Ali Khan and welcomes "Good Sister" !!! This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl, fled from her Nainital home and came to Delhi to marry her boyfriend, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not return, leaving Soha heartless and alone in the bad world. . Abhay, the inferior side-class returns to Soha and helps them get jobs and shelter in an old house. Slowly, blooming blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan rejoins Soha's life. A sensational film, with a very unusual story, deftly shot in Delhi, revolves around delicate Soha. This well-done film has moments that will always be engraved in someone's memory? Abhay's first unforgivable apology and quick excuse; Abhay describing Soha as a "wali ladki class" and adding hurriedly "that he does not love her"; giving him a snarl to Soha and asking for a meeting. <br /> <br /> Music is good and great background music. In a scene where Soha hurries and embraces Abhay, the sound track disappears. The silence transmits both the left and the tenderness of the relationship. The end of pain makes a bitter film sweet, the memories of which will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> I have to see that I will evaluate 8.5 / 10
