Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his very good roles in a series based on long-lasting success (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts out a beautiful and sad figure, not has received several roles if he could be the type of commander in a good way. Here Chandu returns from the East to help Princess Nadji, who is hunted by Ubasti cult leaders, who need her to bring the cult priestess back from the dead. This is a beautiful-looking series that is really fun. To make sure that the rhythm is a little weaker, closer to one of the major producers (production studios), then it is a strange adventure, but it is still enjoyable. This plays better than the two feature films that have been cut from it because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling quick or having the feeling of "I missed something." One of the trilogies of the three good series that Lugosi has done, the other being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
