ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as a braggart from an Irish family who fought to become the world champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) claimed he could "beat any man in life." Both Flynn and Ward Bond are likely to be among the best performances they ever have on the screen. Raoul Walsh directed the colorful story with a robust style that captures family life with scenes that are warm, hearty and humorous. All Warner contract gamers make up the fine cast - always including the reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's father, proud of the skills of his battle son and ALEXIS SMITH, who takes full advantage of her role as a little girl in society who enjoys taking Flynn down a hat with unique pots that deals with his horrified manners. All the atmosphere of the 1880s is captured in the glorious white, though it's too bad Warners did not trust Flynn anymore to make the movie in color. He entered a rocky phase of his film career at that time, engaged in a widely publicized rape trial, which had all tabloids busy sorting things out. Battle scenes are amongst the best ever choreographies for the screen, with Flynn, of course, in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond returns Flynn's prize plaque to a social gathering is one of Ward's most beautiful moments in a long career as a character actor. Summary: Maintain interest by being a sports fan or not.
