Gandhi, my father, is like seeing a book, chapter by chapter you read (with your eyes), and you will learn more about Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi, respectively. So little is known about both and this film describes them uniquely. The title misleads, however, a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya are right in the fullness of their roles. Such films are similar to good years. They come after so long. Gandhi, my Father, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any fight of freedom ever made. if you like the quality cinema.
