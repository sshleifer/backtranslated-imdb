Normally, I'm skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps the author was an executive producer and writer, right?) The distribution is remarkable. I can not describe how much I liked to see such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). Setting the location ... I expected to see the houses and chalets I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, it was not enough to make me not like the mini-series. I recommend this to anyone who read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
