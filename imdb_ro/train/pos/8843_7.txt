The humor involved in the complete title of the title comes from Sunday School Dictation that someone would be better advised to prepare before you were dead for the Devil's research, that is, the Devil does not care when you are dead. There is no percentage in trying to beat the devil. The characters apparently did not pay attention to the Sunday school and were forced to manage crises, avoiding crises. But even a CEO will have difficulty managing these crises. Dropping dice is more unpredictable than throwing a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible results becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable movies Sidney Lumet. Until now, Hawke might not have been an unforgettable actor but probably had an eye to win the bill among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.
