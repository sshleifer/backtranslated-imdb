As other reviewers have noted, this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the movie because it is a fairly accurate picture of what must have been a trading post. Plus, exposure is required, so we know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the movie contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying tracking sequences ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group has to overcome a tribe of cannibals. Pre-censorship production values ​​add a lot of realism, which really depict the terrible dangers that Europeans were waiting for to enter the jungle. Also, the film offers, although probably an antecedent, an accurate description of how nasty Africans were treated horribly by their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some lovely sets and two putties! Do not miss a classic adventure.
