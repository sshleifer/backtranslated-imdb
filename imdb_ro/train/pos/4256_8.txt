Such a delightful movie! Very warm the heart. I can not help you fall in love with Gigi's character. She is adorable as a child and becomes a sensible artist. The whole movie revolves around him. Does he live in a wonderful world? living all his life? curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is a big brother who tries to steal his glory, but he really remains in the shade of his whole life. The father is very stereotypical in Italian and so is his mother. Did I want my father to come and meet my mom on the last scene? and to weep and laugh. I also want to have at least something redeeming about the older brother. His personality seems to have been drawn entirely. Passion and ardor? that's the key to life. And we look through the room? focusing on small details and enjoying the delicate details of life.
