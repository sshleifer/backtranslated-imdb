The WWE's last PPV in 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason, the scale match, to be just Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent PPVs that took place in December, Demeure, WWE knew he had to do something to make fans talk again, this proved useful when he introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to mix and announced that the game will be the match of the scale. The match was brutal and one of the best stadium matches I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check his partner, but continued as if nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the game, except for a few ladders. Finally, London and Kendrick retained the titles. Elsewhere, Kane defeated MVP in a decent infernal match when he lit the stupid costume of MVP. Chris Benoit lowered Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. But the main event was a total mess, King Booker collaborated with Finlay to get John Price and Batista. The action was implacable and no one cared who chose Batista for his partner. Total results: Kane defeated MVP in a hell game. Paul London and Brian Kendrick kept WWE Labeling team titles against Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a stadium match.
