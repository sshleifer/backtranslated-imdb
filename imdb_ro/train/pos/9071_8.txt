Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities. Action and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept. Those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty, since "bulls" are real enough to cause more than a few in the audience. Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg have stolen the spotlight, but young Ty Panitz may have a serious time on screen in the next few years. Miss Eisenberg developed from a pretty face a young powerful actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery. <br /> <br /> The story has a spectacular job in dealing with aggression, friendship and fairness. It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and sincere manner, while recalling a "raw" scene in the film.
