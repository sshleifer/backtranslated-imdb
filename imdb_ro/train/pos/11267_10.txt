Robert Wuhl teaches a student class at New York University in Manhattan, New York. It covers the errors of history and truths that are no longer known in general. I would like to see much more of this show. It's very funny. Mister. Wuhl uses examples and "looks and says" to get his points. He explained that the person who actually led Paul Revere's midnight walk was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because he sounded better. I watched Robert Wuhl for many years, from the moment he made a stand-up comedy and all the way through "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedian stand-up, but he is an excellent teacher! I recommend you to look at an episode of this show. It is well worth it.
