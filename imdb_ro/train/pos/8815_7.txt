This collection of eleven short short stories in a movie is a great idea and presents some big segments, as well as some disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors have been invited to present their approach to American tragedy. The result of the majority is not just an individual sympathy for the American people, but rather an intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. Ken Loach (UK) presents the best segment, on September 11, 1973, in Chile, when the democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States. The other excellent segments are Youssef Chahine (Egypt) indicating intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by US governments in different countries throughout contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the US when he was indeed a hero. are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children in Afghanistan preparing a safe homeless bomb, while their teacher tries to explain what happened to the other side of the world; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) presents the life of a New York couple near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) presents the effects of their war in a small location and the individual protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life continues; and the story of Shohe Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war, but sadness and shame. The Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) segment is very naive, but it illustrates the terrible conditions this African country. The Amos Gital (Israel) segment is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, (Brazil): "11 by Setembro" ("September 11").
