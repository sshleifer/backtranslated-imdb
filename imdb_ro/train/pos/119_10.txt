The best way to describe Europe, which is on the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation that came from a partner after the film ended: "I did not know the movies could be done like that." Completely original, in its visual style, this is one of the best examples of cinema. It is just as far from the "master and cover" style of filming, as it can be; perfect integration of multiple layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc ... all equal, none predominant. Despite the myopia of "Hollywood" dialogue, cinema is not about dialogue, lighting, action or beautiful music. It works best when all elements are on an equal footing, in which only BLENDING of those elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reducing or eliminating the contribution of an element, and the movie makes no sense. "Europe" is what the cinema should strive to be.
