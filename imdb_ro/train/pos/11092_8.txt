52-Pick Up has never received the respect he should have. It works on several levels and has a complicated plot but pursued. The actors involved provide some of the best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly cast and offer profound characters portraits. Vanity is also remarkable, who should have shared it in a serious career, given the unexpected ability of Kelly Preston, the character who will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action, combined with a complicated, crushed story, will enjoy this.
