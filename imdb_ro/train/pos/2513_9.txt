Beautiful made. A lot of anger. Friendship can not bear everything, but ultimately it's all that matters, or so a group of friends is learning. I looked at her again and again. Music is also amazing. When Kei loses his only friend he quits until he meets Sho, an orphan boy who is not rejected by his true nature. On the streets of Mallepa, they struggle for their place in a pot of Asian racing and find that sometimes being on the top can cost you more than you will ever be willing to pay. One end of surprise that behaves as much as the whole movie. I could not get it. Gackt and Hyde are doing a great job of acting, proving that they are more than the cute boys singing.
