I was in a bad mood when I first saw this movie. For some reason, he clicked on all the levels, the tensions in a family, loneliness, and one's lack of sharing your life. It did not hurt that someone who shared your life was a beautiful girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the audio track for this movie (very hard to get). Beloved and I hope someday he will come out of the DV
