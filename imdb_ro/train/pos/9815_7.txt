As the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released for years later), he deserves the watch. De Niro's role is not huge and yet funny that one of the two friends who first try to prevent another marriage with friends to chase him later to force him. Any furious De Niro will take a shot at an early performance by the best actor today.
