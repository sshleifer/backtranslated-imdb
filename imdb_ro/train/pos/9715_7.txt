This is what is weak, it seems to be much older than I thought it was. But it's still cold. Bicycle mechanisms are cold and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope to work on by myself in the 2nd part and my biggest complaint about everything that seems to be a MACROSS stick. Not just the animation style, but more character patterns. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY by MACROSS. Mechs look similar to MACROSS, as well as other characters. This is not really done for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So to make a short short story, I will give this MACROSS cooler hurt 7 STARS.
