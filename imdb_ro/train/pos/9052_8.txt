This is a beautiful drama and a pleasant change in the more agitated and stronger pace of shooting. It's another solid store based on a true one that still means that much of it could be done for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I do not know, but I liked the story. The story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in coal mines like everyone else, including his father, in this West Virginia city. The big problem is the conflict that is provoked between the boy and his father, which I think has been overwhelmed. I wish I had some tension between the two. The young man, another boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first missions to look, I think. He is full of love, as are his school friends here. It's nice to see beautiful kids in a modern movie. The two key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (the teacher of the child who encourages him all the time.) The cinema is a decent soundtrack of the 1950s is fun to hear. Again: I want more such films made today.
