This is the second short animation, and the first one is what can be called "artistic." It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a running time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human," or trying to hate man, for "machine sins." I do not think it is true; only robots are used to show us that as humans we are not particularly accepted or open to anyone other than ourselves. I'd say she's doing a great job. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document, telling what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So she owns clips from fictional news and the like. The voice actor is very good, if there is not much. The animation is nice and the use of colors, despite the usual realistic style, makes it more open to make smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has some bits of violent violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a little nudity. The disk has a comment, not in English, but subtitled, and deserves to be listened / read. There is also a well-made and informative achievement, based on both sides, so I would advise to follow it after seeing the next one. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the universe of Matrix and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
