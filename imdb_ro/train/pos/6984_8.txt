I was amazed by the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always guessed me and brought me to tears several times. A forced sci-fi fan, I like to think I can choose the good things from BS, and that was a good thing. So, when I first heard about the prospect of a series of prequel months ago, I had a sick feeling in my bowel. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. The story of BSG, a troop of shattered survivors, caught on board ships destroying star ships and guided by prophetic vision and a series of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly matched by extraordinary music and a better adventure of the actors. Caprice feels different. If BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica describes that civilization in cold and decadent glory. The total vibration we obtained from Caprica was similar to that of the minority ratio, minus the excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In the true form of BSG, Caprica has already addressed the issues of religious freedom, racism, morality to play God and the nature of the human soul already in the first few hours of programming. Castration for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessive and distant scientist to his disturbing and intentional daughter, each actor and actress casts themselves into their respective roles. Music, which has been so heavily used in BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Powerful batons and tumultuous drums served very good themes. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound that gives the show its own feeling quite different from any of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is certainly its own show, drawing from the Battlestar franchise just as much as it needs. I look forward to the full series.
