Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can tell a lot about this series, and it has been said a lot, so I will not be the one to write everything for you again. Just read the people who loved it and you will know why you want to watch it. The beautiful thing about this series is that it is completely new. There are not too many movies - and even fewer - just suspense on the subject, but Lost lives proudly with the theme. Everything about inexplicable and if you combine this with an exotic location, beautiful breathtaking, excellent distribution and good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you will have a series where each episode is a story about it but part of a bigger stories. You want to have all the information about the characters, you want to see the general picture and you will want to know where your writers are going. The result is that it's a series that does not let you go. In a more skeptical note, the series fell slightly in Season 2, perhaps due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was written for only one initial season and when the overwhelming success followed, the writers were overwhelmed as well. In my opinion, they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and at a higher pace in season 2, then solving the (or at least) those of season 1. At the end of season 2 you end up with a big blur of secrets, plotting, and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much a viewer can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 was huge. Season 3 sent a lot of information to replace them with new questions. And that's exactly what he should write; want to beat you from one twisted plot to another, do not get a secret tsunami spread all over and then pick up a few to explain to the audience. They have arrived in season 3 and offer us a promising future for Season 4. It is good to see that such a different format of a series can be so popular.
