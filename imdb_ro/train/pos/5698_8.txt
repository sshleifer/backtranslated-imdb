Val Kilmer ... His love or death, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and takes a performance that makes you go "Hey! This guy is a great actor!" He did it in Jim's leather pants in The Doors and did it again in John's leather pants. Back in the autumn and fall of the porn star king John Holmes, Kilmer gathered on his knees, I discovered one of the greatest murder mysteries that Hollywood did not has never solved them for over twenty years, and Holmes, the key suspect, to brutal Manson style abuse. What Kilmer does so effortlessly, celebrity, does anything for everyone who overwhelms whoever has it and then he lost it. Go see him, you'll know what I mean.
