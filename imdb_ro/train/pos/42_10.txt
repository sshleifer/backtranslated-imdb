Busy Phillips put in a hell of a show, both comedic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie in which he played busy, which was not so great. If busy do not get a nomination of any kind for this movie would be a disaster. Look at Mona Lisa Smile, see the room at the House.
