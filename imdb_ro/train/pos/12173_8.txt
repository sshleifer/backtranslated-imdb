First a shut up! for those who say this movie smells. You can not go to every movie that's waiting for "Citizen Kane". It was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I do not think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. He should have lived a little longer. Besides, the movie is fun. Selma Blair has to eat something. I'm worried. But it still looks nice. So yes, I recommend this movie for a meeting or a light afternoon. Go see. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 of ****
