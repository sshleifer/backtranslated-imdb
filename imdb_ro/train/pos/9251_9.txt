what can I say ?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and like an Italian American, the number one feminine beauty can not forget this movie. You know you do not remember much about the plot or about the situations or about the other actors. I can only remember Erika and that in this movie it looks better than ever, I really do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the beautiful moments that I had a teenager in Brooklyn contemplating just the beauty of Erika. Well, just to conclude if you are a fan of the beauty of Erika Eleniak, like me, surely this movie is for you.
