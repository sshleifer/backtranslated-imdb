I'm Italian, and when I watched this movie again I am amazed by its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the mind and the adult feelings. Now I can understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), since then. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic films are good ... for fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" does not have the English version, because it's not funny ... it's not good for the pop-horn and horn audience. However, according to Homer Pathos and existentialist reflections. In Italy, a very good DVD version was released recently: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find a file sharing, but it's only Italian and no subtitles. Too bad: the dialogues and voices of this movie are remarkable.
