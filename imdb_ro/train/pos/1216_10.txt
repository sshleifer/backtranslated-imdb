As a child I preferred the first Care Bear because it looked so dark. I sat down and looked at it first. As I grow older, I learned to prefer this. What I think is that this movie is too dark for babies, but as you learn to learn to appreciate it since you understand it more, it does not look as dark as when you were a child. > <br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is much deeper. It may contradict the first film, but you have to ignore the first movie to watch this movie. The puppies are too adorable, "Flying My Colors". I tend to bother everyone singing it. The soundtrack is great! A big hand for Carol and for Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I downloaded everything and all I'm listening to, listening to "Our Beginning", also known as "Remembrance" at this moment. I always preferred this sound at first, although I just totally love Carol Kings' song in the first Care-A-Lot movie. I think the animation is great, the animation in both movies is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and looked about 10 years later and saw that the animation for time was excellent. It was really surprising. There is not a lot of backup people from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird / odd. I think it's a great movie. In principle, this film refers to how the bears of care also came to defeat the demon, the dark heart. The end is surprising and once again, beat any "Pokemon movie" with moral care issues. It has an effect on you. Again, this film can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
