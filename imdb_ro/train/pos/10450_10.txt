By chance, we scanned the television channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful human beings who draw each other in a very innocent and virgin approach to each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 Seriale TV (Nicole). This gallop and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deep in your past relationships and how you really want to follow your hearts with a guy or person you loved and lost- over the years. Jesse and Celine have an extraordinary conversation and profound contact with a big magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to SEQUEL for this movie in 2004 and if you've seen this movie, you'll feel the same.
