This is a wonderful film of spirit restoration. From using the real villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920's inspired casting, every choice was perfect! The quiet joy of this film does not fade after repeated viewing. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
