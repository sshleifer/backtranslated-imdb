Hickory Dickory Dock was a good mystery Poirot. I confess I did not read the book, despite being a fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation is unmistakable, there have been times when humor and valuable attempts to do this were a little tangled, and the events that led to the final solution havetened. I also thought there were some lazy moments, so some of the mystery felt lined. However, I liked how the Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, had a visual style very similar to the brilliant ABC murder, and really set the atmosphere, what with the dark room and the dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat horrific, and this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as the One Two Buckle My Shoe that gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as complicated as Buckle My Shoe, and in a way it's a good thing. The actress was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use this word forever, but I do not think of a better word to describe his performances in the series) like Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran are right to their brilliant whole characters. And the students had great and well-developed personalities as a whole, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, a solid mystery, but it does not rank the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
