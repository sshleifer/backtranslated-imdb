I think this movie is really fun and horrible. I like Elvira and I love this movie. He is very fond of the fact that the second part of this wonderful film was not successful, because it is very funny as a first part. I also regret that, in addition to this film, I have never seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is a stunning actress with great potential. I hope I will see her in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of the most favorite comedies actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, you know that you are the best and that my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What can I add more? This movie is cool and classic!
