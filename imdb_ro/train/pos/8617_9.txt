"GI Samurai" sees that Sonny Chiba and other guys travel back to feudal Japan hit by civil war for no special reason, and many characters are produced. It's a little bit above the top-of-the-essay sword vs. machine gun that eventually brings some interesting results. The parcel essentially runs along the rails that might be expected from the title; ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "we are not better here" discussions and, ultimately, a huge fight. The latter is proof that the film is not taken seriously, the meat taking over most of the second half as the samurai army fights the Chiba platoon; a face you fully expect from the title, but still manages to overwhelm with inventiveness and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does not shoot despite its extensive length. Chiba gives a hard interpretation as Iba, initially a good ruler, but someone who finally wakes up doubts as the situation slowly has an effect on him. This is certainly one of the best vehicles in his extraordinary career. By the final act, the two worlds have had one effect on each other, you have to ask if it was a bit of nihilism from the writers because they seem to ask, "Are we not better then?" But this is probably reading a little more in being can generally be described as a very fun two hours of (almost) non-stop action.
