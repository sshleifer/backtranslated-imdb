I had a uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the mental problems he experienced after returning. When I saw part of this movie one night on a pay-per-view channel, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle had done and felt when he got ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most uncertain film I've ever seen. I bought the DVD right after I hired it. The way you pull in many emotional directions is something I have never experienced with another movie. As for movies with Vietnamese topics, I think it is the best, although the Platoon is second. Besides, I think it's also the best interpretation of Colin Farrell as an actor. I like him in most of his films, but in this case it was incredible. I gave her a 10 rating because it is one of my first five favorite movies.
