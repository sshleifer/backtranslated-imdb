An old adage: "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." It has been updated in recent years: "If you think you're in trouble, watch a TV show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave her a seven - it's good, but not great. It's a great way to lose 95 minutes, just as daily diffusion is published as "an hour in your life you will never come back!" All the familiar themes are here ... unbelieving spouses / friends, the wildest public on TV, the women who turn Jerry on, etc. The shooter watched Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweethearted characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") Trailer Mom and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as her equally villainous daughter, making sexual favors for almost every man they came into contact with. Men (including the staff producer) have been portrayed as quintessential tickets that deserve what they have received. I do not want to ruin or reveal everything, but the movie plays like the daily show. Here in Phoenix, he is shown back in the back for two hours every morning and then everything seems pale. Again, I give this film seven ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best administered in small doses for an hour.
