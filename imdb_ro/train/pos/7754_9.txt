Any way to blow the wind is Tom Barmans (who is also known as the front man of rock band "dEUS") debut film. Fully shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the movie starts on a sunny Friday morning and passes rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have many things to think, because most of the different story lines are left wide open. The movie has a piece of sound (purely instrumental) that will tear you down with your stockings. In most scenes, music really improves the overall atmosphere and feels, making it really hallucinating to watch at certain moments of time. The main scene of the movie, the party, is very well shot. The director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, having the main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I've heard recently. <br /> <br /> The script is a great thing. The angles and colors of the camera are very well chosen. The costumes are very warm and very "seventy". And I liked (mostly) acting. The thing I liked most about the film is the subtle, absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that intervenes. Without claiming to be a comedy (this movie is certainly not a comedy, but rather a piece of alternative art), it still manages to hear its audience giggling and even laughing at some moments. > This is the debut of a director who should not end. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future, because we had a good time. Luck.
