An excellent description of one of the most unpleasant aspects of that era. I liked visual - very suitable for a story related to a graphic novel. I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this, it happened very well that someone who was strengthened by his work (which he has not entirely chosen) but still wants to have a normal family life saddle. He does everything he can to see what's going on. You do not want to spoil the plot, but you have to see this movie if you're a person who wants more from a movie than the usual gangster-like action / action. (It is, however, violent.)
