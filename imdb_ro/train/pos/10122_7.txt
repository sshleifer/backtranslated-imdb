I found a little hard to follow as it seemed to sink in the middle as I tried to head or queue who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know a little about, and because we simply read subtitles in English, it inevitably loses some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seem to be too many only half-explained twists and coincidences. However, it seems unlikely that Miiki is totally bad, and certainly this is not the case. A lot of elegant and oscillatory violence, a window that fewer than Orthodox meet sexually, plus the family look. All in all a decent ride, but perhaps checking the story might actually be helpful before watching it.
