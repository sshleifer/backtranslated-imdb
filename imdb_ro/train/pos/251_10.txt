"Had Ned Kelly been born, he probably would have won a Victoria cross at Gallipolli." so it was Ned's Bravery. In Australia and especially in the country of Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta he is still a hero, Jerilderie's blood life depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they have not yet forgotten that the three cops he killed were from there. <br /> Many of the buildings he has visited in his life are still standing. From the old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged, at the post office, he kept in Jerilderie. A cell that was once held at Greta is exposed in Benella and Ann Jones's website, where he can visit the station and even the logs he was captured in Glenrowan. Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found throughout Victoria, in police records and even in the Sash where Ned received the prize for saving Dick Shelton from drowning. None of these things is wrong and what is left out would further justify Neds actions. The horse Ned "stole" was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man Ned left after leaving prison). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen, so he could not have stolen it. The letter from Jerilderie is more than what was said before. It is not an own justification, it is Ned's biography, a sketch of what he was and protested. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie, and then do everything in mind about what Ned was.
