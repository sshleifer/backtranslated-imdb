As a great fan of the original, we avoided this film as a plague when bad reviews began eight years ago, but we just finished watching this movie and considered it a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're looking for a re-creation of the original, you're in a big disappointment, but if you're looking for something quite different, a little strange and political, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school, where he is pursued by a college teacher and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When the student insists on meeting Gregory, there have been a number of shortcomings that include torture, breakage and entry, and all sorts of unexpected ups and downs that have made me feel excited and moved. If you look for something original, then I recommend this movie. I just want more people to see this when they are released and seen it for what it really is.
