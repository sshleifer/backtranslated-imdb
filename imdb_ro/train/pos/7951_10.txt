This is a very beautiful and sweet film that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat that are taken to live with someone else a while, but the animals do not understand, and they get away and go to find their family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about the life inside the pound. The shadow is the oldest and wisest dog that feels things. Put the three together in an adventure and make for a happy and fun time. There are no special effects of the mouth that move so that it is no cheese at all. It's the best animation movie I have ever seen. It's a great movie for families.
