I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on him, so I thought I was gonna check it out. I thought it was a very beautiful movie and can not wait to go and look at it again. the actors were very good and I loved all the music! there was not much talk in the movie, which at first felt a bit strange - but once I entered it, I thought the story and the act was really emotional and meaningful and thought she left a lot of imagination. I want to see the movie again because there have been so many things that I have forgotten many small things but I know I left the theater thinking about the movie. was beautifully shot and everything was truly unique.
