Movie B? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first movie? Yes. But aesthetic A +. This movie certainly had bad sound / editing / lighting / action / etc. and so on However, this movie has many positive things about it. First, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it was made to be a horror / funny B Horror movie. The comments the murderer makes to the victims left me and my friends rolling down the floor laughing. The problem is that a lot of people are trying to take each independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is, this is very good.
