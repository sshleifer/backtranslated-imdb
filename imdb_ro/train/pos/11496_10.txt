He loves this movie too. She saw her when she was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The film's hero hit the audience, and the discussion with Moritz Boerner has always been highlighted by the producer and director. In his genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent film. There are not many copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came out of the theater and made two short films and worked longer for television before he became a kind of therapist. For those who want to see the movie again, you can find it on its home page, which is not so easy to search for, but possible.
