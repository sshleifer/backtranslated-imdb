I like another 17 years from the first time I saw her, actually I discovered I lost this copy and I was really upset. Despite the lack of association with the original (which, as a child I have never noticed, and as an adult I do not care), should be those cartoons. Quite dark to be interesting and easy enough to be liked by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents have raised me more on this kind of stuff than on the cartoons we see today that have taught us nothing to our children. Music is great and it's stuck in your head forever ... I've downloaded the entire soundtrack at a time.
