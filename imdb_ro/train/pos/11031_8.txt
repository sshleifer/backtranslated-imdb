Sly's best action movie. It's a great movie, with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins' direction is assured with style. Stallone is rarely interesting in his action movies and certainly shows the part in terms of action scenes. It was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 1990s, a clear classic genre. Like a Stallone fan, this is one that I look back with pleasant memories. A lot of superb action and Sly in the form of a first-person man. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the features that make a good aciton movie. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
