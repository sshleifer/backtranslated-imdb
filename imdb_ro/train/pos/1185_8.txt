Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the good and bad roles that took place in "All Brothers were Brave". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad role, but Granger plays his role perfectly. However, the true hero in the story is the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly accomplished with the wonderful times of the time. The direction is tense, and although the movie is not at all pleasant, it's my way of thinking of an important film, unfairly ignored by cognoscents.
