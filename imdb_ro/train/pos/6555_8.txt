I read over 100 books by Nancy Drew, and if you're not brilliant enough to catch the movie yet, Nancy Drew was a Young Nancy Drew, not 18 years old who does not go to school that all of the books. That was when he was sixteen. So naturally, she would not be as intelligent as the one in the book thinking it was only in the tenth grade. Besides, I thought the movie was pretty cute. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was fun sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate in character and cute. I liked the embarrassment Nancy and Ned had around, for obviously they were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like books. It was a nice movie, PG that I enjoyed a lot because, unlike most people of my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
