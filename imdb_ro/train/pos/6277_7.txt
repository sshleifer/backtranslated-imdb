Good action and interesting plot. After seeing the original, I have to say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie. Good cast .. action significantly .. though it would be nice to see more expansion in the action scenes than the background story. Fun film to watch and keep alert all the time 7/10 is a good vote I think!
