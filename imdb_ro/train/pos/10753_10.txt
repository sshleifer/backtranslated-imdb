For those who say that this film deserves something under the unmistakable grace she showed it, I do not agree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. IMDB asks us to evaluate this movie. I beg you to think that the documentary was done. The courage that he took to shoot this film is the most notable. We find out that the two brothers are divided when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave, unaware of their safety and the rest. To judge whether it is more noble to film a moment of that tragedy or save the lives that amazing amazing firefighters have done is not mine to answer. I just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know each other. I'm sending you a total of 10. That's why the art of filming was created! To capture the natural emotions that real life offers. You can keep jungle kung-fu. Romanticism is nice. Action will never reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will be amazing by not being glorified. She did not have a hidden sight. He did not have all the noisy vanity that the lion binds from many films on many screens. It was class, calm, substance, and had a history of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. He talked about inevitable things in the eyes of the room. Please consider this film, as it proclaims itself, a tribute to all those who have fallen because of America's free and beautiful name. How can you give something less to a movie that looks, does not adorn the natural courage of real people acting in unreal moments. I love the "Godfather," but "9/11" is forever a different film because it is now a different world. It's art without questions or questions. jf
