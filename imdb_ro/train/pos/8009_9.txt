Ah, real memories. I lived in the Netherlands at that time and I looked forward beforehand every Sunday night and later on Tuesday. I saw her during the 14-16 years. Very good for my language (at school time) English, while the Dutch TV offers subtitles for other languages, except for children's shows nowadays. You have heard the voices and the original language. - The best series was the first three, and then after the third series, the great character, Nobel Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think they ever caught him, he has always escaped, leaving room to appear again in the next story), because obviously the series was also distributed in Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not go too well! Too bad that Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful, compelling job to describe the intelligent Nazi aristocrat who had this obsession to continue revenging on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high-quality performance in a number of youngsters, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good partner and the youngsters were so normal. I was very credible at the time and, like a child, I could have imagined being part of these young people, who at that time were four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, standing in my memory of those times as a special show with "Prisoner" as well. I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series, which would be great. Even the bad copies around are still nice to look at. The subsequent series was not as good, watered down and just not as fun as the top three. We hope they will also find the other Von Gelb series that will be released on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
