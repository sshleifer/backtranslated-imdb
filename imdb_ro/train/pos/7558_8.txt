This episode from the first season edges slightly to controversy with the whole bend kind. I imagine it would have been a significant amount of editing before it was finished to quench the censors' thirst. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well-written and directed is complemented by acting well. (Nicholas Lea makes the debut of X-Files, though not as a Krycek agent, but as a victim called Michael). I enjoyed it especially built to end in itself. <br /> <br /> Its different, but enjoyable.Ignore any bad comments you can hear.Watch for you and make judgment then
