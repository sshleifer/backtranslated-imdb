Marjorie appealing (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being accused by a lonely biker. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker forces his way to Marjorie's house and submits humiliating terror. Marjorie manages to take her attacker's hand up, beating the living light off the shore and making him helpless with his eyebrows in his eyes and neck. Jogging tied and beaten, Joe tries to explain Marjorie's teammates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There is almost a clue of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should he continue his punishment? Violence, sexual abuse, and tough language give a rating. R. Fawcett is really moving away from the roles that his career is forever losing. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
