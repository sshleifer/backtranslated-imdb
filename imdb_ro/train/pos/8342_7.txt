Pretty romantic comedy in which I do not think I've ever seen Meg looking for anyone. All the players did a good job to keep this a lively story. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician would take a look at fat monkeys, but that's why I like romantic comedies ... they can totally look at reality and have time. Beautiful movie. Hell, Meg is a babe, right?
