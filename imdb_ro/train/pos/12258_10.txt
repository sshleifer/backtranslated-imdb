Emma's Jane Austen is an extremely pleasant story in the worst moments and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with a good script and excellent cinema) manages to bring the comedy effectively, fails to make Emma pleasant. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for that part (and I think it was) and looks positively sick in the line dresses of the empire. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, directs the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of the heroes of Jane Austen) actually sees it. Mark Strong is a splendid Knightly gentleman with the right blend of beautiful looks, age, cavalry, compassion and gentleman's behavior. Emma and Mr. Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and overall production is quite delightful.
