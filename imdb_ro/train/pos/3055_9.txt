In his first role as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell beats a delightful yarn, representing all the marital problems related to melancholic authenticity, and thus swinging with a subplot so absorbed by the boys business. The film is harshly directed and consists of a wonderful script set together, as well as a quick and conscious family scenario (also by Brommell), which brings life to a genre otherwise tired. As a bonus, "Panic" offers subtle, acerbic humor - an unexpected surprise, undoubtedly charming and very welcome - through its mad, uncertain, low value star, whose coolness is always appealing, especially given the line his work. William H. Macy, forever, surprises us again as Alex, an unhappy, tear-up, middle-aged husband and father who finds consolation in the most dubious people: a 23-year-old young, called Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he meets in a waiting room at a psychologist's office, where Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) is waiting to discuss his growing desire to give up his family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built it. Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictator's father, strikes a false false to Sarah, which ultimately leads him to understand the irrefutable essence and responsibility of being his husband's husband and , more importantly, a good father for his six-year-old son, Sammy (played with enthusiasm by David Dorfman). Henri Brommell is brilliant "Panic" is rare in Hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of "Road to Perdition" in 2002, since his conception in 2000, he wears two conflicting genres (organized crime, family drama) a fascinating and warm film image that is uniform in both directions is one that will retain its exceptional, rare, and brilliant sincerity for the coming ages.
