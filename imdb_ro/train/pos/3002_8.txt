The "Kennel murder case" begins to run and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reasons to kill the victim, and more people tried. William Powell is wonderful as Philo Vance, the gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing like the niece put-on, who just wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance. This movie comes associated with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disc (or check it out of the local library), do it. It's pure fun!
