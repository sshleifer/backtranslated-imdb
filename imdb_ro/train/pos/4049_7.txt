Erich Rohmer "L'Anglaise et le duc" makes a perfect piece of Peter Watkins' La Commune (Paris 1871). " Both films - written at the International Film Festival in Toronto this year - illustrate ironically how history is modelable by story-makers. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the US during the festival. Set in Paris during the French Revolution, the film, based on Grace Elliott's "Memoirs" (Lucy Russell), is a film a first maneuver about how he survived those unfortunate but dangerous days. She also details her relationship with the Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, unlike herself, is a supporter of the Revolution. True in shape, you do not know whose part of Rohmer's history will descend. One of the oldest French filmmakers, "New Wave," Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the midst of the youth-Vietnam-rebellion days of the late '60s and' 70s, he filmed small romantic clothing such as Claire's Knee. But do not sell the old man, good people, he has always been a student of a human nature, not an ideologist, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues to bear this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never "bad guys" or "good boys," are primarily human beings capable of presenting a full range of human potentials and boundaries, so his films are always provocative , and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now for the nuts and the technological screws. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, though heading for the '80s, is still on top of cinematic innovation. L'Anglaise "is something you have never seen before. You guessed it, the old man - like some of the festival's directors this year - has become digital as if it were taking place in the original places the Parisians of the 1780's. In fact, you might be so entertained by the increase in the authenticity of the film's appearance that it has to return to the second screening to catch the subtleties of the psychological film - and yes, I'll say - visions Toronto presents some of the most talented young directors this year, as well as some of the oldest in the world.And the old masters sit there on the edge of cinema cutting even with the young ones.It lives in old age and lives long Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
