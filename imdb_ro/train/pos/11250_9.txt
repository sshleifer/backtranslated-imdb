Just when we saw the mini A Perfect Spy series in one movement, nothing but a hat - a pure masterpiece, which, compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley, has different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the minis about Smiley, it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the other actors just support him, it can be said. Here is an important ensemble and story, the lead actor, played excellent by Peter Egan in the final episodes, is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan plays only a guy called Magnus Pym, who, by eating, being puzzled and telling people what they like to hear, is greatly enjoyed by everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, the Czech handler. <br /> <br /> The car has never been spied on, and / or the traitor has said better! After pursuing life from an early age, we fully understand what makes it possible to turn it into a traitor. His ability to lie and to forge everything makes him "a perfect spy", as his Czech manipulator calls him. <br /> <br /> And, watching her life, we fully understand how difficult it is to turn the straight and narrow path once you have overturned it. He lives, even if he never gets anything economic, except for promotion by MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy as long as the flow of fake information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played awesome by Ray McAnally, is a poor man, always dreaming of schemes to conceive outside of their money. In recent years, his son has to save him again and again. But by the example given by his father and uncle, who takes over as a guard when his father goes to prison, and his mother is sent to a shelter, Magnus quickly learns that the lie is the way to survive without telling the truth. At first he exaggerates a little, but he learns quickly to tell the right lies and to be constant without changing the stories from time to time that he tells those who want to listen to him and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech worker Alex, experienced with Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of absent informants who provide the British MI5 with false information for years and years, just as they did British Spies Britons who were active in the UK before and during the war - continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been transformed, liquidated or simply replaced with MI5 men. young people who play Magnus in the younger years make it wonderful, and most are more charismatic than the oldest, cynical and tired, Pym, interpreted by Egan. But buy the difference easily, as it is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to pain or indifference. Really worth the money!
