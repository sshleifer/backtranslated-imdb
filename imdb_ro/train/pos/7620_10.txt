Lost is the best television series in the world. First time, it has GREAT actors and wonderful directions. Writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after Season 3 the writing became extremely complex. , who is Jacob? Why are polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think writers are lost and have raised many questions and mysteries that they can not explain. I think these people are wrong. I trust the writers. I believe that if the mysteries are revealed, all the charm of the series will disappear. In any case, lost is undoubtedly the largest television series and will continue to be for a long time.
