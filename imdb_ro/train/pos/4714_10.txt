The famous words of the owner of the foreign nightclub Roman Maroni, the "cork full of cork", who spends the entire film not only as a rival to Johnny Dangerous, but also slaughters English. Another undervalued classic that you can find in the late afternoon or "late late", Johnny Dangerous is a tremendous satirical hit about a good heart boy who secretly leads a life of murder to help pay for medical care his mother and put his brother through the law school. br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A distribution that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what's going on. There's too much laughter in it to put you here. Like Airplanes, you need to be careful or you'll lose something. Highly recommended anyone can use a good or two laugh!
