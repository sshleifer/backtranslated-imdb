The goal to start! Gunbuster is one of those series of anime that has a classic text written everywhere. I really enjoyed this series and until today my favorite anime remains. And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. First, as a parody of 1970s drama, "Aim For The Ace", Gunbuster takes steam as a serious drama towards the end of Episode 2 when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive her father's death, who was killed in the initial encounter of mankind with the insect race that a humanity has in war. Because of his father's death, Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence turns out to fall sometimes and she gets confused. Her boyfriend, Kazumi Amano, has doubts about the choice of Noriko as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, trusts her. He made his personal mission to see that he managed to become a pilot, being a survivor of the battle where Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot designated to serve with squadron Noriko, and Kazumi belong to Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first fight together with Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's boyfriend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, because while Noriko is out of space, Kimiko lags behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of time-expansion, Kimiko ages normally on Earth, while Noriko is relatively the same age as when he left school. By the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old, while Kimiko is in the mid-fifties. Overall, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of the giant mecha robot and Gainax animation. If you like other concerts by Hideaki Anno or you are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.
