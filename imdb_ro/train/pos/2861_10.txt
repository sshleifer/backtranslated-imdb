I like this show and my 11-year-old daughter loves me looking at him together. Teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and fun way (though with a somewhat predictable story, most of the time). It's also fun to have fun with ... you know, scroll and enter your own dialogue instead of the actors. "I set my DVR to record all the episodes and it happened to me capturing the end of an episode to start the next ... so I do not know what the episode was), but there was an absolute TERRIBLE SEALING error! Adam gave Sheriff Coffee a small specimen of "skin" that was broken off a as he tried to make his getaway I think Roy had his coat so he put it on his desk and put the exact example from where it was broken The specimen was EXACT rectangular ... about which I think that it would be almost impossible to break out of a piece of skin (the post-1950 naugahid, yes, leather, I do not think) Well, the swatch is perfectly aligned and the mystery has been solved, not after 10 seconds in the scene the coat again, still on Roy's desk, but this time the specimen was more like the North Carolina form and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was bent in the middle of the swatch) is now gone ... the same like the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh as I played the short scene over and over and over again! It's great for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love the show, and sequencing errors make a lot of fun!
