This is a short movie made by a fan who pretends to be a preview for a new movie that paired Batman and Superman! It's kind of a movie that fans adore and watches in places like ComicCon and was made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. As for this movie, I could easily pick out. Of course the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was done on a frightening budget, and for a movie a fan is incredible. I was particularly impressed by the very Superman boy - he was not a weird guy! If it was just a preview for a real movie, it should have made fans come from here to Omaha to see it. Good job.
