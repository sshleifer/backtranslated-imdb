I have this movie and have watched it several times over the years since it was released. The Prince does not amaze us with his phenomenal style of acting or anything else, he is a musician, and he feels that he looks like he is here, it is best to tell this story by influence. Most of this film is simple and teenage, but this is the mistake of the directors / writers, yet it is a great movie with even better music. The moral principles and beliefs of the purple rain are quite strong, and if more films rely on the basics we teach as little children, we will have a better environment on all sides, seeing that art reflects the life that reflects the art.
