I liked all Cream work, even though there is such a small and precious work catalog to keep it. Even when it takes up to twenty minutes, some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples), the socks are still on more than half of every rock act today. This gel power on stage has one of the most anticipated rock band meetings with their Royal Albert Hall shows last year. Perhaps they have grown older, just like their fans, but the energy is still there, with the wonderful arrangements of classical blues songs as well as their own. The expansion of the White House, the Badge, the Politician, the Spoon, the Sun of Your Love, none seems to miss a rhythm. Clapton's solos have a band he sometimes does not have on stage with the solo band. Ginger Baker, he said enough. Jack Bruce is pretty robust, with his voices still with a power that Clapton could never do alone. Bottom line if you want to see the best shows you would have seen last year (well, some have seen them), it's all on this DVD with special features.
