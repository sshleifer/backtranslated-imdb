I heard a few friends one day saying "Scarface sucks ... an idiot tried to make another God put in the early 80's." I usually listen to idiots / I see CNN, so I decided to stay away from her. Then my colleague gave me the DVD and said "This is # 1 with pelicangs", confused I tried it. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all these nonsense about stolen car races that are too expensive for someone in that area to afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There's a bit of humor though ... that is Pelicangs and 80s light music. What's better than Al Pacino with a m203? I give this a ***** of ****, perfect for Al's fans or GTA: Vice City.
