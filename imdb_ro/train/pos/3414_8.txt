This interesting documentary tells a remarkable story of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children traveling to the Himalayas; but also a confrontation of personality between two remarkable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest and the team of climbers visiting children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman leading the first school for blind Tibetans who agrees with the expedition but still has doubts about how they are progressing. At a certain level, Sabine simply does not understand the mountain philosophy (focusing on the summit); she is probably right in identifying the mismatches between the objectives of the alpinists and the wishes of the children, but her certainty in her fairness makes her a hard person to feel, especially because she has an effective veto. In the context of this collision (reasonably well-maneuvered), we have a perspective on the life of the children themselves. I liked the film, although it offers a message clearly designed to be exalting - even if it details the argument, the film unusually states how amazing everyone is in it. But it is hard to argue with this assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer to some extent.
