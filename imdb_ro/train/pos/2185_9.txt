Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who has lost his muse. He has forged some time, buying his lyrics and music from various sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (Mary Martin words) meet to meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they did. There are complications, but everything is corrected at the end. Crosby and Martin sing terribly. Mary signed a Paramount contract and, at the same time, doubled regularly on Radio Crosby show at the Music Hall showroom. For reasons I do not understand, the movie audience did not take it to her, so she returned to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. Basil Rathbone in one of the few times played comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly deflated by the officer Oscar Levant and once again they are surprised that they have not made more films together. Like most of Crosby's Paramount vehicles, there are no big numbers of production, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title song being made as a jam session in a pawn shop. A good job of all. A surprising plot of original and fun.
