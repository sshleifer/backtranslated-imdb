As a memorable movie collector, I had to buy the film poster for this film, which, now that I finally saw it, must be the best thing about it. There is nothing more appealing to hang on the wall than a 27x41 inch picture of the melting man. However, there is nothing more terrible to put in the video than a one-and-a-half-hour image of the melting man. At first I thought this movie was pure garbage, but then I realized it had certain qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most admired person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so nice that it's unbelievable! ("It's incredible It looks like it's getting stronger as it melts!) And can anyone tell me how it will be how loud I know exactly how long Steve left before it melts completely and exactly what is the plan to help him? If this movie had to scare the audience, I think he missed his appeal.
