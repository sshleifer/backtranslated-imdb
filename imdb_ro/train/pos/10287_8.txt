This is one of those movies he has promoted too much. If you look at TV, then you better not watch the movie. Almost all fun scenes are spoiled in previews, except for those that happen to be Jennifer Annisten being fun. It's a typical Jim Carrey humor and it's very funny. You just do not go see this movie waiting to be surprised. Generally, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies, you have to see this, otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as happy.
