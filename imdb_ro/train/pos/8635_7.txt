"California" is a good Hollywood Odyssey of Suspicion and Terror that tells of two couples who lead the country to California to share the cost of gas: a pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character, which is the focus of this thriller somewhat predictable. A good watch for those in the psycho-killer.
