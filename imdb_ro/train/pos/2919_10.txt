I've seen the movie twice in the space of a week, both in a movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times, and people had to come back. Since the beginning of the film, when Henry Winkler was "hurt" on the football field, the whole audience was full of laughter, laughter that lasted until loans. For those who love American fights this movie is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen before. You are also looking for a well-known actor, whose fight is a head-but!
