The latest installment in the action thriller franchise is just the biggest shot of the three films. It goes on to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his unclear past. Everything about this movie strikes him from angle from cinema to choreography / stunt for the script to act. The film starts in a thrill when Bourne runs from the Moscow police. The story seems to rise right where the first movie ended. Or not? Time is a little terrible, but we realize that Bourne remembers things. A quick blink while trying to clean up almost gets him, but he does it and does not kill anyone. I'm not his target. From there we have more intrigue in his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy returns as well as Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past with Bourne as well. The cinema is in front of you watching almost everything. Chase is even more intense if it seems possible than the ones in the first two. And Bourne's veteran cast is superb, with a beautiful part of Albert Finney. It also has a slight political emphasis on teaching and other government policies, but it is minor and well integrated into the plot. Overall, this is the best conclusion of this year's trilogy, if not the best trilogy ever.
