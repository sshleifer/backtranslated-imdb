This is a fascinating hunting show for the first serial killer known in the Soviet Union. I walked into waiting for a half-decent TV movie, but I found myself drawing the convincing way in which the story was told. As others have said, it is much to be admired here, which, unfortunately, is lacking in many big screen shows. Much of the credit should go to Chris Gerolmo, whose smart screenplay and direction draws the spectator in is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The actor is also superb, especially the two leaders, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their compelling portraits give their character a lot of credibility and the scene in which they had the first committee meeting after Perestroika is really touching. If you prefer crime movies with a bit more depth and a bit less shiny, I recommend you to look at Citizen X. <br /> <br />
