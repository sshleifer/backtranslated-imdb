What is really sad shows that Six Degrees and Brothers & Sisters are reality reality TV, not garbage that is nothing but glorified gaming. I think the stain of dissatisfaction has been there in recent years, with the very premature cancellation of numerous shows with a next worship. But with more vocal reaction, Jericho's fans (which we enjoy) and other shows, networks can start to reverse this trend. They are like others, I will not support any new show until a second season is given. Then eventually I will make a decision to watch and catch by watching DVDs and online. Until then, ABC, you've lost me as a spectator to any new show.
