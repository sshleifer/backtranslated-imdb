"How to lose friends and strangers" is a superb movie. A hilarious film from the beginning to the end. A wonderful funny. I liked. Thumps Up! <br /> <br /> Performance: Jason is fantastic. It's a treatment to look at it from start to finish. Jeff Bridges is excellent as the boss. It's a legend. Megan Fox looks amazingly hot and offers good performance. but dude, it's so hot! Anderson is delightful. It does not look at all at all, still hot. Kristan Dunst looks great and does a pretty good job. Others are also pretty good. <br /> <br /> "How to lose friends and strangers" is an excellent entertainment artist. Do not miss this move!
