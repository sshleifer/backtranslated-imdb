"Der Todesking" - Jorg Buttgereit's second long-lasting feature film (the first notorious "Nekromantik") has no central character or character, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide. a series of set-pieces, each of which presents the self-destruction of a complete alien. Yes, the production values ​​are low and disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. Makes you think sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other works by Buttgereit, it is not very bad, but there are some unpleasant images such as the scene of castration in the Tuesday episode, a broken corpse, and various suicide acts. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressing and painful - even amazing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10 - check this post-modernism shock! Distort the art in the purest form!
