I loved this movie very much when it was released and I still do, because the story makes you feel full of hope about life in general and people ... one of the things I love about his films Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes in the film, there are other reasons that appeal to Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a remarkable cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for Best Picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon lets you feel positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. We'd choose Grand Canyon over Crash on any day.
