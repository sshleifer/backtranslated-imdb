What is "Freedom of Cry"? It's simply a great and unique experience about South Africa's realization and how black people in that country have been repressed by white men. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he critically discusses Steve Biko's (Denzel Washington) views. Soon, Woods meets Biko and changes his mind about him and begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (even from above, even from the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides he has to write a book about him and that no matter what he has to publish. But Woods has to escape from his country to publish that book and have to put his family in second place so that the world can find the truth. Attenborough managed to make a good film about people, with the main message that black and white are the same, because we are all people. The story takes us to South Africa, and this movie is a great way for the whole world to find out what happened in that land and I am disappointed that only 3,200 people have appreciated this film. This is the movie from which we can all learn something. Though it is a little too long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way because the director wanted to show us how hard it was for Woods to get that book published after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Woods and Biko has been wonderful, just like the families of the two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death), so the truth could be discovered (Woods's book).
