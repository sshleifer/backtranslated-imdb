I saw the real crime when she was released for the first time in the mid-nineties and I watched it several times. It's a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school in a California city that is the younger sister of classmates, tortured and murdered by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how brilliant she is and decides to work together to try to find the killer. Many suspects in this case. True murder feels very "real" or real to me. I read a newsgroup review, in which somebody wrote that there is the total suspension of unbelief here and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, like the other actors. Locations are directly on the spot and writer / director, Pat Verducci, really surprises some of the teen's life's realities and Mary's loneliness (see scene where Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after seeing the photos she took from Tony). I want Verducci to make more movies. I have not seen any other film quite similar to True Crime. 10/10
