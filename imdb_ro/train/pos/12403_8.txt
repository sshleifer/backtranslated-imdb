You would have forgiven me for believing that a Finnish director in Helsinki would not do well to lead an American horror movie (especially one that is entirely in a US prison) - see this to prove you wrong! It was produced in the 1980s and the film was made in a more appropriate budget for a modern television commercial (something that one thinks one would notice nowadays, which are almost all accustomed to $ 100m + budgets for movies acting unfortunately dominating the industry of the mind!) is Harlin's major production and - at least what he would today consider a star show. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the cinema industry has more to do with the screenings of Stellan Stargaard (not to mention Mr Bergman's directorial efforts) - at least for all female viewers - proves that there is no film talent outside the US and Hollywood to make us watch a suspense movie. Try and watch this movie, even if you are not a fist of horror, IMO definitely deserves!
