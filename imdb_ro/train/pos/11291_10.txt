Was anyone able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not Reel), who is seen throwing his wings in the air and then pulling his fist while giving him the pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He's just on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like to have the movie. He was killed in a struggle against Italy, he was only 24 years old. Do we know the movie studio that did it? Or did anyone see her at a video store like Blockbuster? I want them to make catalogs of these old movies available, because it's so cheap to do DVD these days. Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where to buy a copy. Thank you.
