Hidden Frontier is remarkable because it was the longest series of Star Trek series on the internet. While production quality is not on par with fan productions, such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier is largely focused on the story and, in doing so, it does really well indeed. Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead of actors are filmed against a green echo, and digitally introduced backgrounds. One of the greatest achievements of the Hidden Frontier is the great amount of work they have produced. One way to do this is to insert virtual sets at the time of filming instead of postproduction. While this saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the resulting images is not as great as it would have been produced in post-production, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> While there may not be a whole cup of tea, Hidden Frontier deserves a chance, although it would be better to start watching the third season, because here manufacturers are starting to hit their feet.
