A Chinese Chinese story tells young young man Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a tax collector he wants to spend at night in a deserted temple where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang ). When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for the evil spirit of trees that feeds on "chi" (life force), he decides to try to free the girl by offering him a proper funeral. By defeating Swingman Yin (Wu ma), a mad taoist monk, Ling successfully defeats the spirit of the tree but must also fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, to whom Tsing is about to grow up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first Hong Kong movie I've seen is not just a martial art action, the Chinese Ghost Story has opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy, a magical kingdom, hosted by beautiful female ghosts, wearing tahoe monks, monstrous spirits and dark gentlemen of the underworld; I instantly fell in love with the exuberance, energy, humor, inventiveness and visual excellence of the film. Two decades later, and this amazing film still remains one of the best examples of his genre that I've seen? - a sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that combines superb horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With a superb direction from Siu-Tung Ching, an excellent edition from David Wu, a stunning cinema and lots of imaginative special effects (including a killer killer language, a tentacular monster and more flight heads!), An experience completely unforgettable and completely enjoyable from start to finish.
