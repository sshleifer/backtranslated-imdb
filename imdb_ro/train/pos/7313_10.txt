Some Spoilers If you're a big fan of the horror movie then you'll know Halloween has paved the way for many filming movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this film is a true classic horror and is certainly one of the most scary films ever made, if not the most frightening. I saw the movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I have seen the other 7 movies honestly before I see this, so it worked. But I should say that this blows everyone else away. It's really scary, and seeing Michael stepping out of a bush or walking in the dark, sends a splash on the spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael buries a guy and tilts his head to one side. It is one of the most erect images in cinematic history. Later, songs such as Friday's 13th films were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a frightening bastard, because it's realistic, you could imagine a crazy guy like killing people. I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching him for several nights. What's great about this movie is that it's not based on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just a pure terror. It's too bad for the later movies of the show to get hurt from it, because this is just as good and an example of a spectacle of slasher while coming.
