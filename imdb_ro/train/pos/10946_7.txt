Do not listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitterly injured since the roast that Silverman gave to Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and pretty nice fit in an Adult Swim line. If Silverman cancels the "doodice" jokes for minors and accentuates the darker and subtle underground of the show, so far we can say that we could have one of the biggest cult comedy from the "Strangers With Candy" canceled. But it's only solid, not remarkable, unlucky / musical comedy, but potentially huge. <br /> <br /> Silverman created a hilarious character-a younger version of Jerri Blank, the most beautiful, younger, American princess of the great Jerri Blank, and the show features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotyped portraits of a gay couple I've ever seen on TV. Previous reports suggest that the following two episodes outweigh the pilot, so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds.
