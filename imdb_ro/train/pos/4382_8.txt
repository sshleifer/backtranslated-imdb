Shaded by "Braveheart" released in the same year, the two dramas of costume begging comparison. I admit my bias towards Mel Gibson, yet I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy". Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" accurately describe Scottish history in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic story of individual honor and courage and a delicious revenge fantasy. It is also melodramatic, anacronic and maudlin. Keep in mind the use of cornball for slow motion filming. His violence is both ugly and glorious. This is the second quality that makes it more appealing to the teenage mentality. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" at high levels of massacre (not to mention his time of forbearance), the last film is ultimately more mature and more satisfying. Its action is more subdued, but more surprising and smarter. His sex is less spectacular, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. His dialogue tries to bring the poetry of the period closer. His rotten teeth from the mouths of the actors try to approximate the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a super villain. He also recommended "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You can find the latter more like "Braveheart," with a focus on blood appetite, with the first one more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the above films deserve the R rating for violence.
