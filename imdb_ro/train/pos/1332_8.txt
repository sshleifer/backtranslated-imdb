In 1594, in Brazil, the Tupinambas are friends of Frenches, and their enemies are Tupiniquins, Portuguese friends. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by Tupinambás and, despite his trial, to convince him that he is French, I think he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave and marries Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he uses dust in the cannons that the Portuguese have left behind to defeat Tupiniquins in a battle. To celebrate victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is shot with natural light most of the time and is very realistic. Actresses and actresses get naked, and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and amazing performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by the Europeans, focusing at that time on Portuguese and French, the Indian trade and the exchange of combs and mirrors through our natural resources. This film was awarded at national festivals such as Brazil's Brazilian Cinema Festival in 1971, Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) (Régis Monteiro); São Paulo Association of Critics of Art (Ana Maria Magalhães) and other awards. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" ("How Delicious Was My Frenchman")
