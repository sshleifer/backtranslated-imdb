I had no idea what the film is doing. As I recall, I accepted the information that was then presented in the media: a confusion about a dubious personality: Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr.Chavez, but all who came to the picture were important and, ultimately, the reality of that entelech: the people were overwhelming. Thank you, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain
