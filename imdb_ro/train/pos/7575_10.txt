Resident Evil: Veronica code is a well-done video game, it has excellent graphics, very comfortable controls, an excellent story and a fun factor. Claire Redfield's story is taken on an island to enter umbrella territory and react to chaos at them are the main lab as she searches for her brother. The Veronica graphics are very good, the fire and the rain effects are very look.The controls are comfortable , but the button pattern does not match Dreamcast control, making it hard to get it. Still, the fun is going around an awkward space, pulling the courage from the zombies. Code: Veronica also has a little "romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. The sound of this game is better than ever, for example, although I hate the new feature. When the giant spiders crawl, their legs make a disturbing sound, and the guns sound more realistic. story, comfortable controls and real sound sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica a definite lover. I give him 10 out of 10.
