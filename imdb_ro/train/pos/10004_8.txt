This is not comedian Robin Williams, nor is he crazy / crazy Robin Williams of the fame of the recent thriller. This is a classic drama drama without dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love with the thriller. But it's not a thriller in itself. This is more of a mysterious vehicle / suspense by which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his goalkeeper. Also, with Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, Drama Suspense performs pretty much like a news report until William's character gets close to reaching his goal. I have to say that I was very entertained, although this film fails to teach, guide, inspect or amuse. He felt rather like watching a guy (Williams), as he realized the effects of the action, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story. In total, it's worth a watch, though it's certainly not the price on Friday / Saturday. /> <br /> Evaluates a value of 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
