I thought this movie was fantastic. He was hilarious. He remembered something about Spinal Tap. This is one thing you have to see for any fan of 70-year-old rock. (I hope my friends and I are not that good in twenty years!) Bill Nighy offers excellent performance as a lead singer who tries to recover that old spirit, Stephen Rea is fits perfectly into the film as the adhesive that tries to keep the band together but fails well. If you like music and you've ever been in a band, this movie is for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know I'm not doing this. Even my family was funny and that says something.
