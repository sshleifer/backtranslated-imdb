This is what one of the girls said at the end. Is the football game a metaphor for a skill game between girls (or broader, a free thinking group) and authority? "In Germany" means a future that is hopeful? It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experiences I've ever had - despite the brutal cinema and the plot, and a slight over-acting (although I like the song - I'm loving and well on top of it waiting for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I feel that deep frustration is denied to a game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can not think of how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is not a section of women in which protection against dirty language and bad behavior can be provided - overcoming the wrong reasons for denial. The film is very clever - the amazing title of shooting during real-life, spontaneity and various ways to put the spectators into character shoes - the game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown), the enticing light and joyful sound in the stadium, the closing van, and its uselessness when the ones inside connect with the crowd celebrated outside. I can feel the comfort that comes from the radio, drinks and food and of course the kindness and consideration of each character to others. During the end credits, I'm amused that no character has a name - it's just a "soldier" and it's just any "girl" or "sister."
