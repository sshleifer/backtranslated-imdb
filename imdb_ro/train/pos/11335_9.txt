Jake's closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer, combined with the imagination of Pan's Labyrinth. Even the beginning of the special effect seems to give a blow to Pan's labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war of sixty years ago, and in this way it has more resonance today. Jake's closet is about a boy, a single child, virtually alone in the summer vacation, which deals with the fall of his family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sense Six, a horror movie for the person thinking. If you are looking for a slasher movie, it will not be a cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is so moving and suspenseful, with good acting, this is the movie for you. At the screening I've seen, I swear there was a time when all the audience screamed. We strongly recommend taking this movie.
