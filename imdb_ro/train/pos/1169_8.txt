Elegant, heartfelt, innovative vengeance-driven revenge. Also, cheese, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. He reminded me a lot of "The Big Heat" because he has the revenge plot triggered by exactly the same event, and the girl returns to the good boy's side because of the same bad behavior of the bad guy. It's sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but it's so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could anyone be as beautiful as Alain walk around a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? However, he is very tough and frozen. No one can touch it nowadays - though someone like Jude Law might try to believe it. It's hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were many excellent car chases (and these are generally not my tea tea) - especially one of nilly willy in the woods. People have also met their paws creatively and bloody, for example, in a cat's dick. But, beyond the cheese, the global atmosphere has affected and has been removed. More creativity, emotion and freshness in the movie "forgotten" than most of what we have seen lately.
