This film contains a single ingredient that all the revenge movies should have and which is the real excitement. Sorrow, love, laughter, rage. There are so many emotions thrown into this movie. From the beginning to the end this movie is extremely exciting. Land on paper sounds like rubbish that is mostly thrown into the audience, but it is not wrong, this movie is strong. Washington, as always, has great performance. Short story: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life to him, children become kidnapped, man wants vengeance. It does not sound like something special, but it is far superior to any other similar movie there. For the moment, TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare both, MAN ON FIRE wins his hands. Characters engage and everyone makes tremendous performance, and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, it seems like the city of Mexico, smells like Mexico City. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. style of direction was something I liked and brought the best in Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you will bring once a year to look again or a the film you will begging your family and friends to look at. From the beginning to the end he roots for the main protagonist, making him a roller coaster trip. There is enough action to make you happy, to enjoy enough development to please you and then to bring you a smile on your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
