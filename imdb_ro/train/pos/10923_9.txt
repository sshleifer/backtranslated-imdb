This movie is very good. The plot, which acts as a puzzle, causes viewers to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings many surprises and makes a spectator really looking forward to solving an enigma. The battle scenes are very good. There are a lot of different fighting styles (though one of the styles was a bit unreal to me, but it's just my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating. The only thing that could be irritating is the actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung-fu films especially in the '70s and' 80s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is an excellent choice.
