Before losing everything that was shown on television was predictable. You could predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you could not predict anything. Everything was so surprisingly amazing and it was really a mystery not because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. I have become literally addicted to this. LOST is a classic art work. It offers something to be expected every week. He's a genius. The surroundings are brilliant, calm and warm at the beach and so frightening in the jungle. The characters are a genius, each of them, especially those on the island. The rides are so drastic, but we can never predict death, because they have much more to do and more to say and have secrets that affect the other caves that die with them.
