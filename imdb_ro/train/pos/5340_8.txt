Clara Lago is wonderful as the main character of the movie, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moves to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. Apparently my mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first an uneasiness for her, then they get close. The movie is beautifully shot, bathed in soft colors for the most part. Carol wants her father, who is a pilot at war, to feel the love he has for him. While the war itself is a way to take a back seat in this movie, it encompasses the lives of the character. I think you will like it. See especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job like Carol. She is certainly one to follow.
