10 out of 10, this brilliant, super-documentary must be seen with movie clips of war that people have not seen for years until this was seen in 1974. The film filmed in this war documentary does not rate something, some clips have left my mouth. The whole series has over 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story about the war. Simply this is probably the best war documentary yet, and now over 25 years old is still able to pack an extraordinary blow. You have to watch this at some point, even if it's a few episodes, even then you'll still be amazed at the impact that this documentary has on those who have suffered and died in the name of the War in a world at war ..
