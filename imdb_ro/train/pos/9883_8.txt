It had 8 seasons, but it was the first in early 1959, and is the last one in the autumn of 1965, shorter than seasons 2-7. CBS Chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show in Season 8 in September 1965 because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor who left after Season 7. The latest new episode in November 1965. The only CBS broadcast in 1966, on January 4, 1966, was a repeat. <br /> <br /> I often wonder why Rawhide did not go to color filming for last season? Most westerners in the 1960s were in color until 1965. CBS broadcast in autumn colors for many of their sitcoms, but Westerners such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained black and white. Gunsmoke was the last West (and the last time to turn to color) on Sept. 17, 1966, for Snap's episode decision.
