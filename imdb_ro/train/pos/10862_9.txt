The choice is a Chinese movie, or triad in this case. Every two years a choice is made for a new leader and at first he seems to throw a play between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai or, as I know, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who he was in full contact with the judge!). Although once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes to any length can to get recognition as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie they watch with gangsters, it is not a movie of action. It has bloody moments, when necessary, like in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are a lot of characters, which is very hard to follow, but I think they play a little in this madness. A 100-year-old cane, which is the power symbol I have mentioned before, changes hands several times before things get quiet. And although it looks like the movie ends at 65 or 70 minutes, it still has some big surprises. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and some kind of anchoring the image. The election was quite the winner of the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning for best actor (Tony Leung) the best picture, the best director (Johnny To, who made Trio Heroic!) And the better scenario. He also had nominations for cinematography, editing, film score (which I loved) and three other shows (including Yam).
