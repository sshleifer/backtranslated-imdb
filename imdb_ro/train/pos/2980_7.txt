This movie is just funny. mindless but funny. to fully enjoy this movie, you can not have a perception of how such a movie is going and you enjoy all the jokes and decks that are involved in the film. I still find the little funny when it says "she wants a beer ........ cock". Funny stuff. but what makes the decent movie is that it does not try to make a serious movie hard, too many comedies try to have serious issues that you just do not believe. But this is different and focuses only on being fun. I have to say that Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the three main guys, coop, remake and squeak are very fun to watch and make the big movie to watch
