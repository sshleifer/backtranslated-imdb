I love Sabrina the teenage witch and I've seen each episode. I remember when I stood every night at 18:00 and expected to come to Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left the high school, the show began to descend. The best series should be when she was a friend of Valerie (I'm not sure what it is). From there, the next series (Dreams' friends) was still very good, but when he left high school, he did not look good. All the main characters seemed to have gone, which meant that she did not have as much old "shine" but the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and can be noticed, however when her dandy leaves and Sabrina move in their home is not fair. She is no longer a teenager, so the show's name is not fair and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh, the show does not seem right, especially when Sabrina marries someone who is not Harvey. Thanks for coming in the last five minutes of the last episode to get it. Generally, I like to see the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Witch, but I think the writers have gone too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show certainly lost some of his magic
