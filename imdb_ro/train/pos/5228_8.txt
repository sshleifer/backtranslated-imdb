I found this hilarious movie. The parodies from other popular films of that time were some of the funniest things I've ever seen in this type of movie. Try. If you've seen the movies that this movie falsifies and you get the humor, you should enjoy the movie. I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler because I will not tell you what really happens) was a scene with the "flashy thing" from MIB . When he first discovers the device and does not know what it means ... and then again later in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. My only complaint about the movie is that I have never been able to find it on DVD so I can buy a copy.
