Oh, this is such a glorious music. There is a bit of miscasting - Frank Sinatra is extremely miscast as the Jew Nathan Detroit, though it only becomes evident on "Sue Me," which is a distinct Jewish song. Unfortunately, the directors decided to cut one of the best songs from the show "Marry the Man Today" and replaced it with a lower Sinatra performance. With these two deficiencies in mind, the film is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing valuable beans, but he does. Stubby Kaye repeats greatly the role of Broadway (it was written for him). Damon Runyon's tongue, rhythm and humor come pretty well. This is in my list to see-all-chance-get them.
