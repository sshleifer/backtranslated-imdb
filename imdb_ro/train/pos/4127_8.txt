I know there are some purists there who can not say anything that is not exactly the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is quite similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time cares for the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things with flair. The iron chefs themselves are very interested. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet, but Bobby Flay is the only American iron chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun when cooking, making comments and clicking during the creation. I watched the series and found that all the players are working together. However, judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, such as a lawyer turned into food, but most judges are questioned about the ability to manage what is served. I like to watch the cheer of the cooks and the provocators are surprising. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps it is everything anyone can ask, want to really eat what is served. The only thing I really would change about the series is to ask people from the show to make them a little easier. Sometimes your mood gets a bit too tense and it's not always fun to watch when you have more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was as big as the original, but I can say it was a pretty expensive proposal. I would have liked to stay with this version and have been the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, that will grieve me for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can accept this series on its own merits, you can consider it a pleasant time.
