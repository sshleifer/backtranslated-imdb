In fact, I did not start looking at the show until FX came. I was bored and had nothing to watch and I saw that the rerun of the show was awarded, so I decided to watch her. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it was broadcast for t.v. I liked the show so much! Finally, a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were good shows but they are not funny. They would joke and laugh at things that were just bad, but not from the fact that it looks like 70 years. The seventeenth exhibition was hilarious, intelligent and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm really sorry it's over. Although I like this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso are leaving. The last season was not fair, Eric was the main character, and the show would have ended when his character left. I still like this show and I hope TV starts making more shows like this one.
