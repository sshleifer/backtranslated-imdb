Kurt Russell is so credible with the action so uninterrupted that he must think of him afterward to realize that there were important themes ranging from honest to kindness [overcoming the fear of the Stranger, learning to rise above the early conditioning, friendship can bring, etc.] into the story. This is so rare for a "guy" action that even I [who thinks most A / A is a violent pope] liked the movie and recommended it to every guy I know ... .. is a shame that was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the greatest hits of action adventure adventures - it has something for everyone without falling in love or losing moments action almost non-stop. I'm afraid the answer to this is not a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. Anyone under the age of 20 has not only seen violent actions in their video games, but it probably will not catch the multi-themed beauty with many themes or does not care. This movie could convert anyone who avoids A / A as a mindless violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents her or sees her in a list of cables] to see this movie, she'll be more likely to get her to go with other action.
