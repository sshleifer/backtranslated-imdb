it's not as good as the first movie but it's a good solid movie, it has good scenes of tracking the car, on the remake of this movie there's a story because I'm a hero to drive fast as his attempt to rush to the side the sick wife, the end is great, just a fair movie to watch in my opinion, <br /> <br />
