Unlike HELLO's version, DOLLY! From Tinseltown, Jay Presson, Ira Levin's adaptation of Ira Levin's thriller Broadway screen could not wait to close his closing stage before putting it on the silver screen, so the producers decided wisely to take full advantage of the White Path ! The opening and closing scenes of the film are filmed inside New York's Intimate Music Theater, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the final fadeout of the movie on the theater is a version of the famous stageplay logo. (Although marketers have decided to go with a Rubik's Cube icon for the movie). Now, on a discounted DVD, DEATHTRAP looks as fresh and inventive as ever. The distribution is just as good (better than their stage counterparts), and location scouts should be applauded to find a scary home suitable for "room, two actresses." In a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely labels any "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin's evil evil center alone. The last scene of the movie is a major Hollywood departure from the panels and slightly undermines one of Levin's Story earlier in the movie [Helga (about a dagger): "They will be used by another woman because of the game"]. Like Robert Altman's OUR PAGIN, our new final helps the film to turn itself back on itself and blur the lines between the scene, the screen and (could it be?) Real life!
