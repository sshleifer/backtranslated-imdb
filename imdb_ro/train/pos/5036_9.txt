Bill Paxton, Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator's fame, surprises me with his debut as director of Frailty. He strikes all the cylinders, but there is a near-endless incomprehension involving the FBI agent (Powers Booth), which cancels a point from this chilling otherwise and considered a thriller provocative. Besides, this movie was fine. Bill Paxton plays dad. He never gave a first name, but that's not a weakness of the movie. In fact, he strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of a kind. He has one day vision that he has been sent from God telling him that the world is approaching the end and both he and his two sons, Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter), must fine the demons and kill them. Demons show that the normal people they kill, and this makes the miracle of visualization if Dad has just lost his mind, or he really does the work of God. There are scenes that reflect the two points that add to confusion and gives the film more suspense. The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and talks to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and right. After all, it's not everyday that someone comes to your office to tell you he knows who the killer is. The film has numerous ups and downs, and Bill Paxton leads splendidly by keeping our guessing without losing interest. The actor is incredible. The two young men also lead Paxton the big thing together, looking like a normal family, even if they are all involved in the crime. As I said it is an improbability that involves the Powers Booth character, but it really is not a big deal. This was an extremely well-done film, involving faith and family.
