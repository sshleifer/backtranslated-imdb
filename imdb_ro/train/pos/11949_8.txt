Woody Allen's second film in London. Thing Tarot Card Murder kills prostitutes in London. The aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) receives advice that might be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). He starts to tell him, but he falls in love quickly. She helped script writer Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what she sees. I like this better than last year's "Match Point". It was shorter and moved much faster. The land is old, but I was entertained and kept trying until the end. It's not just a comedy, it's a mystery with some very good comedy lines (all of Allen, of course). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's a lot better than the worst. The actor is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times before and became exhausting. But Johansson and Jackman are wonderful - they look great and give two very attractive performances. Also, Allen (surprisingly) works on their sexual attraction - there is a sequence in which both are in swimsuits to show their beautiful bodies. The only real flow is that Allen still seems uncertain about how London has fired. It's not as good as Match Point - maybe it'll be better as it goes on. It's worth seeing. I give her 8.
