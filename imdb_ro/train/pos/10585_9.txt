Footlight Parade is among the best of the 1930s extraordinary comedy. A great screenplay and exceptional cast, including Jimmy Cagney, the wonderful Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this film a cut above the rest. Directed and choreographed by creative genius Busby Berkeley, this movie will make you smile from ear to ear from start to finish. Of course he is an indisputable master of Hollywood music with "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" as a director (Dance Director). The Footlight Parade is decorated by hundreds of precious house choreographed girls, a Berkeley brand. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with a single room, and Busby was the first director to shoot close to the dancers. His obsession with legs in shape and "back" legs is demonstrated here. The overall effect is extremely erotic and fascinating. Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of short prologs or short musical productions that were played in cinemas to entertain the audience before talking. He is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a golden girlfriend. Although Cagney had a solid background in Voudeville, it was the first film in which he showed his talent for dancing. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's secretary. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. The film culminates with three remarkable production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of which is a masterpiece and is not likely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinema. Claudia's Bottom Line: Clever and erotic, with some of the best music production numbers ever made on celluloid. An epoch full of pleasure in the age of Depression.
