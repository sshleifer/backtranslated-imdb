He saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q & A afterwards. It was hard for me to think he was a director for the first time, and all the kudos of Harvey Keitel again, assuming a risk and coming out on a script for a script he liked. Surely, reminding of Cinema Paradiso, he tells of the young director about the Cuban revolution. However, do not expect this movie to be a film about the revolution, its political position is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the love of directors in the history of the film (a great homage to "Bicycle Thief") and some capricious scenes that work without being pretentious. Enjoy!
