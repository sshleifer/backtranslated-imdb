I saw the Shadow of Brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved them! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from his release in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother died and embarked on a journey to slowly repair his alienated relationship with his brother's wife and child and his father who never forgave him as the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to deepen the complexity of their lives. Also, the image of the Woodworking and Brooklyn backgrounds sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
