From the first five episodes of the short Hammer House of Horror series by Hammer, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "The House That Was Deathly Damaged" is undoubtedly the strangest. Like a big fan of "Gothic Horror" films from Hammer Studios for many years, I wonder what took me so long to start seeing the show quite recently. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes and I have a strong feeling that the best is still to blame, but even if the series remain as fun as the first five episodes are, I will be pleased. While the second and third episodes were wonderful to look for a morbid and ingenious sense of humor, this fifth entry is surely the one in the top five that offers the most authentic horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife for unknown reasons. A few years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move home with their daughter, Sophie (Emma Ridley). Immediately after he moved, the family must find out that there is something terribly wrong in the house, which is apparently haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his previous mediocre entry, " Increase Pain "(Episode 4), and strangers are good performers. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinema and score. "House Suffered to Death" is a solid episode that provides the elements that my colleagues Hammer fans would like to see in a short horror story. The film offers a creepy atmosphere, true moments of brawl and smart twists and it's suspense and fun from start to finish. Generally, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
