I remember seeing this movie many years ago, I think, BBC2. I'd love to see her again - does anyone know how to get a copy? As I recall, it was a particularly powerful film, especially the scene that stands out is from horses that carry gas masks. Besides, I can not remember much about the story - that's why I want to see it again! I shot the internet, but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. I appreciate any help that anyone can give me in this regard. Thank you very much in advance for your assistance. Sincerely, Albany234@googlemail.com
