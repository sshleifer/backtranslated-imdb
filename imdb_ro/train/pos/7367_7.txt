I am currently studying film at A.S. and "it's not a love song" is a movie I've been watching and, in my opinion, is a very simple story, but a complex story. If you scratch the surface, you will find a thriller-chase movie by two men traveling around the country from farmers after committing a murder: "it sounds pretty out of the ordinary." However, you need to get deeper into discovering the real sense of true genre. As it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of confidence, deception and betrayal. We are not told about this direct "love" through the film, but the events that take place outside, for example, the way Heaton acts on Spike, almost calls out this love affair untouched in our faces. Generally, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "garbage" just because they are made at a low budget. A good film with a sophisticated story, however, is certainly an acquired taste and may not be suitable for the average Hollywood box office fan.
