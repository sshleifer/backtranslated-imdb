I did not have much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the master story trilogy of lower affairs, but was fired at The Flock and was replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I had the feeling that Lau did a good movie but did not satisfy the study, so they fired him and hired another director. Usually it does not work well (remember the Invasion). But the Fleet was better than what I expected. great movie, but it's an exciting and fun thriller. The development of the character is very well done and I could know the characters very well. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances. , let's go to the negative points. An element that really bothered me (it was a moment I was irritated) was the excess of tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style. Their presence is arbitrary. Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious. Despite this, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not memorable at all, but it's fun.
