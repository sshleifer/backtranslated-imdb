Of all the films of the seventies, none were captured at the true essence of the good fight against evil, as did the Sentinel. Yes, there were movies like the Exorcist and others; but none of them captured the protagonist's human element like this one. If you have time, check this out. You may not be able to overcome dated devices as such, but this is a story that is worth intrigue. Then there are all the stars and stars that will be soon. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle indices that lead to what is happening. Be very careful. I had to look at it four times to capture all the stranger claims, such as "black and white cat, white and black cake". In addition, the books are really good. I'm sorry they will not turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary he's going to overcome this movie.
