I thought this movie was funny LOL. It's fun, not to be taken seriously, a movie about the twisted views of a man about life, love and ... well, ladies "from the lower bus station to the high-class d√©butants ... the bus station Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a Playboy-style mansion by a figure of Hugh Hefner-esquire, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses.When his "father" gives him out on the street, he has to learn to deal with himself with nothing but a chauvinist perspective on the life the young man has taught him - and that is an incredible and almost mystical level of charm and luck, and so begins the hijinx! you have seen this movie and you enjoy a fairy comedy / love story, half-minded, then I recommend to rent the "ladies man."
