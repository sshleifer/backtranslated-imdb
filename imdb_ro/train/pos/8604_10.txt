I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I think it's adorable. I can not say much, but the movie is a movie that feels good, I think. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many funny lines in the movie, especially as Briggitta learns about things and not about society. If you like music, I would say you want this!
