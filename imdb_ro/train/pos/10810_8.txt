Very beautiful film made. It's not in memory. Better billed as a love story than flying or war, otherwise the flying parts are realistic and almost error-free. Flying buffs like me will enjoy this movie, even if they are attracted to airplanes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. Fun we were watching early Crowe. He is good and exudes the charm. Flight High's reading is gorgeous
