O.K. Who brought the cheese. I like. During her time it became a phenomenon. Anorexic twins have become popular. Bob Saget began to make a salary (instead of his stand-up VERY funny). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was humor and always brought a good lesson. And here I'm different from the norm: I liked the last seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children become older, there is more to do with the scenario. That's why I dare say ... She could have gone much later than she did. But anyway. I gave her 8/10 because of his healthy, funny lines, and because of Bob Saget!
