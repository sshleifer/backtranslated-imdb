John Van Druten's hit hit on Broadway is brought to the screen with the ultimate power of stars in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch who beats a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart could get top taxes, but Kim Novak is the one who steals the show as one of the most appealing witches ever to spell on the screen of the movie. The lead pair is actually one of the few weaknesses of the movie: Stewart with gray hair looks a bit old for the role, and while it's easy to understand why it's hard for Novak, it's a bit harder to understand finds it appealing to him because they seem inappropriate in temperament and perspective. (It is one of the funny stories of the story that witches and neglients are portrayed as beatniks and bohemians in Greenwich Village.) Curiously, the association of Stewart-Novak would generate much more heat in the "Vertigo" launched in the same year as this movie, but then "Vertigo" had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The comic moments of the film are mostly provided by the star cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (Kim's Warlock's brother), Elsa Lanchester (their aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As awful writer. Hermione Gingold appears even in a hilarious cameo as a kind of Grand Witch. There is plenty of pleasure in this movie - intelligence, love and a great cast - that is, if you can get your eyes off Miss Miss Novak. I've seen the movie a dozen times and can never.
