I remember seeing the movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw it. Probably I was about 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wanted to see it again. He once came to Kung Fu, but I missed it. I was really bummed. This is the best Kung Fu special effects movie I have ever seen! I strongly recommend, and now that I have discovered where to get it, I can rejoice for once and for years. I also have to watch the movie "The Return of Venom," about which some have spoken so much.
