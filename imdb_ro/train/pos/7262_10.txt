My daughter, her friends and I watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little girlfriends were hiding. Later I rented it so many times. It never ages! Blockbuster no longer has their list and tried to buy, find it, rent it for over 5 years. Undoubtedly, this was and is my daughter's most favorite childhood movie ... she has everything! I laughed, I cried, we talked about real life, and about how hard some children have in the world. Nothing was claimed about this movie. We've referred to every second and every Bill line! We thank a million for the restoration of our faith in human nature. Frankly, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man? or a man who has love chooses to raise a child that is not his. Maybe it's not my life or mine. It's not just credible, it's happening every day. Thank God! Keep my belief in human nature in my life! celebrate !!!!
