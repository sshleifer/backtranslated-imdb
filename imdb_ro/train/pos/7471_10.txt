Despite the remarkable trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be disappointed with the movie, because I heard she did not get great reviews. However, I left the cinema entirely, so amazed at how good Vanilla Sky is. There was no bad action in the whole movie, every character is credible. The romantic moments of Cruise's character, the character of David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia, are realistic and intimate (probably because they were a real-life couple). The Vanilla Sky plot will make you disturb the last third of the movie and there's very little chance of guessing the end. However, the heads are tied to the end of the year, leaving you a strange mixture of feelings that consist of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. The film is intellectual and must pay attention all the time. This is not so difficult, as there are chances to be fully attracted to the film and not take your eyes off the screen for a second. They usually leave cinemas forgotten about the movie just watching. But Vanilla Sky still persists in my mind days after I saw it. I recommend it to all who want a change from simple and superficial films.
