As a child, I liked this game. I played a thousand times in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it, we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And I quickly forgot that it really existed. You played as ex-policemen Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who gave up force to take the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work in a ruined and corrupt town led by Mr X's evil. Beat all bad guys and the boss at the end of the level is much more fun. Level 4 (Bridge) was my favor, because you could swallow bad on the holes in the river. You even have the chance to become Mr Right's right man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the head of the union. Just as possible this is a mystery since you destroy the union on the way to Mr X, but you do not mind. Streets of Rage also has a really fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro has done absolute wonders with Sega Genesis's limited technology. The main theme, Level 1, Level 4 and Boss Final, are exceptional songs. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does somehow make the first somewhat outdated. <br /> <br /> Pro: <br /> <br /> Medium graphics, but beautiful backgrounds depicted in a comic book as progression of the panel that fits the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great melody. <br /> <br /> Easy to enter and difficult to put down. <br /> <br /> Very inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of Rage 2. <br /> <br /> The weak enemy. Baddies often go away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially angry with Level 5 chief. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo moves. Lack of decent weapons. Bad patterns are repeated too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B - Sound A- Gameplay B- Last Call B-
