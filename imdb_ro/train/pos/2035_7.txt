Well, I'm going to go against the grain on this movie, so it seems. Being a self-confessed horror fan, I sat down on this without knowing exactly what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes, I actually got up feeling scared (quite rarely). Obviously, the movie has a small budget and is set around the charging station, but the lack of money of the movies does not distract the story's attention. Yes, the story is a bit uplifting and does not explain it very well, but CREEP is a class act and advances in cutting and dismantling anything. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! There are some pieces of the movie that you have to close your eyes to or at least your legs! you will understand when you see it. All in all a good movie and make a change to see a good slash movie that actually scares
