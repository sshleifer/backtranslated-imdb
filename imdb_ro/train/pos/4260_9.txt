After Fatih Akins worked for the first time, "Im Juli", which was good enough, he created a superb epic of the Italian family. It is a German film, which, unfortunately, is a bad precondition, because rare produce more than moderate films;). But this movie makes some very good instant snapshots of time. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the Ruhr region of Germany in the 1960s. The immigrant and family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. Characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling you make. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Well, you do not believe her role. But the character is well-balanced and fits perfectly with this scenario. I feel the urgent need to compare the style of this film to the "Na≈üul" style. Many people will probably hate this movie, they say boringly. Not too much tension? - Yeah, but a scandalous movie. 9 of 10.
