I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded it while I was looking, so I could review it later. I enjoyed the second view more, since I managed to absorb more of the intelligent dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the way this story evolved was very challenging. I was very interested in how Natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends, at first seemed to be saying a lot of animosity, but once she started to interact more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit will take place. I was not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets Sara kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a faulty human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter they, in a painful manner that sometimes you really love someone you have to give freedom to. The viewers who have stayed with this movie to the end have seen a very moving interpretation from Diane Keaton (which is always great, even in some of her less well received films - think of town and country). The closing scene of Diane Keaton's leadership was well on hold, revealing that anyone who loves another human being must learn that we must live our own lives, love others, but we do not have them, and ultimately have to let go. It's a hard lesson, but it's worth contemplating from time to time. Thanks to CBS for this show, it's worth the long awaited.
