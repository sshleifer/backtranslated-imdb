I was quite surprised by this move. Even if they were obviously unimaginative, you have to be impressed that this movie lasted seven years and turned out to be good. The actress was quite impressive and the story really caught me. My only complaint would be that the end was really a bit too steep for my taste. But if your audience remains more than this movie has succeeded. I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Ríos, who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now all bad news on acting). Antonella Ríos is truly a rising star.
