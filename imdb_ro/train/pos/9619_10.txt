OK, so a 10 for a 2Â½-star movie you're asking ... you see this well and maybe it will make more sense. Hitchcock has never mixed up better scenes together ... The movie wraps the scenes together without blemish from the beginning, and yet you do not get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie leads you through the many characters you are trying to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and that I do not disappoint you when I do. The writer / producer of Phil Hay's surreal story, mixed with an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack, makes you think more about 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie with the same title ... I'll look for more good things from this producer in the future.
