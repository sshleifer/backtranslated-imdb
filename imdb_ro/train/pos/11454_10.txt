Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while and holding books, I had some expectations about what I would see. What I received was something completely satisfactory and much more than I expected. Being a single artist (working in clay), finding inspiration in the environment to make good art is imperative and is something that Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. Following him in a year, the director captures spontaneous energy, skill and devotion to nature-related artists with a dramatic call. The music set for the film is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, then SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Creating, dancing, struggling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
