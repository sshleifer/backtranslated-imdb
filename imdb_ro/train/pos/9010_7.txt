A bit strange and unpleasant; but smart enough to be worthy of being watched. A young, wheelchair-bound Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is along with a reticent caretaker, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who is loud about human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and plans to fly him. He wants to revive his own disturbing life, taking care of Jane's dying, independent, suffering from a neurological illness that has just left the motor skills without words and very little. The seat in the trolley and full of spirit, the last wish she desires is to lose her virginity. It is offered to Richard, who will not help it directly; but he is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this ambitious and humorous move. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
