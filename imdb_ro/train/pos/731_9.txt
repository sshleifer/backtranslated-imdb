This movie is SOOOO funny !!! The actress is WONDERFUL, Ramones are sexy, jokes are subtle, and the plot is exactly what every dreamer dreams of doing at school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack, as well as carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This movie is a tad bit "greasy" esk (without all the annoying songs). Songs sung are pleasing; you may even find yourself singing these songs once the movie has passed. This musical is number two in musicals for me (second to blues brothers). But please do not think of it as a musical; seeing how songs are so enjoyable, it's hard to say that a carefully choreographed scene takes place. I think this movie is more of a comedy with subtleties of romance. You will remember how it was to be a rebellious teenager; you need to remember the old days of high school after seeing this movie. Highly recommended both for the family (because it is very young, but also for adults because there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
