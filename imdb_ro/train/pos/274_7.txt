I look at most of the films that Nick Mancuso has, because sincerely, I love the guy, even if he is older he is usually expressed as baddie (long-lasting fans should notice that for some reason blond in this movie). It's a pretty familiar film in terms of plotting (but then most of these days are not really original), but Rick Roberts is thrilling that the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac, is as appealing as the daughter, and Mitzi Kapture makes a good work, if it were her purpose, to be mad and sometimes hard to like. Nick nevertheless managed to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place outside the screen - such as motivation, past behaviors, good times and heavy times - and things that seem obvious to the characters never do good to the audience (that is me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the category "But what do you say ..." and, as a whole, I can not say I cared too much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was - a reasonable way to spend the afternoon - and still like Nick.
