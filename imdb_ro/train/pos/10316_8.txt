Remember these two stories with love and, first of all, set in the not too distant future, we see a boy preparing for the day of the exam, the state test i.q. The boy is a little bit puzzled about parental anxiety because some of his friends have already done it and eventually leave to do the test. On arrival, he is given an injection and is curious why. The examiner smiles and tells him that he just has to make sure he's telling the truth. Then the boy asks him again, why not? Later, parents are waiting to be worried about the screen when a message appears and states that the state is sorry, but their son's level has exceeded the national coefficient and politely asked that they would like a private funeral. A lighter of a final scene! A message from the Charity was a heart-warming story about a psychic relationship between a girl in the past and a guy in the present. Which creates a strange story of witchcraft accusations in the past and is heading to today's history pages. A beautiful story with an unimaginable conclusion.
