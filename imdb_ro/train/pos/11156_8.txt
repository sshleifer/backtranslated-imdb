I usually do not like reality shows, especially those who take advantage of the success of "American Idol". But with whom I can live. Comedians around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and, if they like it, those guys will be sent to make a routine for an effective audience. Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a home together and to make Survivor-style competitions using comic tactics. Then one will be determined as "The Last Comic Mode." I like to sit in comedy, so this is the show of reality that I have to like my interests. There are usually some funny comics selected by. He started talent careers like Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. My negative criticism is that there is a possibility that many of these comics have been selected for their contribution to drama show reality. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother," but now they have turned away with this, thank God. And there are a lot of comedians I felt, they were chosen just because I'm weird, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, and so on. when other comics had to beat them. But, overall, it is a reality show well done, which are two terms so far, I thought it was an oxymoron.
