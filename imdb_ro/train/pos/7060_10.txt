Many people commented that this movie was not as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not - for you. However, how does the child react to him? Well, mine loved her more than the first. Disney movies in the past can sometimes be a little harsh for young children. (For example, Bambi's mother was shot.) This movie was great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy ending. If you want to be snobby about what Disney-based standards should be - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft-hearted little boy, you really want to pray, buy this movie and treat the little ones. This movie is great as a movie for bedding for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that I love my child and does not have to impress parents all the time.
