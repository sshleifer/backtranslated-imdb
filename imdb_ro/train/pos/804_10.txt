No, there is another! Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II, and III, and because this opinion was biased because we lost so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I'll tell you the good points of the "Jedi Return" and some negative points of the prequel. Of course, I liked the music, the special effects, the two droids, but that was discussed too much elsewhere. What we get into the original trilogy and in this particular film: - Strong ecological concern - Anti-militaristic positions - Fascinating perspectives on the Jedi Order and Force - Cute Creatures - Harrison Ford's Smile - A Killer Scene: Finally, when Vader looks alternatively to his son and emperor. The lethal screw light is reflected on his black helmet. And when he takes him and betrays his Master to save Luke, he risks his life! Oh, boy! What is wrong with the INMHO prequel: - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast has managed to push forward is somewhat lacking - Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than wisdom - Too many Jedi at one time and too many Saber Lights on screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot By the way, if you enjoy the theory of Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read some books about Buddhism and the forms he took in ancient Japan. Star Wars, IMHO is mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to an apprentice, from a father to his son, though the difficulties. "De mon tme a ton" (from my soul to yours), as Bejard writes to the young master Zen T. Deshimaru.
