This movie is much better than the asylum version, mainly its war in the world. Tripods look great, but walking and death could have been better. The action scenes were very cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... God, stop to go, or I will kill. The scene of the thundering child was my favorite sequence, mainly because a ship picked up a bunch of tripods. A good movie I recommend for the people who read the book. The music is great and the cutting of the directors looks pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Translate to ... 99% Good Soundtrack For Book Cool Violets Tripods and handling machines are great to look at <br /> <br /> Cons. some things that looked heavy in London
