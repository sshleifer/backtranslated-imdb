I loved this movie absolutely. I bought it as soon as I found a copy of it. This movie had so much excitement, and it felt so real that I felt a lot with the characters. Every time I follow her, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip and how I would feel if the same thing had to happen to me. I think all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will prevent people from doing the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and to anyone. Especially those who have been affected by any shooting school. It is truly one of the greatest movies of all time.
