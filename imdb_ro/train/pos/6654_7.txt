The film took a new step to Gandhi's life, which is beautiful to see and show how human it was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi has been upset about, and has mentioned it several times that his failure as a father in his autobiography. My big flu is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly non-artistic in the movie. It could have been better done by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smart and seemed to have been deliberately presented in negative light in some parts of the film. The film is not totally round, the relationship between father and son. The rest is unclear and is only used to show the time frame and overall movie setting. General movie, if you have in mind that it's not a complete picture.
