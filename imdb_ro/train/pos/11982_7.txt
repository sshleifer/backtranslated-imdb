That's how I feel about the show. I started looking at the show back in 2001. I enjoy the show, but it made too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> MAKE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERELE! <br /> <br /> Steals story lines from old TV shows. They even stole from the "Partidrge Family". Then in 1 episode, the "Partridge Family" was mentioned. Actors playing different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn, most notably, did this, especially when she played in 1 episode. The character Michelle CAN NOT make a joke, but then they have this kid to revenge her sisters for a joke on her. <br /> <br /> Lines of story that came and went in 1 episode. Joey got the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard again after that. Danny played the guitar at once. 1 episode he is soccer coaching, 1 episode he is coaching softball / baseball. 1 game and you're out Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey continues to get jobs very quickly, without experience. Just in a TV show. I liked D.J. And Stephanie characters. The desire that Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had a clean, adult life.
