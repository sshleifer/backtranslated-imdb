I saw this movie about a week ago, and I still think about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very credible and sympathetic to a guilt. As in real life, though sometimes people are disappointing, as in the case of Leo, who, although I liked his character, would not have been disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex, even though he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed by Leo for rejecting the drugs he had and terribly treated Marcel when he decided to take him home on the train. I think this film has shown in a very real way why the HIV number rises to gay youth. This is by no means meant to blame homosexuals (I am homosexual), and a very good film could have been made about a young, right-wing person who makes bad choices and does not seem aware of the consequences on himself and others. The only part of the movie I could not understand was the reason the family (homosexual) did not want to include Marcel in Leo's disease until he was allowed to go to the funeral. the biggest message in this movie is that, whether it is homosexual or direct, NO SEX IS NOT PROTECTED!
