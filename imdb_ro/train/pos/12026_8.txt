I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so accustomed to seeing it now in a sitcom and I hope that a TV station will actually show this TV again because it will show Sabrina fans that MJH is shining in a drama. She saw how we tracked Sabrina now 5 years ago, and so give the audience a taste of much-unused talent as a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in her parents' desire "done away" so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina spectators will notice, Melissa is working with David Lascher before assuming Josh's role as Sabrina. So it would be a kind of care to see this when it is broadcast again. We hope MJH will have good roles in movies or even in several TV movies, such as Kellie Martin who has always shone in TV films. A lot of unused talent waiting to bust when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa!
