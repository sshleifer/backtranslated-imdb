As others have said, all women who get bored in this movie are absolutely gorgeous. This plot only shows the hypocrisy of female libido. When people are around, they want to be watched, but when they are not "men" around, they become watched by a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a man very quickly (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then becomes the courage to follow true love.
