Everything does not even approach the sum of the parts. No problem. This film features a number of creative directors of today and some well-known names in the cast. Segments are conceived around the same theme, "Love in Paris," but the likeness ends there. In fact, considering that the approach to the theme from these different directors has so many shapes, it is amazing that we can even feel that we are still looking at the same movie. No great efforts have been made to turn it into a whole. This buffet has so many wonderful ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one dish.
