Young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother offer an extraordinary fantasy in the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "La increible y triste historia da la candida Er√©ndira, ..." can not rub Marquez's bearers correctly, even if the story remains intact and still bears the full force of the work. The power of this film is in his action, especially Papas, as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices alike will enjoy this film for its real brand of witt pebbles.
