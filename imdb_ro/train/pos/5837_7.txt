With Oliver Hardy worried about the sound of horns, bells, telephones and thrombons, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with an excellent solution, living in a dockside boat, so the sea salt air can help Ollie get the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the mad traps to appear, as the boat is ended by a hungry goat and a prisoner who has escaped (Richard Cramer) walks for a walk. I have a shot from all the gangs in the movie, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - "Silence While Men Men Working". The early story of boys' apartment presents a series of unconditional movements in water and plant installations, and Stan makes a banana inside a banana. Laurel has some wonderful lines in the picture, such as "We have to be disconcerted," but the one I ran was his response to the ship's killer - "Self-preservation is the ultimate law of the media" just! I'm not as much a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this forum, all I know is that I liked it as a child and I thought it would be just as fun today as they are back in youth. At that time, "Saps At Sea" offers a decent hour of hornofob fun, well on the way to Hornomania.
