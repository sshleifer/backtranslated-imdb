This is one of five animated features of Disney, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length animation film (as opposed to 40's compilation films), and the expensive depth through the multi-layered camera does not return to the movie in any other way. Although Disney adapts the story to a certain extent, it adds the idea of ​​the era through dress and style setting - a clear time for the story to take place. Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are somehow well developed, except for the Prince - left the flatter - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's all. Like Christmas White, Disney has a permanent impact on the story of folk culture - in most versions of Cinderella, the screenwriters are appealing, not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character takes them away from their otherwise beautiful looks. > <br /> Favorite Disney favorites: mice! She also appreciated continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoes throughout the film. Adding homemade gown as well as the following aggression from the steppe was always terrible as a child - I remember the Master viewing this with a black background and a big red light on it! The ruffled trousers show that bad lady Lady Tremaine does not want to give up Cinderella and admit defeat - Audley will continue to characterize the worst of all Disney villains, Satanic Maleficent Sorcerer, in Sleeping Beauty.
