I would like to comment on April Love. It's one of my favorites, because my dad, Nelson Malone, plays the horse coach. I remember very clearly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where I lived at that time to make April Love. Dad was in many tracks and he was a talented man. I told him to try one of the bit bits offered, and here he came home with the script. How interesting this is! Also, a number of colleagues were in crowd scenes - especially those presented in the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown again, and the April Love song by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Weather and reminds of a long time when you see the movies I'm doing today about sex, language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies, like Love in April ...
