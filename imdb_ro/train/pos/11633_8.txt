Red Eye is not the kind of film that will win Palme d'Or, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and his branding is a good indication of what a filmmaker can expect. > <br /> <br /> The fact that the red eye is a tiny, impressive packet of 94 minutes is part of his charm and is an indication of Craven's boat in producing light but generally pleasant tickets. In fact, it's a perfect way to film it to look like outdoor entertainment without attention, without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the spectator. In general, there is a strange feeling about the plot, the vicious sub-plan of terrorism motivation and support characters, and the main section has a TV movie feel. However, there are clear elements of Hitchcock's suspense and echoes of Schumacher's phone house, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and demanding) play within the same emotional crisis that is played suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting on the seats, lives or dies on characters and scenarios. Ciprian Rippner and Rachel MacAdams, Cillian's director, are the most important reasons why the movie is away. Not only do we do the zing dialogue, but we also offer a kind of Adam's Rib dimension to fight against "male logic" against "feminine" sensitivity. In the last part of the film, Craven complains a bit of Scream style as man-chases-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation is what Brian Cox looks after "Just for Men", his ubiquitous appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers, Ring and this makes him the sexegen version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Fun for short distances.
