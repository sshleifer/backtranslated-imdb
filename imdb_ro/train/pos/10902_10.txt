I was very moved when I watched the movie. How John was able to keep his hope and faith was amazing. so many people only care about what they want and agitation about all the things they do not have. and there are so small things like clothes, money, a new car. I saw people in tears because of a blemish. this movie brings everything back to the basics. love, hope the beauty of simple things, but so important in life. makes our day-to-day problems to be seen for what is small and truly irrelevant. you look at this boy and you realize that as long as you have been blessed with food, a roof above your head and your loved ones. You are truly blessed. and says that the smell of roses really has a new meaning. I know jonny will see this and I want to thank him so much for sharing faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you for knowing that you lift up the heavens and bring a lot of love and laughter to heaven above.
