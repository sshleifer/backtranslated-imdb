The superb quality of the stars of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this comic full of spells, fun and huge, with a bunch of snake and goblins. Pretty happy in his story, impossible to resist. A cute romantic comedy, with a very young woman, Gina Lollobrigida, as the love interest. A movie will be remembered with great affection.
