You have no illusions, this is a morality story. Granger is the troubled ex-bivol hunter, tempted back to the plain once again by killing Taylor. Granger can see that the end is approaching, and he feels profound for the cost of hunting - the flocks, the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, equates to the killing of buffaloes, or to the Indians, to be "with a woman." While the role of the hunter tortured Granger is superb, Taylor is the one who steals the show as a man demented, "immoral" immoral and damned for pocket quickly and for good. Not too here, but the story is moving fast, and we are being treated for a beautiful performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is as daunting today, as in the relationship between 1800 and man with the earth and what is on it, and racism. Considering when that was done, the censors should have squeezed their hooves in the "bloody house" scenes, Taylor's relationship with the scandal, and much of the dialogue. Though it is unlikely to be, it is truly a great Western image.
