Why did not manufacturers give that chance to destroy all the benches on TV, why do manufacturers have not given the chance of six degrees? Will the series go on video? I'd love to see how it's over. Put a season on the video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and I waited for him to come back. I set my recorder to record all the shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and that my heart was broken. I want to know it will be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show had just developed a certain depth in the characters. The writing was also good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite of all time. I'm sorry to see it go!
