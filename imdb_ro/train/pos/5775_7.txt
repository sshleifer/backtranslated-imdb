Give it to people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's an extraordinary movie, with cheese, action-inflamed by evil and two wonderful hills that add to the schlock factor. The two boys to rent boats are the movie! LOL, and you'll like the boat scene where the English guy and his wife talked about all the stars and it's noon and sunny. Bloody hilar! You can tell him they do not care about the plot, but they just wanted to explode the filming as soon as possible. Bottom line, you'll love if you love those 70 years.
