As I always wanted something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it was just another "B" movie, but I was amazed at the action of the two main characters. All the actors in this movie were very capable and well-targeted. The land was wonderful and unique, as well as an excellent moral of the story. This movie is certainly not for someone looking for a romp, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and courage. This is an extraordinarily painful film that presents some grim reality of life, accompanied by the human heart's goodness and enough frivolity to keep it interesting. I'd prefer this movie to many "A" movies even saw a large number of box office winnings. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
