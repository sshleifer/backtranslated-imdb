George Lopez is a funny man even without a sitcom. The first episodes I've seen too often make jokes at the expense of her mother. As I watched more, it was more and more varied. No one on cast is safe from his wisdom now. It seems to me that this season has evolved that George feels more comfortable with the role of the father of the family. At first it was not, but he gets more and more into a groove. This makes him and his performances even more fun. They added some characters for George to play this year as well. His wife's father is becoming more and more involved in the plot. His mother is still there, but not as central as the past seasons. I think it's prudent to say George's comedy feeling and the lack of good sitcoms of ABC, George Lopez has the chance to be here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
