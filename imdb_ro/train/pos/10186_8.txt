Okay, I know this does not promote India in a good light. But the overall theme of the film is not India, it is Shakti. The power of a warrior and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go really bad. The interaction between Nandini and her father in law - the power of her dysfunctional relationship - and her changed lives are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be just a cameo compared to Karisma Kapoor's credible despair. It is easy to get caught in the love, violence and redemption of life in this movie and find yourself feeling a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. Musical interludes are strong, credible and well-done.
