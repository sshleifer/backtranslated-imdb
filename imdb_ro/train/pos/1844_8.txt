I was not quite sure if this was going to be just one of those idiotic night soaps that seemed to cling to the main time, but, as it turns out, this is a fairly good show (not least thanks to the talented casting). Four female friends with different backgrounds gather and share the weekly events of their love life. The one hour program follows each of them separately, through their often misleading searches, to find love and does it without being boring or tribune. "Trudi" from Sharon Small is a family member (presumed to be a widow after September 11) who has little preoccupation and annoyance over her friends (who tend to be less free and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see Small back on tv because she was wonderful in "Lynley Mysteries Inspector". The chicken can act. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) is probably the most afflicted, but still very sympathetic, of women, while struggling with her husband Hari (Jaffrey, a former "Spooks") child with her regardless of her needs. The last two members of the cast are Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with everyone and everyone, sex is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) is a somber doctor who has an affair with a his son, his son, sent his career and loved life spiraling. That being said, I am now inclined and I hope the BBC will continue to play this series because it is good, it is different and has an excellent distribution.
