First of all things first, this movie is very beautiful. A person working on 3D CG movies as a lighter / composer, visual gave me out. Every second I was amazed by what was on the screen. As for the story, well, it's okay. It will not put the world on fire, but if you like the futuristic Blade Runner-esquire stories (and who will not?) Then you will be fine. I have to say that I felt that the acting voice was particularly gentle and dropped out of the film as a whole. I saw her at the cinema in English, but I hope there is a floating French version somewhere. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing.
