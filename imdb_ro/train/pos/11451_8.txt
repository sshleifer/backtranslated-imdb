A very interesting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists largely of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which gets blown when the tide reaches the beach or the wind blows to the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really last except for photographs or movies about what they were. Now, it can be argued that Goldsworthy's work is a reflection of mortality or words in that sense, but it is not easier to say that what he is doing is just a beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are generally bitter, demanding, often mentally unstable, living in fallen urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious person, a family that loves nature and lives in a small Scottish village (of course, I'm sure the same reasons are why he was avoided by some people in the art world who found their fluffy or superficial works).
