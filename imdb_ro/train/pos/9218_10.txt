First, let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year, because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion about the movie. Anyway, no video store has taken it but low and saw the local library. I looked and loved him absolutely. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was made good and funny. It was not degrading in any way. Every actor and actress did a great job. I laughed very much about sexual humor. Generally, I think this movie deserves to be seen if you can find it. It is adorable and simply fun to look at. I rarely rank movies like a 10, but I give this a 10! <br /> <br /> Go find and watch it!
