Absolutely hilarious. John Waters's loved one for those he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted ditty, with lots of looks and laughs. It's like being turned into a museum of kitsch! I did not laugh so much in a theater from the serial moms. I liked to see old friends from Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe back in front of the Waters Room. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best elements of past atrocities (especially underestimated polyester) and many new surprises. He hurt me in a wonderful way. Thank you, John!
