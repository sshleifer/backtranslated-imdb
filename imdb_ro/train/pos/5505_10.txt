This is something new. There is a coup and a few Irish documentaries are right inside. A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring his people literate and encourages them to read the constitution is openly seen by the private media openly as a dictator, mentally unstable, the new hitler, etc. without repercussions from governments (such as their silence through bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, they still say they are suppressed, of course. See how the media enjoys their own role in the coup on the TV after breaking the government with the help of generals rouge (how much more stupid can you get?). And see how the people of Venezuela head to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands and reinstalling the elected government. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a Hollywood story, but it really happened against the US's explicit wishes. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of action, acute and totally embarrassing for the main supporters of the coup: US, good, democratic, loving and free, who still feeds large sums of money for Chavez's political opponents) /> <br /> Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
