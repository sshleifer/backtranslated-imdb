To the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz buff. There is an exhibition which will run until the end of June the new Mus√©e du QUAI Branly called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, not to be missed, with a special entertainment NINE extracted from movies jazz, including the famous success of the drum from PHANTOM LADY . I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their film appearances and can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. It was a breakthrough because in most of his appearances he was killed (mainly in Howard Hawks "THE BIG SLEEP"). 2. Krupa probably named Cook in PL. I could recognize the style, because he already graduated tom-tome used (and abused) in his career - ie sequences SING, SING, SING Hollywood Hotel in 1937 - and won in the end everything possibly from what I call French in "caisse claire". 3. The PL sequence, at least as it is presented in the Museum, is not censored. Charry carasso, Paris, France
