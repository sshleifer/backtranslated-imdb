This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm going to a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and become disgusted, happy and in love! All this in less than two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are brilliant! I have to mention the main actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way! He remembered Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. We recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy!
