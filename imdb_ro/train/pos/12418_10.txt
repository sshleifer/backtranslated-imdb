The film and the sequel to Barry McKenzie are the two great comedies that will ever be produced. A great story, a young blond Aussie travels to England to claim her inheritance and meets with her colleagues who are just as in love and innocent as he. It's a big block, saying, where else would you find someone who needs a drink so bad that it's just as dry as a dingo mortar? superb, top-quality characters, and has good and more consuming saddles Fosters, then three more films put together. Top notch. And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and are full of extraordinary celebrities. Definitely the two favorite films of all time, they follow them at least once every two weeks.
