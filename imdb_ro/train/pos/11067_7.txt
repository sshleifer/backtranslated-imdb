At the end of the movie I still do not know whether I liked it or not. This is the case with most commentators. But, however, still feel that the film is worth 7 for the efforts made. For a long time I read a quote: There are 2 types of writers, 1. Those who think and SCRIE. AND 2. Those who write and make readers think. while here I feel like GUY Ritchie did this too literally and left all the thought to the audience. I felt the film was a mixed bag filled with some of the lawyers DEVILS and FIGHT CLUB. .. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a classic: something that nobody understands but appreciates .... what I do not understand: why Stathom (Jake Green) had blackout (that's how it started everything), all riddles and mysteries in the film were taken into account, except for this. If you read this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about: I will post very midnight hitting me and if you still decide to watch this movie or not: then answer first .... when you saw a a puzzle called "no one has ever solved" you want to try? <br /> <br /> I would love to
