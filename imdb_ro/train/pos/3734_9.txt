The dehumanizing effect of the war is a topic that has long been studied in films; as well as the dehumanizing but potentially life-saving effect of military training. "Tigerland" by Joel Schumacher follows the standard model, we see the men treated as dirty but appear as soldiers with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and it is judged whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is the judgment of the merits of the war for which they are trained (usually here as Vietnam). But "Tigerland" has a special interest, concentrating on a dissident called Bozz (who played very well with Colin Farrell) who understands that all power ultimately governs by consent and lack of awareness among those lacking their own complicity. A learned plot has been built around this character, which has attracted attention and is also a plus that action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket," to name just another movie the same guy, moved to Asia). Although it's not an amazingly original film, it's an extremely good and exciting world-wide view: the best film from this director I've seen and among the best of its kind.
