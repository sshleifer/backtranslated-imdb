This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just a big one! It is not an idealist film, I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. Characters are very nice, but they also have some "dark" parts, which makes you think they are real people. A great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but you can find happiness with "fire and passion", as Gigi would say the main character.
