"The Couple Odd" is one of those movies that exceed her reputation. People everybody know her, they get the thematic song, they complain about living a bad Oscar or a "fastidious" Felix ... but they sub-sell the movie without knowing it. It's not about a guy who lives with a rude guy; is a portrait of the two friends who help each other through agony of divorce. It's also funny from start to finish, but it's kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful, and simply terrible situations. So, some viewers found the movie a little awkward, but I believe its veracity is his strength. Besides, the face of Matthau's bulldog only breaks me! My favorite comedy, a mile from country.
