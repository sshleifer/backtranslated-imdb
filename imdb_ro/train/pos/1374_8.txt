A French film Ester Williams would like it. But the synchronized swimming was just a hook for the story of three faces in a Paris neighborhood that they found. There is no doubt that Sciamma's sympathies are based on the fact that all boys are described as "animaux," but in fact only the 3 girls are at the center of attention for the whole period, with a few adults and other teenagers being largely in the background. Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forcing Floriane (a high quality Renascence beauty for each reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience with Anna: not appealing, but for her, the time of her body perfection was short and now she is a teenager in a body of women. What follows is a journey towards self-realization without a roadmap, but there is a noise on the three non-natural ones: where is the joy and lack of wisdom of the youth? While d√©nouement was breathing, with Florian's self-absorption portrayed nicely, as well as an equally beautiful union between Marie and Anne, everything seemed abstract, Sciamma's puppets.
