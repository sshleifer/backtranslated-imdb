"Man on the Moon" is a pretty good movie. It is very emotional sometimes and is very well made from all points of view. I would not say the movie was terribly original, but what is it about these days? Casting members have done a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at an early age and he's got a good job. Jason London also does a good job. The only person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes it seems to be the kind of father you're afraid of, but in the end you like his character. The rest of the distribution was very good as well. If you are in touching about growing movies and doing what life throws at you, then you should look at this movie. I would suggest you read the synopsis of the plan, and if it sounds like something that interests you then go for it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, Chris
