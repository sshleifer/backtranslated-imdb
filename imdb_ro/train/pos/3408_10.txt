I give this film an A + movie for her full camp! Dietrich's daughter, Maria Riva, wrote in her book about her mother: "If you see Allah's Garden in the context of the high camp, it can be very funny." And how! I laughed at the joy of the overwhelmed score and the amazing, ridiculous, fantastic melodramatic dialogue. Visitors who have read Boyer's toupee's accounts (continued to appear unlit in heat) will stutter each time they appear. Dietrich and Boyer do not look too seldom when they give their lines - instead they look at a distance, probably their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you play in a turkish could looks good!). Dietrich's costumes are from this world. As Riva mentions in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton from Paramount and make him design some of the most divine gowns, such as beige dress and beige dress. rave about Technicolor. It is very hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. In short, if you look at Allah's Garden with an indulgent attitude and embrace your dissatisfaction, you can not help, but enjoy it.
