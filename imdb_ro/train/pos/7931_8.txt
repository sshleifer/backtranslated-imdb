If someone was expecting a big zombie movie after reading that title, then you are a retarder and deserve to be disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, I expected a low-budget zombie - and that's exactly what I received. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a small movie. The zombies were exactly as it should have been, because all the zombies have turned ON, so they are freshly injured zombies. Obviously they did it because it would have been quite expensive if they had done everything on the rounded zombie FX. I got it all, I have no idea how someone could seriously bloody this movie. It's called "HOOD OF THE DEAD" for the love of God! Are you looking at "Redneck Zombies" and some Uwe Boll movies and are you really looking forward to be great? Of course not! So why are some stutters on IMDb crying like school girls about this movie, I will never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies out there, so do not say it's the worst you've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! Have you ever seen "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "The House of the Dead" ???? These are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you can not see that it's just a low-budget zombie movie, obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I would also like to see a sequel.
