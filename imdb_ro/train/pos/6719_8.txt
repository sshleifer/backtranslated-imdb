I like this movie because it's a good cinematic work done by people who care to do their art and not just their home movies. It's packed with Superregister's home movies by Greg Noll and an amateur video load from others who have been aligned with his 50-year-old passion. However, it has been extended to the extent that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, no matter how trivial you may think navigation is athletic. Surfers are not astronauts, nor test pilots. They are not surgeons (maybe) or doctors (again, maybe). She believes in the surfer's search. She believes in the beauty of the human goane. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from the end of the war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the northern beach of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. She celebrates the gap between a country that fought a cold war - instead of a warm war - with the Russian socialists. Surf is the last narcissism. It's dangerous, but only a little historic. I suspect that Alexander the Great would not have been celebrated for his navigation technique. He had to come out and conquer dozens of countries to get the favorable press he received. This movie has no military heroes. He has no weapons. The only conquering beach surfers have a beer stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.
