A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a living image of a deeply divided country (for further proof, see some of the comments on IMDb ...!). It compares favorably with Oliver Stone's "Commander" (which is mainly a thorough examination of Fidel Castro's nostrils). I do not know if Chavez is what he is, or another on the long line of Latin American "caudillos" populism. I do not even know if he will be able to cope with the huge expectations he has clearly built among the weakest of Venezuela's majority. It is unreasonable to expect a movie like this to be able to answer such questions - but I certainly have a pretty good idea of ​​what is at stake and what seems to be caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the movie "we're making history," and that's exactly what the movie feels as if it's capturing it. Remarkable stuff.
