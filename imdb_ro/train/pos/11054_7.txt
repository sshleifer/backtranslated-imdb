My brothers and I came across the Champions, when our local station broadcast a new summer in the '70s. I totally adored it. It was something so exotic and mysterious about this, especially when compared to the usual American revolutions (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you have an idea). It had a similarity with The Avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also English in spy / adventure). I would love to see it again now - I hope I'll keep it. I mentioned this show to others and nobody ever heard of it, so I started to wonder if I imagined my entire existence. But the wonder of the web allowed me to find information about it. Hopefully he'll find a new generation of fans.
