This early Anime movie was a pretty good film I once caught on Science Fiction when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the rating disaster that adult swimming claims to be in the cartoon network. I honestly believe that it has less to do with being less popular and more with the fact that people would now prefer to buy DVDs are watch episodes unleashed on the internet. This movie probably did not have all that much cuts and the voice work was fine for a double film, although I'd rather see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some pretty annoying voices for children in something called. This movie has a boy embarking on a train called Galaxy Express, hoping he can get to a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to revenge his mother, who was brutally killed by a robot who hunts people for fun. During his adventures, he becomes friends with the various workers on board the train, as well as a woman who resembles his deceased mother, a beautiful woman called Matel, who, like the biggest woman in Anime movies, has a secret that would it could be very good for our young hero, or very bad. He goes from the planet to the planet as well, when the train makes different stops and turns into a space pirate called Captain Harlock, who apparently played in his own cartoon series, so basically Galaxy Express takes place in that universe . All in all a very good walk, with a pretty strange and unexpected ending. It would be a sequel to this, but it was not as good as it was, but the end was a bit finer than it was here.
