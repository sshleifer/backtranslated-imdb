This film is one of the many "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, full of cheap sound effects, dialogues and fast martial arts action. But, unlike most of these films, it also has a decent plot and an extraordinary comedy. When the workers of a painting factory are forced out of service by Manchu's aggressors, they hire a con artist (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt fails, he heads to a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for the truth. But instead of making him a Kung Fu student, the Master orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 rooms. Well, it seems that while doing these minor tasks (stacking and binding the bamboo shelves), he learns the skills of being a Kung-fu expert! It's something like Karate Kid, when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel about the basics of karate, making him do usual household chores - "Wax, wax," and so on. There are a lot of extraordinary comedies from the beginning to the end, and a lot of action at the end of when Gordon Liu faces again with Manchu's torture. "This time it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu says proudly in his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss this movie!
