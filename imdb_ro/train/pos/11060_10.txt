This movie is great. Writing, directing, acting all are fantastic. Very clever and intelligent scenario. The performance performances of actors, Ally Sheedy, are powerful, dynamic and delightful. Very original and unimaginably unpredictable. The scenes are alive with fresh energy and a very talented production.
