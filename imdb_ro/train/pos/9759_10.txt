I think I got this movie when I was a young dollar. I remembered seeing her as a child, but I could not find the movie. I remembered well with Ragedy Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedy, King Koo Koo. I've been looking tall and low for this movie and I'm still not lucky. But one day when I moved from childhood I found it. We were reunited. I'm 17 years old now. I'm still looking. All the time, actually. It's one of the funniest and funniest movies I've seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think he should do a sequel. Mmm, really do a sequel. Now I'm even thinking about taking the tattoos of the captains somewhere on my body!
