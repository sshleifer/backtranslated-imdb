When I heard about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of many of his films that I thought I'd see again. What a wonderful comment in the movie even after these years. And Guinness helps weave the charm in every frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film must be considered lifetime favorites.
