Okay, this little movie is especially interesting for an artist, a movie or a music creator or a visual artist to: <br /> <br /> You can feel and examine David's touch / style from a short piece relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of frames, vessels, and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even a simple film, this creation is multi-layer. For example, there are some sounds that end up over time, while others appear (though subtle) at certain points to support certain photos. You can also see some types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle way back. There is a diagonal pan. Also, the zoomes sometimes go back. <br /> <br /> Lightning and the composition / arrangement of the elements in space is, as usual and obviously, the work of an artist / artist. This can be felt even in this crazy room. This means: it is possible to make a special art already through the simple art of putting the layout and composing the scene. Then comes the forcelines of the images: like digonales, parallel, etc. The degradations and colors of light, though not much research for textures as well as large productions, are also beautiful. This is a sketch of an artist ... Everything is not computed, but done with an inner feeling and this sensation gives touch / sentiment to David, as with any true artist.
