One of my favorite movies. He has everything - the rock soundtrack, thanks to Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, a lot of action, lots of laughter, a total ridiculous plot, and the most wonderful stereotypes of the 1980s as characters. Eddie, the guy who wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (as wet as I am), Nuke (burnstone), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (the geek), and Ozzy as a preacher (sure is it in America?). Then there are boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and girls (vacant, vain and stupid). What can you ask for? First of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, a rockasser amalgam of the '80s that you can think of. How about the rocket that burns the guitar? Then there is the scene where Sammy pulls the old man on the TV screen and shakes it. So what's Roger doing? Why, pick it up, as if it were a good geek. My favorite scene is the place where Tim Hainey receives the prolonged reward from Sammi through his wet finger in the magic plug! If you were in rock in the '80s or you just love ridiculous movies like me, then check out this one. It is available on DVD and very cheap (trick or) treat you.
