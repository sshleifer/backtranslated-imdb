One of the last classics of the new French wave. For direction, cinematographer Jean Eustache drew on the simplicity of the XIV century cinema; for the story, Eustache attracted the tortures of his own complicated love life. Such things can be said about this brilliant observer; it's too indulgent; occasionally hilarious; emotional evacuation ... etc. In my mind, any complaints that can be directed against this film are slightly shaded by its many strengths. Every film student, writer, or simply anyone who wants to handle a 3-hour film without steep cuts without music overstyling, no soap-like plotting, and no banal dialogue should not be a point to see this movie. Everything must be admired: the writing (concise, intelligent, surprisingly funny) that acts (it just is perfect in their roles) and the simple direction (the spectator feels like an occasional observer in the film) makes it an unforgettable film . This is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
