I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm biased. When the show was over, I felt that too many questions were left unanswered. This movie I enjoyed closing. To see all the people we have followed in recent years together, in the end, was the most rewarding. I hear this is probably the only homicide movie we can expect. If this is possible, this is the right way to get out. This movie is sometimes disturbing, sometimes upsetting, but always satisfying. If you are or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
