After seeing this intense martial arts film for the first time for almost 18 years, I have to say that it has not lost even its mystical and martial artistic action, as I have remembered since my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor who sends his "unfinished" student out to find the five members of his poison clan so that he does not seek a fortune that the master's friend conceals. Because his last student did not have enough training, he instructed him to be friends with one of the five "venom" to defeat the other four. I can not say enough about choreography or camera work. A wonderful movie and quite possibly one of the best martial arts films ever made. UN CLASIC !!
