It would have been a classical classic fire if he'd chose ALBERT ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Either comedy, drama, tears, etc. It seemed that Priyadarshan realized at one point, and almost made her jump like a monkey to make her adventures in solo a little funny. It's the only remarkable drawback of a few more annoying tiddles) or otherwise an absolutely hilarious movie. The best comedy to come to Bollywood from Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a comedy on the shoulders of a brilliant scenario and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably the best performance so far. Better be a shoe for the best comedian at each assignment function. AK was always good at comedy, but he leads her to another level here. Body language, facial expressions and just the way he provides each line. It's a genius performance. The packed theater has been crazy for almost the entire length of the movie and I do not think I've ever seen such a movie atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the US. Garam Masala have no "lead" heroine. She plays 3 incredibly beautiful beautiful girls who think I did a pretty good job. Pretty sure everyone makes their debut. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine is wicked after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typically annoying self (sick of his act everywhere in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. Generally, it certainly deserves a decho. I would say it is FUNNIER than no entry, and that says a lot. It could have been better if he had chosen someone more competent than John Abraham. 8/10
