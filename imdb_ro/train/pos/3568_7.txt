This movie moves the Cinderella story back in the early 1950s and makes good use, if it is eccentric, of the Isle of Man as a background. Ugly sisters have become brilliant English-speaking girls, and together with Kathleen Turner, as a stepmother, they are scattered in various wonderful costumes. The story changes a little from the traditional version: the beginning is strangely combined with the "King Lear" plot, and in later stages Cinderella is harsher than usual. It looks splendid and works all the way pretty well, but it goes over the top sometimes.
