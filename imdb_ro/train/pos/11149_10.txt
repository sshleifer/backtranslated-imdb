Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides he will leave his little life in Texas and make the big city big. Women are there to ask and men are mainly "tutti-fruttis". With big eyes, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the humiliating misadventures he is living, one worse than the other. In the midst of that chaos, he meets and marries Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless man living in a seemingly condemned building. There is not much story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes designed to bring not only impressions of Joe Buck in the city, but the intersection of past and show us in cuts to shock and fragments sequences dream semi-psychedelic past or: his relationship with his girlfriend, Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was gang raped, abandoned by his mother and his grandmother apparent abuse, which was also wont to burden people with money. An air of pessimism dominates the film from the beginning, because Nilsson plays through the opening credits his flourishing blossoming "Everyone Speaks"; We feel that even while you want Joe to do the latter mark in the city, chances are high that it will not and will get to work for money in a job dead - shown in a view later in the film , while he wants a man to work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know from the sight in his eyes that he does not want to end this way. A dark story of broken hope, John Schlesinger creates images of lost souls in the late 60s and the center, dominant friendship between two men, while struggling to make some kind of sense of their lives in the midst of a life of comfort elusive worthy. There idea default that might have been lovers - Ratso get to hug Joe onstage party and embrace final end certainly indicate that - but it is essentially a movie buddy who succeeds survive, literally, to death and bring some form of hope to Joe, who at the end of Florida seems much changed, older and wiser.
