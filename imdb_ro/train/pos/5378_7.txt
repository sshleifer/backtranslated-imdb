This is an interesting little film made in 1967 with a twangy jazz music and a plot that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun. I have seen many similarities between this and "AKA The Dead Blood" and have the same director! Scotland Yard is the best investigating the killing of young ladies at a college. It seems that offenders are left out of a local prison to offend a bad person and then return when their work is done. There is a wonderful hidden device inside a Bible that breaks down Prussian acid and there is another device that is neither chirlish nor clandestine, it seems to be a large gun and the victim must be almost soaked before their expiration. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and most chews the rubber and looks in the distance. There is a "monk" and as someone identifies this as a "monk" is beyond me, wearing a whip and dressing in a red suit with a red hood, more than a Klan member of a color other than a monk . There are all kinds of devices such as a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to recognize the monk, and even traversing the fire without putting his coat, a wonderful trick right there. This is a strange combo of crime drama with goofy accents, and while it's pretty stupid at times, it's fun to look. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
