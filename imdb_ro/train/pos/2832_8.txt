I saw this film in 1969, when it was first released at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now the famous Crowbar nightclub. It was the last year of the 1960s and this movie really hit home. It has everything; generation gap, sexual revolution, search for success, and the conflict between pursuing "family traditions" and those seeking their own way through life. It was a fast, extremely pleasant film. Vegas was at the most hippie peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflict, romance and even a happy ending. A very pleasant moment for everyone. <br /> <br /> The poster on this movie is based on the wall of my bedroom. I look at her and come back in time; a time of my youth and of my time with my father, a wonderful moment in my life.
