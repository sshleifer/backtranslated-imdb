The first time I saw that I got half of it, but I looked and knew later that it was about a witch sales attempt. They focused on Sara Good's family. She is famous because she cursed a priest who was fulfilled. In the film describing her daughter Dorcas and her husband, the spirit of husband Ann Putnam Sara comes to future hunters to redeem her soul. which happens at the end of the movie. Dorcas is described as a witch at the age of five who is burnt on the stake. What's Never Happening Ann putnam saves her from the flames. the girl is safe, she goes to Ann Putnam's tomb to see it is not empty, but it's at first because she accuses her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death. Now that Ann putnam saves her, her spirit is redeemed and she is not a degradation of society for her witch trials.
