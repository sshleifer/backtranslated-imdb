Alain Chabat is a good actor, writer and director, but maybe he was unlucky enough to give a credit idea for a story that probably made them roll in the corridor when Aristofan was still taught he was " "before" e "c". But, as I said, Chabat is a good actor and can make charm when he needs it. They also gradually overcome an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg, which also turns into performance. If he insists absolutely on knowledge, the "plot" is about the 40-year-old guy and more than the content of being alone. This does not fit well with his mother and the five sisters, and to get them out of the back, he makes an "arrangement" with a colleague's sister who poses - for a fifteen thousand euros - the new girlfriend, to leave romance to come to a marriage and then to catch it, leaving it like a hook. Naturally, they end up together, but there are a number of sub Benedek and Beatrice on the way, all things considering it as a minute without pain for 90 minutes and acting so well at the French box office that the continuation can not be overcome.
