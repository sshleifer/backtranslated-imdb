(contains lightweight spoilers) It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey in Frank Capra's "It's a wonderful life," so it's easy to find the parallel between the two films. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey gets to see the world as if it had never been born. In "The Far Country," Jeff Webster of Stewart, by not getting involved in helping anyone else (except himself), comes to see essentially the same thing: A world in which he (for all practical aspects) it does not exists. /> <br /> By not getting involved (and trying not to care for anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can help but be cared for wounded, pushed around and even killed in while sitting and doing nothing. This reminds viewer George Bailey of seeing a world overturned, because he also decided not to be involved in the fact that he was never born. <br /> <br /> Both films end up with the same picture - a bell bell. Stewart, transforming his philosophy of non-involvement, seems to win his "wings."
