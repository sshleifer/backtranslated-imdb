"My Left Foot" is a pretty impressive film telling the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was paralyzed with cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only body member he had under his control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as the best actor for this film, which I'm not sure it deserved but still worth mentioning. Day-Lewis gives Brown a touch of realism and, from time to time, almost humorous. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and emotional role. My problem with this movie is that it's sometimes too real. When Brown is desperate and needs to help someone and do everything with his left foot, the movie can be difficult to watch. This gives her a very depressing feeling that can stop some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have handicaps and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not cramped and still think we have problems are inspired by this film, because if we can, to some extent, with a much worse condition than we can overcome our difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Good, occasionally pleasant, but difficult to follow. It can not be for everyone but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
