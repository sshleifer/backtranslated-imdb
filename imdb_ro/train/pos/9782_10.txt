Peaches is really a great movie. I wrote this to reject a review from someone called "Auscrit" who appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that either the first Monahans movie "Interview" is somewhat TV is an extraordinary statement. Here's a movie that has been praised significantly across the world because it's simply one of the best Australian movies ever made. He was fully deserved to win the best picture. Peaches is a courageous, daring and courageous departure. For me it works on every level and I've seen it twice. Monahan is a director who demonstrates great skill and incredible sensitivity. For "Auscrit" to comment that it is another TV movie and that Hugo Weaving is not good, he just does not "get" the movie. Or, especially, he does not want to get it. Honestly is a kind of comment you expect from another director who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone inside the industry, either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average point, I found it does not write comments like this. I noticed other comments on the site and a reference to the Sommersault movie. We need to ask what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately, in Australia, when the SS was released, the push was, if you did not like then it was something wrong with you not the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite common down. Reality is the only resemblance between the two films being the fact that they are movie pass rights. Unfortunately for me the SS is a movie about nothing that could have been said in 15 minutes. I see him as a dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can not wait for what the Monahan still does, being clearly ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. To conclude, if the movie does not win all this year's AFI and IF awards, then it's a rigid game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive with time
