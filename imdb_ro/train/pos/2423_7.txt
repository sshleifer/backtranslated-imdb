Once in Life means once a stick, always a cane, and no one enters or comes out of "The Life" for free. Winners in New York sell drugs and scam because they can not do it in the legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record or drug habit, or because they are just lazy. This simple story, with a few twists on the most spirited characters, manages to uncover the public's compassion for its main players because of loyalty and compassion for each of them. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays 20/20 Mike (all pups have nicknames), and is based on his play, "Riff Raff". It feels like a play from the beginning to the end, especially in the longest scene where the three main players have split up to decide who can be trusted. Often, the dialogue comes very quickly, much faster than on stage, and I think it's the biggest flaw in the movie. Mixed retrospectively in the film are street poems, a kind of rap pentamer, which is violent and evocative of the world this film reveals. Poetry makes it harder for these men to be fired, those cursed men who kill, mislead and betray each other as indiscriminate for our attention or under our contempt. The disturbing issue about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer the same reasons as all of us. One is too bad, another a drug addict, and the latter suffers from consciousness while the audience wonders or even laughs at the irony of the executioners, asking them to hang, to tell his jokes in the middle of his death.
