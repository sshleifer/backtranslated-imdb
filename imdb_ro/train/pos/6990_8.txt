Bela Lugosi appeared in some of these low-budget cooling for Monogram studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. Bela plays a crazy scientist who kidnaps the young bridegroom and kills them and then extracts liquid from their bodies so that he can keep his elderly father looking young. After a reporter and a doctor spend their night at home and discover that she is responsible for the deaths of the brides, the next morning they say these crimes are done by the police, and the crazy scientist is shot and dead dead after a while. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You have almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old vagabond, an angry and a dwarf (her sons), a storm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find that they sleep better in the coffin than in the movie beds. Corps Vanishes is worth watching, especially for Bela Lugosi's fans. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
