I loved this movie absolutely! I was hesitant to see at first, because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching "Two of us" took me back to a happier moment when he was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think the writer did a stunning job describing what "could have been." Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the head of the challenge. I was impressed by my accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite credible like John. My favorite parts were the scene from the park and the scene on the roof - which was so painful. The film left me both sad and satisfying, both of which I find fit, given the circumstances.
