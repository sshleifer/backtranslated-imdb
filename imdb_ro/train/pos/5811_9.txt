Just a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if it was more of a plot for the film, but Moonwalker still remains a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment to this day. Beginning with mounting Jackson's long career clips, he reminds the viewer only why he is often considered the "King of the Pop". From the "I Want to Come Back" hit to "We Are the World," the winning multi-prize book for Africa's benefit. As a result, a short, though short film in an Oscar winning screenplay, still offers a fantastic and fun drama to the audience. Ending with a perfect (sexy!) Performance of The Come Coming Movie. Something the whole family can look and enjoy.
