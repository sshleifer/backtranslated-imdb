I have to say it was a fun movie. Despite the fact that the doubling was quite cheesy, and there were some odd moments when the movie seemed to become dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan clan has to follow the other five members and find out who is using their abilities for evil and who uses them forever. The victory was that during the training, the whole clan was masked and all came back from the society in disguise and changed their name. Fighting is a joy to watch, every member of the Poison Clan has a different fighting style: frog (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The battle scenes have actors jumping everywhere, and fortunately, the camera remains planted and uses enough breath to see clearly the action. One drawback of the movie is that the story tends to shoot a bit in the first half of the game until the first battle sequence. But stay with him, and you will not be disappointed!
