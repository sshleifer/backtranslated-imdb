It was not a day in 2002 if I was not followed by a scarecrow I felt that this movie treated a serious problem Well brought back a lot of memories because it was so realistic < > Even today I have baskets of corn on the hull and I can not even approach the preserved things in the fear of my life <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at some point in the movie you had to stop it because it hit too close to the house <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie, you could be educated about how victims felt for us /> This movie teaches us not to take life as celebrated or to put on corn, believe me, I was there and have scars Watch the film, amazing and educative
