This movie is horrible - in a way "so bad is good". The story is rehashed from so many other films of this kind that I do not even bother to describe it. It's a picture of sword / witchcraft, has a child who hopes to realize how important it is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide / wizard, a princess, a hairy creature .... get the point. br /> <br /> The first time I caught this movie was during a very tough winter. I do not know why I decided to keep on watching him for another five minutes before returning the channel, but when I got the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it until the end of it. Gulfax is a white, blond-like creature like Chewbacca, but it's not as useful or fun to watch. It seems someone stuck a bunch of white carpet and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes in which it seems that the actor can not move inside or almost fall. Although he is not in the movie so much, some scenes deserve! Watch how she tries to talk to Bo Svenson, taking the Solo-Chewbacca comparison to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie just because of that character, and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax can look like Sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I've never seen or even sought him was because of his absence! Perhaps there should be a final movie, ending the trilogy, Gulfax will make a long awaited return!
