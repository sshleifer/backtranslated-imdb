I was hit by this movie when we were eBay'ing Caesars Palace, as I admire the rich history of Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts in good condition (if you do not count on Bally's, the original MGM Grand). In this sense, this film offers full force. You are offered a tour of Caesars property, which, despite all the renovations and additions it has made over the last 40 years it has been opened, seems alarmingly similar. As a global movie, the plot is somewhat difficult to track, largely due to horrific editing. And when I say terribly, I do not use that word easily. There are a lot of vegas traffic fragments, casinos, and even a scene where the character Robert Drivas has a conversation with his father about how much he grew up and without any explanation he (Drivas) goes (in those infamous fragments ) from being himself, to a child, to a little boy and then back to him as he speaks back and forth with his father. (That does not give any details about the plot, if you can, someone can be prepared for it and maybe they will not be as dizzy as editing.) The film ages well and has a good message about the differences inherent between a father and his son whom most guys might have in a form or fashion.
