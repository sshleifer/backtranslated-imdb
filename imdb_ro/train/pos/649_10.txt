We do not have to miss this movie, this is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the new vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we only have these black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most underestimated French directors. You have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget her. <br /> <br /> P.S: I'm sorry for English ...
