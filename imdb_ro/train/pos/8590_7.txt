Seeing Keifer Sutherland playing my favorite character in the history of television, it was a foregone conclusion that I will go to the movies and spend $ 15 on the subject. I also think this is true for Eva Longoria fans. The film revolves around a leak that an agent of the Secret Service intends to assassinate the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems that the only candidate is Pete (Mihail Douglas) very decorated. Going innocently, Pete goes on the fun, fugitive style to find the truth. It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent distribution, a decent story, but it made me feel a little empty, but you could certainly do a lot worse.
