Adolf Hitler's manicidal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a series of seven films produced by the US Department of War. as an instructive tool for the new soldiers to enter the armed forces during the Second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-conceived, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, the expansion to the European center, and then the transition to the "World Island" of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final move would be to get over the oceans for the final conquest of America and the world. In 1935, Hitler ordered national recruitment, while the rest of the country fell under his spell. Grade school children sang praise and young German boys were trained and indoctrinated in military camps. Unlearned in Austria in 1938, Hitler followed the annexation of a strip of land adjacent to Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was amazed to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with its mortal enemy in Russia, a tool to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately thereafter, Germany invaded Poland, bringing Hitler's victory to the brink of Russia. He would treat her later. During this time, the United Kingdom still refused to oppose Hitler's attack across Europe. The Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, felt he had won a great victory for his country, accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous statement that said "Peace in Our Time". It did not turn out like this. The most fascinating information I have learned in this installment, at least for me, was provided by a small piece of material from a German Hitler rally in the mid-thirties. It was led by a German American who took the courage from the homeland. Venue - Madison Square Garden!
