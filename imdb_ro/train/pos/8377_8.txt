My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I'm trying to look for movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Some big ones. They beat the bell and hit one another, with the fate of the nations hung in the balance. It's very cool. You have to forgive this film for its many shortcomings and try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians managed to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It's really hard not to like this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought as professional fighters! He made my friend smile. And that's good enough for me. And it is worth mentioning veteran actor Paul Koslo: the shameful Russian man, whether he ruthlessly wanders over his helpless opponents after he has already surrendered or complained that his approach to him in a bar caused his vodka to taste " such as the blood "(a line he delivers with a delicious sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he clearly has a ball and the movie benefits enormously whenever it's on the screen. This is a great little game that deserves the reputation of the cult.
