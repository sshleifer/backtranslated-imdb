What happens when the media joe finds it has supernatural powers? The premise may sound familiar. What do you know? Unbreakable? However, the SF action movie, The Sword Bearer, is far from the standard stock. The story revolves around a man called Sasha, who, as a boy, was avoided by society, his colleagues and his family because of a supernatural power he possesses. When he wishes or his wrath allows, a sword extends from his arm that loses its own skin. Very dirty? Maybe ... but that's not the interesting part of this movie. He lost all his life and was driven by anger (and a temperament he has), our "hero" returns to his hometown to return his life or to find a reason. The only thing he encounters here is the difficulty when a meeting with the new boyfriend of an old flames leaves him bled on the ground. Here comes the game of revenge and anger. This is a man you do not want to cross, and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. He meets a girl and falls in love instantly like she is and that's really the movie. The film is very impressive, with bold colors and noir tones combined with short, but extreme action sequences. This is an art house at its core, beautifully shot with such attention to detail in every scene in front of an awful sci-fi action. It's that weird mash that interests me so much in this movie. The director's approach to this genre is refreshing focusing on Sasha's emotional journey and not a direct action movie. Do not worry, the action is there and a lot of it. However, much of these sequences show only implicit violence with images of the next horrible. This does not mean that the action is not displayed. These scenes are here and they are fantastic (especially the end of seeing Sasha's full powers unleashed in despair). The director chooses to mean the violence of many scenes to keep focus on the character's emotional struggle. This is a story of tragic love and a refreshing entrance to the genre.
