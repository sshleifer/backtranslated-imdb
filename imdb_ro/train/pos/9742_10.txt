This independent independent film in Argentina is one of the best in 2000 from all over South America, including Argentina, which has produced a staggering number of quality films since 1999. Only in 2000 Argentina has released many quality films that have broken Argentinean BO records. Half a dozen was rated internationally, like this, at major world film festivals. After watching this film, one can see how Argentina's original films have managed to recover 20% of the national film market last year. Directed by one of Argentina's finest directors, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of global globalization, but it emphasizes its impact on Argentina and especially on the Jewish community in Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the beautiful Jewish boy, trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors in Hispanic cinema around the world, is perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, as well as other distributors, including Spanish and Italian stars. Western urban societies are being explored, I do not have enough space to get into the details. Daniel Burman intelligently blends them into plot, with different characters that personify various dilemmas. If this movie plays at a festival next to you or on a movie, do not miss it!
