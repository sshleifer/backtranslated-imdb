Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I have to admit to those who did not see him. You will really love or even really hate it. It's been a year since Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so great that many were simply disappointed because the intrigue is so simple. But it's based on a comic ... what would you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! Sets, make-up, music, costumes and impressive acting make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and does not have a bad language - that's rare in these days. He directed, produced and played the role of Warren Beatty as a crime ace who heads against Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thieves. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. It has the best lines I've heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the most wonderful things about the movie is that they used only seven colors to make it look like a comic. This movie is really a piece of art that, unfortunately, is overlooked by the public. To summarize things, this movie takes the baby out of us all. It's a movie that will let you smile at the end.
