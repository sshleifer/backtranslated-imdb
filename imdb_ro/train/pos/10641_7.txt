this dolphin lundgren vehicle is a fun dying hard action action comeback, it is not going to win any prizes and not very original, but it offers the goods you want to see from a lundgren dolphin movie. our dolph man is an ex-soldier who is now a professor at a high school high school and when he is picked up by terrorists until he rescues the day. sure that the script will not win any Oscar for fun and has the fair action of his actions. Dolph lundgren gives good performance, but comes more in action scenes, and others are not the best actors, but I keep it well. all in all detention is a pleasant action, but you have seen it a million times before.
