This group of English professionals is a pleasure to watch. Support towers could form a series of their own. It is seen before the tiangle love between the head of surgery, his wife and a new lieutenant of cute surgery. Only the superior acting qualities of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Sexy Robson Greene raise this from the garbage category into a very nice "romp". The only question is that it is hard to accept that Francesca Annis will fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who likes me, is not an international symbol or even a symbol of British sex. You can easily understand why Robson Green will light the fire with apologies for "Doors". The guy who almost steals the spectacle with great performance "back" is Owen's father, David Bradley. Watch it in The Way We Live Now, in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​its range. Daniela Nardini, the secretary of the kitchen, sometimes a sex toy, is hard to forget, because the overturned bitterness makes Kitchen happy that she has ever seen her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as friends of the Green surgeon, as I said, might have their own series. They are so good. The whole thing is very fun and I recommend it with great pleasure and thank you imdbman to let the paying customers have the word in this fascinating place.
