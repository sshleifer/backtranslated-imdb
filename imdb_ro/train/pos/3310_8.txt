In the film "Kongwon-do ui," he presents a relatively intimate look at meaning (and lack of meaning) in the lives of different Koreans; naked people looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escapism of nature. From the beginning to the end of the movie we notice the falsity of the different characters; we learn about their deficiencies and wishes, about the complex complexity captured in human life (and yet about the superior simplicity of mankind). Although the film moves slowly, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any idea, but allows ideas to come about themselves, allowing concepts to be revealed. The film ends as well as it begins, and really understands the meaning of loneliness, love is often an act of selfishness and many mistakes we make. It's a look in everyday life, very good and beautiful done. If you are looking for action or intense drama, this movie is not for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original and significant films that are not forced and glitz, this is a great movie to watch.
