THE KELLS SECRET may be the most exquisite movie I've ever seen from THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylishly different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and KUNG FU PANDA a 2D opening of the jaw, incredible artistic direction, production design, background / appearance and a wealth of color that is a feast for the senses of one. KELLS is so generous - almost gothic in its appearance (somewhat reminding Klimt), wonderfully flat in a general general outlook, ornamented in its Celtic design and enlightened, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing - and they all work together nicely. You fall in love with the characters when you meet them. You are so attracted to every detail of the story and every pencil and brush stroke. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at the Cartoon Saloon (and their extensive crews) have achieved with this small budget / very small film are amazing. The blow to supporting our animation community is phenomenal. This movie is staggering and the rumor among our colleagues recommending this movie is spreading like a fire. Congratulations to KELLS for her numerous awards, her nomination for Annie, and the current Oscar qualification rounds. They are all very well-deserved, indeed ...
