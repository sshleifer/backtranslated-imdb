I can not believe we do not have the seventh show. I have all 8 seasons of the 70th issue! I love absolutely! I sit in bed each night and watch more episodes before I go to bed. At the end of a long, agitated day, it's nice to give up and laugh well before going to bed. I was so sad that they took the show off the air ... at least we still re-run! I hope to pray and come back with at least one reunion ... As if Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married !!!! It would not be great! It would be even better if it went on for many years!
