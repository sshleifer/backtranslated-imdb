Since the beginning of the show, Carmen has been there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of it? The show is not the same as before. The worst. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace anyone from the beginning! That's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Chucky-free game! Is not correct! The niece who replaced her is just, uh! Awful. It does not fit into the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and her granddaughter can not replace her. She was a wonderful actress. Better than the niece. Take it back, or you'll lose a number of viewers.
