Sure he was well shot and done, very well shot and done! But the story was so feeble. And Lincoln's portrait was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but a cock. You want to tell me that Lincoln was a wise and perfect defender, without respect for law or court. That's who the hell ought to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, let me tell you "jackass" then ???? I understand Ford had a very funny hero, but I did not like this guy at all. She lives in sports, speaks like a really sweet, simple, and does not seem to be sitting in a courtroom. How should I take this seriously. The twist was even worse. Really, come back! It was stupid. The whole story seemed to have been thought of for about five years in her dreams. Saying I liked it enough, it was really fun and made me laugh many times, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that I have to say that it's good enough, nothing that has fun and laughs at me, can be bad, but this stupid and silly story was so ridiculous that I do not understand how one might think is awesome. > <br /> I have no idea how accurate this movie was from a historical point of view, but if it were true, I should have pulled my head off.
