Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a film about traditional Japanese folk music "yokai" or "monsters". It is also known as the Big Monster War or Ghosts on Parade. Yokai in the first installment includes a strange onion, kappa water imp, a brella life, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with an enormous wrist gourd and so far away. These types of capricious monsters derive not only from fairy tales, but from a kind of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa era, comparable to today's haunted houses of Halloween, or the "strange performances" of the past, but with the only fake oddities. Ghosts and gold monsters and lace-shaded laces have been tormented to create "chills" during the hot summer. The fatcheek woman was recreated through tricks or illusions, based on monsters described in medieval scrolls; and if their design for the film is a bit simple and hochy, it makes them even more representative of what has been recreated historically for summer chills. These monsters quite in love have to cope and destroy an old Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and disguised as a samurai. Despite the fact that some of the Japanese appearances are pretty naked, and too many of the costumes are more than the masks without even moving the lips while talking, everything is very comfortable and very charming. It has a beautiful cinema, as it would have been offered in a CGI movie of the same decade. Seen in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving and touching. Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not equal to Majin's, but Yokai is still very fun. The first movie Miike, which is the most child-oriented of family films, with GOZU & IZOO consecutively more serious, but not too severe for young spectators.
