I think this movie is the best film about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's performance with Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements to Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he uses light and shadow well. John Alton's camera is top-notch, as well as Franz Waxman's score. The cast includes many veteran players as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable show like Charlotte Manning. On the whole, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have been given more opportunities. I've always cherished this movie.
