I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (the director of the film and one of those who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something had their brain for a title " Rocket Boys "(I think) was devoid of anything. One day, they messed up with a computer program that makes words in other words (ie: type a word or a series of words and mix the letters and formulate other words) I think the technical term is an "anagram" However, they have written in "Rocket Boys" and pretty sure what is coming back is "October Sky". They were shocked to say at least. The title summed up everything in the film, because the film revolves around Sputnik. At first, Homer Jr did not like this idea, but he warmed up after he appeared and took off "the novel printed in the poster of the film."
