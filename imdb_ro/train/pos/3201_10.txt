This is an early film "Pilot" for the Canadian television hit Trailer Park Boys. It was played for directors in several networks before the Showcase decides to sign for a television series. A great action and a very funny cast make this one of the best comedy films of worship. The plot plot is that these two little time criminals go around the "extermination" of pets for money. If you have a dog next door barking all night, these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they find a job too big for them to manage and get a shot. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the television series. I recommended her! R rated for vows, violence and drug use. Not too offensive either (they do not even show the killing of animals)
