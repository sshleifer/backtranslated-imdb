And for me, this Christmas specialty is one that I very much remember. In 1989, I snatched the two CDs I found from recording on the soundtrack, giving them one sister and keeping the others for me. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now and I'd love to see the show again, rather than remembering how I listen. It was noticed elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show, and they did more than just one special together. The good relationship between Denver and his fuzzy companions is clear here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages.
