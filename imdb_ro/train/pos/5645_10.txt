I purchased the DVD set based on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail with that. I remember seeing the show when he was on TV, but he always wondered what happened to him. Ten years later, it's like looking at it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, even if they are somewhat rivals. Almost representing the good (Caleb) and the evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I did not really understand exactly what Lucas should have been, but let's just say that he has some special powers that I do not think he has given a saint. It can make phones ring, appear in writing, or even cause a person's emotions to change. However, there are some episodes in which he actually becomes the good guy, despite all of them. Generally, this is an excellent series that, like many others I can imagine, was canceled before their time (IE Point Pleasant, Prag, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) . Steven King's Dead Zone Zone (US Sunday Network) seems to be the only thing of its kind that seems to be doing. There's nothing right to watch TV. This is because any thing dealing with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must immediately be pulled from television. Meanwhile, I will continue to buy DVDs and watch shows that should still be on TV, but they were launched by television by religious zealots, so we could watch "quality" shows like Family Guy and American father and The Simpsons a bunch of nonsense that is).
