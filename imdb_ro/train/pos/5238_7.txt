I liked Top Gun. He cared for me. Predictable land, decent character development and story line. It is quite similar to High Noon in that the people in the city seem impoverished and scared to rise to a villain. This movie has some quality actors who really did not have the chance to share all their talents. Also, some actors did not get credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a good man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did everything he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine as a gunman. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a hard character. It seemed pleasant that two men fought over her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
