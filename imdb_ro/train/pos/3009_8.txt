A movie that is so much a 30-year Warners movie in an era where each studio has had a look and a great style at their departure, unlike today where simply getting the audience is the object . Curitz was one of Warners' house directors who worked with tight and efficient economy, while creating qualities and working methods that were largely the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the largest five big companies producing quality movies for their big chains in theaters. Even if we have a set of upper classes on Long Island, there's the Warners generic style embedded here with a narrative that could have been "ripped off titles." Another example is when the photos comment on the girls' feet at the start of the film and comment that "Not the Trophies" gives the film a much more active feeling on the ground, for they were the public that Warners were targeting in the great depression. (Ironically, Colombia and Universal were the two minors under these five major until the 1950s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have done that very cheaply and without talent and Polish) Curtiz created a film which moves along the fast rhythm while keeping the viewer at the camera's extraordinary angles and fast editing. Thank heaven, there is no sub-parcel of interest for love, so the fun can continue to roll.
