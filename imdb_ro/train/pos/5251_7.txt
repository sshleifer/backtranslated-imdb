well "World Wayne" is long gone and the years since then have been difficult for snl off-movie movies. from such kinematic organs as Path to the 80-minute cascade, "One Night at Roxbury," many have undoubtedly lost the belief that any other scenario will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. do not be afraid, not because Tim Meadows comes through the spike. the written script keeps the audience's interest until the end of it and while it remains true to the character of Leon Phelps introduced in the five-minute skit, the story allows the character to grow. humor (which mostly consists of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than I have in any movie in my recent memory. it's a wonderful time if you do not feel like you got too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of fame "Saved by the Bell" makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. eventually Billy Dee Williams, re-playing Colt 45 days, gives the film a class note. and for those who are quirky movies such as me, you'll find this movie as eminently cozy, "Oh, it's a lady!"
