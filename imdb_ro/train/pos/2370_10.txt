It's a great American martial arts movie. The battle scenes were quite impressive for the American film made in the 1990s. Of course, battle scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong movies, in fact, only a few American films have battle scenes that are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even today. When you watch the American martial arts movie, you expect to see the less impressive battle scenes, but still having beautiful, sometimes surprisingly good moves, or at least that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed with this movie. Some of the battle scenes were really impressive, the act, the direction and the plot were pretty good, so it's worth watching the movie if you like the American martial arts movies of the 1990s.
