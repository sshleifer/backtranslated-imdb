Recap: It's as usual in Louanger's casino in Tanger. The casino is about to close and prepares for a big deal the next day. Owner Louche and some employees leave at night, leaving Modesty responsible. Suddenly, a band of armed gangsters plunged the casino, shooting wildly. Unknown to Modesty, they already killed Louche and are now after the money hidden in the vault. But no one is present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault. The temple itself is strongly captured with explosives, so attackers can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty was staring in Miklos's eyes in a life-threatening roulette game. Comment: This is a written review that has nothing to do with what has ever happened with other published media about Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read anything about it. The first point I like to say is that this is slightly wrongly classified. First of all, I thought it was a thriller with a battle of intelligence between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some explosions of action, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. As I have already mentioned the main plot and the main stage with suspense, it's the game between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and exciting way to reveal the background of a character, and so many of the stories take place outside the casino in a much earlier time. Someone said he was almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling is that he could really be used as such. But, I felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others did. I was not in any way disappointed with the lack of action, but I enjoyed this game, history much more than a simple action movie. I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, did very well. Staden specifically describes Modesty very well, and really carries this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
