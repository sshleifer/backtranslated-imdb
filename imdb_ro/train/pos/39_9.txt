This is obviously one of Shemp's first pants with Stooges. (This excludes much earlier with the team for years). But the comedy timeline of the Threesome is the best. Apart from the intense harassment scenes, there are also more subtle but equally funny scenes. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or watch the real object that provokes Moe's exclamation: "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" Emil Sitka is the weirdest scientist. And the goon might seem scary, but it's kind of funny. He seems equally frustrated and puzzled by Stooges, because they are "ordinary" people in other shorts. For Shemp enthusiasts, this is an episode must have. You will not disappoint.
