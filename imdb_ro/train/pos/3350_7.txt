I do not remember seeing this before tonight, probably the title sounded so habitual that it always went through my job. But it is a good, well designed West, with an intriguing story comfortably complemented by the action of coming from good to horn. Robert Mitchum slides into a wide open city looking for his wife and news of their daughter, and rests for a while as a city. As usual, good businesspeople have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the bad, but also the business they bring. However, it applies: laws on relaxation drinks and gambling and encouraging industries, but claims to deplore the effects they can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating about this film is Mitchum's intense cinematic portrait of clearing the wicked city and accepting the people that his violent methods were the only ones. A bit preferred: the sudden loss of 2 baddies in the Red Dog salon. The burning of the main salon was clumsy, but it was an effective way of fighting the spread of poisons. Generally, a very good movie, with the only mistake, tends to be a little hockey - not so good for Do-Buni, who would probably prefer a life of negotiation with the evil rather than conclude it.
