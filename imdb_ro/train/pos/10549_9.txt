I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it will be launched on a large scale, because I want to see it again! It's a character-based film, and Andrew and David are more than just a task. Any discussion about the plot could be considered a spoiler, so I'm just saying the story is smart, the act is gorgeous, and the effects are amazing. Well filmed and well-paced too. One of the best movies I've seen over the course of time, and very refreshing in this terrible summer movie <br /> <br /> He had the audience laughing all the time. See if you can. (I especially liked the Candy bar! Candy bar scene!
