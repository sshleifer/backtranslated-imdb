In Carmen, Saura once again tries to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passions of the personalities of a dance company that prepares choreography for the portions of Carmen's work and the passions of the Carmen fiction, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (read non-observance of fidelity) and its ability to lead crazy men with desire. Saura used the same vehicle fiction / reality in an earlier black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tensions between the blood-dancing dancers have shown to their advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story that would be accomplished by directing their emotions to their roles in Carmen, the parallel between the little, libidinal desires of the band's dancers during the rehearsals and the spirit of the Carmen bride never comes close to being credible. It remains a gadget and, for this reason, a bitter distraction. You really have to see the blood wedding near Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it does not matter, the Saura melodrama tries to impose on Carmen, because Flamenco dance and guitar music of rehearsals - which represent 95% of the film - by some of Flamenco's most famous dancers and musicians, entry. An erroneous movie and a wonder: perfect for an exercise in Keats's "negative ability," maybe?
