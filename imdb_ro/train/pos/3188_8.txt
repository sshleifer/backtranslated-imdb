I was almost the worst day of my life. Then I hit this cute movie, I saw it and now we are ready to go out and kiss a street lamp. I have to admit I saw it only for 2 reasons: VERA-ELLEN's legs. But it's even more. The plot is actually quite smart and creative weaving. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its delightful misunderstandings. And, of course, there is ... VERA-ELLEN LAW. The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version we bought (Mill Creek Entertainment's "100 Classics Family") did not have the best quality of the video and we heard the same about Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are about too large, so a lot of scenes seem to be bleached especially when Vera dances in a white dress. But I assume you can play with your TV controls to compensate. I can not imagine how she looked on the big screen in the '51s. Stage sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and delightfully creepy - in a vein "Doctor Caligari's Cabinet". As for the love story, this is perfect. It is not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, your poor poor, your miserable life will not be as charming as this. Har har. Wait, why laugh? My life is as bad as yours. Oh damn. It's time to watch this movie again.
