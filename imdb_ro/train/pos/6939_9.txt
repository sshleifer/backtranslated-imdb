I was very impressed with this movie. I should appreciate it as one of the best Western classics. I say this for everything that happens: action, mature dialogue, senseless story, and excellent cinema. Director Anthony Mann, who made several well-filmed movies around the same era, also made Westerners such as this one. It has the same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart have collaborated on several Westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, we recommend Mann-Stewart "Bend Of The River". In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart), who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won in a fair and square contest. Then it is stolen and passed from the villain to the villain. All those villains are interesting characters. Aide Stewart deals with this interesting story: Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J.C. Flippen. Everyone is fun to look at. But it was a bit stretch to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have it all.
