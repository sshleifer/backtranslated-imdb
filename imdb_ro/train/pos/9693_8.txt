I was very surprised by this movie. I have been touched by the lives that the paul has touched along the way to find her "marie" the little girl she was separated from. Humor was also very good and did not hurt the story, as I thought it would probably do. In fact, I was expecting a "paulie wants a cracker" to joke to hurt this movie, but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very thrilling when the paul is in the press conference the research lab. So if you want to see a good "animal talking" movie, check this out, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprising twist in the end, which is also very beautiful, too.
