49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) 11-year-old Anna Bedtime illness (Charlotte Burke) has only drawings to keep her company. Her health worsens progressively as a series of mysterious "outs" get off her. In each of these episodes he dreams of a house in a deserted field, with only an invalid sick boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) living in him. When a dark and unknown danger threatens the idyllic "paper", Marc's life is endangered. Her life is also in jeopardy because these dreams reflect her health. Criticism: Haunting is the first debut from British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, she leaves a lot of other "original" fancy works behind her. Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give it a fabulous mix of reality to make it work in the form of a movie. Director Rose successfully surprises the fantastic world of children, along with a darkness that tries to usurp them. Feverishly by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with an expert "jump on the chair" moments. Most thrillers are very negligent in this very important aspect of scaring the audience in not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way she captures the suspense and never lets him go or leave slowly in the next sequence of events. Also, his mastery of placing objects in the frame (as in P.O.V.'s images) gives cinema an added dimension that it would otherwise not seem to have. Only in Europe will you find places as threatening as those presented here: lonely house, fields, coastal towns, watchtowers, etc. Rose will watch this movie with "Candyman" (1992) a real "thoughtful" horror gem and a bona fide bold fervor favorite.
