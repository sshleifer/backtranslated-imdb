Great action from Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopic to reach the screen in a certain amount of time. While covering most of Bettie's younger life, he also manages to stay on a more focused path, which means that most biographical films seem to be missing. There is a wonderful and alarmingly funny subtext in dialogue and action. This movie is a great break from Dir. from "American Psycho," and I think this will be shown by the best work so far. Oh, and like a boy in cinema, I give this movie 100% to the cine department. It was amazing how well an aspect of the 1950s fired with modern film stocks. Accolades at D.O.P. Around very pleasant. I would recommend any interested person to see it: 8/10.
