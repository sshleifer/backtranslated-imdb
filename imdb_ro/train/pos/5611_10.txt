I saw this movie at a time when I was shy about the idea of ​​moving to my apartment and starting my life alone. Maybe that's why I took him so seriously. I totally believed in the psychological degradation of the villain's character within a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice and degradation. I give him all the credit for Polanski's skill in his direction, his play and his script, but I fainted unavoidably during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the theater manager's office. Luckily for me, my life on my own did not prove as disastrous as that (so far), but I have always maintained great respect for an artist who can achieve such illusions and so everything sink in reality ( fake) he is trying to convey. Simply, man is a genius of the first order and a credit for the human race. This film is the sum of numerous, many cases of great action and great casting. Because some shows were conducted in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas, among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I of all the heart I recommend, if it happens to be bilingual, to switch audio from French to English and vice versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on the Paramount DVD. This film is a part of Polanski, the so-called "block trilogy," also including "Repulsion" and "Baby's Rosemary." Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still did not make a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, the three movies would make a magnificent boxset.
