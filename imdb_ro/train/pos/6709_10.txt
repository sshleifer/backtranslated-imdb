What I like about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and is an explosion to experience their love, humor and daily adventure. The magic literature is so diverse, portraying the ideas of classic, medieval and modern magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the teenage witch, this show is so fun and unique because it allows us to experience a lot of modern witchcraft worth seven seasons! This show has so many special qualities, and it's a joy to see Sabrina live his daily life in the mortal and the "other" world. I would recommend this to any family, because the TV series is pure, fun and adventurous. Classical!
