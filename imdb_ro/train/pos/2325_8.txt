Reese Witherspoon plays Dani, a young girl who falls crazy about her new 17-year-old, Court, played by Jason London. The court is trying to make Dani understand that the difference between their ages would make an unlikely love relationship. Soon Dani's charming love begins to win over the will of the Court. Next goes into the encounter of Dani's bigger sister, played by Emily Warfield, and the beginning of a short-lived love / jealousy problem. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston round out the cast. This is a fresh, free spirit; but unimaginable drama that reaches deep. Feel free to cry.
