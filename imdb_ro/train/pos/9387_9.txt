As others have commented, we have checked this after Siskel and Ebert mentioned this as one of the top 10 films of the year. What gift. Then I went to buy it, just to borrow it. <br /> <br /> The best share? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on his cabin. When Cage goes down, he apologizes. - I'm sorry if I scared you. Yoakum threw his gun in front of Cage with "Looks I'm Afraid?" A bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. It was really a sense of fun for that. The constant observation of the "Welcome to Red Rock" signal causes a sigh and a smile of smile. The music created a hunt, an extraordinary quality for the movie that reminded of "Twin Peaks". Unlike the Twin Peaks, however, it does not spoil things by going too far outward, the need to "up" itself. I admit watching loans for 15-20 times. You see, "Thousands of miles from nowhere" (perfectly chosen) by Yoakum playing as a curved freight train down to the desert floor. . with snowy mountains in the distance. It was incredible, framed in fluidity. In addition, I have never seen a better unification of vision and sound on the film. It also fits perfectly with the story.
