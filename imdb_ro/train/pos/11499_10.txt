Since she was just a kid when this show was first released, I just got the DVD and I wanted more episodes to be shot. This show was a 70s version of the TV series "X-Files" of the 70s - but with a bit more of a comic / easy approach. But do not misunderstand me, some of these episodes are terrible, many of them having quite a lot of plots (of course, it was the imagination of course - this was the television of the 70's). Some of the plots in which a bit silly, as well as the act, but which is the charm and attraction for this series. Whether you like drama, comedy or science-fiction / horror, this series has brought you all together. Each episode came in about 50 minutes or so (1 hour with advertisements) and that 50 minutes pass quickly, always letting me want more. An excellent classical performance that was undervalued in my book!
