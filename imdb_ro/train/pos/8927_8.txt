Clair Denis returns to the theme of alienated parents, men who pursue definite happiness without having any emotion on the family, but while Nénette and Boni in the previous film live in a narrow world in Marseilles, our exam on Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the French-Swiss border halfway through the world, in Korea and Tahiti. Again, the film begins in the middle of the course, and Louis, in the sixties, faces a heart in difficulty while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is not alien to violence, because his booth is the location for smuggling and shooting. Louis sleeps with a big knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is not in a hurry to move the action, and we have to patiently build Louis's understanding of his daily activities and the few people he does along the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and wisp of mustache) that rejects him as a "madman": presented as a father dedicated to two. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly unrelated, give the impression of Louis and his environment. Mrs. Godard's filming works are full of joy here. The control metaphor is Louis's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to look for another son that has not been found, and where Ludovic's new heart rejects him as Sidney has rejected the old one. We are accustomed to making short scenarios in Denis' film, which are inexplicable: Nénette conceals Boni feeding on a spoon; a journey by shooting Boni's father and then Boni's shortest image of a shot wounded in his head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a corpse of a transplant scar, but with Sidney's body. The implication of the last two is a rejection, real or imagined by a father, killing something indefinitely in a son.
