While the musicals were not showcases of the choreographers, we had such wonderful movies as this one. Being a great fan of Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to finally see this movie. It's not a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but pretty close. Some of the American humor of the vade, slippery, not the sorcerer's wizard, contradicts Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But overall, the American banter makes American characters look more real than cartoon cartoons. Some inventive inventions for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairy floor with rotating floors and funny mirrors, for the lack of a Busby Berkley above the number of top dance. It seems more realistic, if you could imagine that people start singing and dancing how real they are. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do not harm the film, but allow for a dynamic of the different character to appear. It's also nice not to have a clever interest, crack and love. Instead, we have a gentle, daring love, much more in line with Wodehouses's young aristocratic female.
