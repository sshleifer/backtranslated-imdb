Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in Ruins - portraying the future not too distant as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, in the worst sense of the word. Once one swallows the premise that all modern technologies can be removed by "Pulse," it offers a fun landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / Bicycle Messenger) and Logan (the Rich Rebel). It seems to be uneven, maybe as a result of a variety of authors, but is supported by Jessica Alba, energetic, beautiful and delightful, who seems so strong and uncomfortable but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
