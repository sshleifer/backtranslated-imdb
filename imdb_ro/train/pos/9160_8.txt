In all the comments that praised or condemned Dalton's performance, I thought he was excellent. He does not interpret Rochester as a bad boy, but as a rough and powerful man. I liked this version, although the movie was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St John were never gelled. Give this 8.
