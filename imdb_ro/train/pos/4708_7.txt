Yeah, Keaton looks like he liked to make this movie. With a jump in his step in striped costumes, he will remember Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young man who only pays the medical bills from his mother and sends his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to the law school. No one knows that Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does not like Johnny a bit (& I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a beautiful song / dance routine while Johnny enjoys it. I love the song when I'm in the escape machine always changing! The cop who "calls all the cars" is the Captain of Gilligan Island! See this for the gangster laughter of the 1930s! The bands in this movie are hilarious, but you have to catch them or you will lose them! Look in the background of each scene.
