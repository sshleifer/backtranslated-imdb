I remember vaguely about seeing this when I was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally recorded everywhere but a few seconds with another cartoon. Then I was 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and when I got it better, I thought it was a good movie then. A few weeks ago (June 2006), when I re-discovered it due to internet articles / videos and it's not the same movie. I'm sure he's still good with the kids, but for us 20-30 something, he surely has "Cult Status" written everywhere. It is a shame that the original production has gone through a painful process; if Fox gave him enough time, he will probably be more recognized today in the public eye. Maybe if I had to remake it with a completely different story and a whole-star voice could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than wonderful.
