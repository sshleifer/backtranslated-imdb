I feel like Monarch Cove was one of the best written and action series "Drama" to come in any network for a long time. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a great Primetime soap. People are looking forward to this type of acting while we are "TV Reality" overstretched. I want the type of writing and action that looks like Dallas, Landing the Nodes, Dinastia, Melrose Place, etc. Monarch Cove has updated this concept pretty well and anticipated it is improving. There are so many to expand with these characters and they were very exciting and captivating in themselves. It would be a waste not to explore this and to develop these characters after we have drawn and embraced us in their world. I liked the show absolutely because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without going overboard or offensive. I liked.
