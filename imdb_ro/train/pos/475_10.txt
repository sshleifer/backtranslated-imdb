Again, proving his amazing versatility, John Turturro plays an introspective Russian chess genius, preparing for a rebound tournament, and making an unlikely relationship with a resident resident (Emily Watson) at an Italian hotel in the 1920s. They are falling in love with the horror of her mother in social climbing (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story, whose cheek shine might appear as a brain. But, despite his origins in a story Nabakov, it certainly is not. Romantic elements and the sense of time and place have defeated the hands of psychological analysis. John Turturro, after appearing in "Barton Fink," "A brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves he is not dependent on Coen Bros to support his stature.
