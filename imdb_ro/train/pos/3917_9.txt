I saw the first movie when it was released in the US in 1984. I have seen it several times several times. What strikes me about the film is the incorporation of rehearsal art into characters' life and vice versa. Throughout the movie, the two intersect, and sometimes someone is never too sure to look at the characters' lives or a scene from a rehearsal. It continues until the climax of the film. All these years, later, my friends and I still love to debate if Carmen is really stabbed or not at the end. From the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized crime, the debate is open. The passion of dance, the quality of the act, the love of art and the glamor of performance combine to create a gorgeous film that again combines and overturns the line between life and art.
