Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong involvement of the spectator with his films, placing the world of the film in the middle of the real world and the imagined world. As spectators, we think we're seeing a "true" story, though we're very manipulated, often to the point where the movie is disturbing (Dance in the dark) or painful (Idiot / Idiot). Of course, Dogme movies acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating a welcome spot on Von Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance relationships with everyone else, but soon becomes a victim of the problems that others have created in the past for themselves. The ideist must inevitably reject society to remain idealist and become a terrorist. Humankind is spoiled, and purity only leads to (self-) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical subtleties (even humorous) about the role of Germans and Americans in Germany after the war . /> As a technical achievement, the film is greatly designed: changing and blurring of washed colors, screen overlays, action on different surfaces (filming the most interesting mayor of the city hall). In this film, we can see how well von Trier's film is about a technical environment. In his later works he seems to resign from this (as if he is no longer interested in technical achievements because they become so readily available).
