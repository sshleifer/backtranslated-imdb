Although this show has been in the air since 1973, after watching a DVD set that we borrowed at our library, I felt compelled to say a little about it. I remember when it was the only color show on TV in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a small "Night Night Party" with friends watching this on NBC on one of the few color televisions. I'm very happy with history not so much about names and dates, but how it influences us today and how much it can be so deep on the most inconclusive actions of time. The case from the point of view: Virginia City, Nevada, which has become one of the richest cities in the world thanks to silver, took its name from a character called "Old Virginny", which fell in the early days of the city and broke the whiskey bottle. Old Virginny did not want to miss the opportunity for the precious liquid to sneak into the dirt he decided to crown in the city of Virginia Town. The area became known as "Comstock Lode," because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim, and the area became known as Lost Comstock. I just watched an early episode that he shared with these two subjects. Other episodes deal with Mark Twain's literary growth, while a reporter for the Territorial Enterprise ... It was a healthy (and often educative) family fun. As someone else noticed, each episode would indeed be considered a movie in its own right - scriptures and rich characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that breathed the truth was the rapprochement of Virginia City and Ponderosa. Indeed, to travel from Ponderosa (all of the North Tahoe Lake), he would have had to ride his horse about 1,000 meters down the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) in the Carson Valley, then a another 30-40 miles to Virginia. <br /> <br /> Needless to say that Cartwrights would have some rear ends that do so regularly. But each writer should have some freedom with the truth. How I miss that show even today.
