are highlighted by this feature of 1917. The Clan's pride tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan leader after her father's death. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers live the simple lives of "fishermen." My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the movie multiplies with some amazing ocean views, and the booth room is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this nice film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have just been written for her: the plucky young woman is unlucky. The Pickford whip that beats lazily villagers to the church is very funny. And the final scenes of the sunken ship are very well done. It's not a great Picford movie, but it's still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the interest of love and is good as the boy on the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I could not see it. My copy scatters a lot of bells and gongs and adds a strange feeling when the village alert bells are past. Very effective.
