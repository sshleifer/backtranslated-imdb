If you've ever seen the trailer for "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will not have to watch that movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance also had revelatory trailers manufacturers. The story of the Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and science-fiction elements belong all over the world. The special thing about the Renaissance is its visual style, not its story. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but very stylized in black and white with extremely sharp contrasts. The result seems amazing (although the 3D animation problems of human beings are still visible from the time to the present: slightly robotic movements, light facial actors in wood, etc.) As a beautiful beautifully styled, beautiful beautification, Renaissance manages to astonish audience visually. Story and writing, however, are not at the same level of quality as visual imagery. It's not a bad story (and probably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original and is getting worse. Several rows of dialogue were painful, making writing sound like the beginner's first effort. I will definitely recommend the Renaissance to my friends. It is different from anything I have seen before, visually, and I think its originality only makes it a useful experience. It is also a visible story, even if it is not perfect.
