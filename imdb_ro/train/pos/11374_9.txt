There are some excellent comments and remarks about this movie. I was pleased to note the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's abortive remake with David Wayne slightly). The true bastard is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking his frustrated sexual anger over his victims - mostly children. It is the goal. The real bastard is the bureaucratic Soviet system that drowns, drowned in its own corrupted incompetence. Frustration of a man without compromise (Rea in his best role in "The Crying Game"), a lightweight pragmatist who wants to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland is always successful in this role), hesitant, frightened, (incomparable Max Sydow), the bourgeois bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant British actor John Wood), and the quiet wife, supported by the investigator (immersing supporter, Imelda Staunton). It's a beautiful movie. Its darkness and sensation are supported by the representation of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to sink into the dazzling sensationalism that has characterized so many recent movies. Gore is present - it's a strange story - but it adds the image of a pathologically twisted human being. The success of this story is precisely that these are acts committed by a person, by a man like you or me. If you and I choose to distract our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo has taken the wrath of the most innocent and most vulnerable of us, our children. The superb premise of this story is manifested by an equally excellent cast of excellent actors. - I noticed that our Australian friend did not like the speech and no doubt would have liked to hear them speaking in the Australian dialect. Well, too bad. This beautiful movie worked for me and everyone else talked to who he saw.
