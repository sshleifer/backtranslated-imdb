This is a good documentary about the intriguing world of the Indy Car. The photo is simply remarkable. The scene was Mario Andretti driving the old New England road racing lined with the ancient maple leaves blown by the speed of the car is incredible. The movie loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like to watch cars driven to the limit, you should see this movie.
