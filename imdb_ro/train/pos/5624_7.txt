I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotion he was supposed to have gone through the shot after the repetition did not think. It was a very hard movie to watch, the subject is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman who is abused for what seems to be an eternity. In fact, I felt that everything had deflated to some extent when her friends returned home, and I found no such plausible conclusion. The director seemed very eager to use the height in his blows and liked to use reflections in the mirror, I think he should have paid more attention to the rhythm of the second half of this song. I'm sure this makes a big piece of theater, this film for me, though worth it, has just fallen.
