This is an excellent, inconvenient movie. It is by far the best thing I have ever seen describing the current reality in Latin America ... abductions, corruption, ruthless police officers and greedy hearts and heart chaos towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton offers, in my opinion, the best performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is marvelously written and portrayed, I thought every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are wonderful as always. Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. I would have liked to see more of them. Authentic locations are remarkable. Working with the room is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, making it even more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I recommend this film.
