This is a great British movie. An intelligent script with many quoted lines that captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can make to a man over a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent along with the least appreciated by British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles, with a tangled joint, is a master casting casting, and Gary Stretch with his stunned gaze brings something strange to the atmosphere. Though it seems to be billed as a motorcycle movie, I think it will find an audience outside of it, only on the premise that many people have been there and made the jersey. also an original original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This could indeed be a heir to the 21st century of the famous Ealing comedy. Like the weeds in the fields of Wales: it is a cultivator!
