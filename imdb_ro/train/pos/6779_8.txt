George Cukor directs a bizarre and cynical classic. Distinguished Ronald Coleman is the best in this piece of Noir about an actor losing his roles. The appearance of Anthony John (Colman) led his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) away from her highly temperamental temperament and irregular behavior. But the two manage to continue working together to please the audience. Things begin to change as John gets bored of his career; he does not hesitate to play Othello. He becomes deep in character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to cross a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and ultimately killing his mistress (Shelley Winters), but he has no memory of strange facts. in this role. Winters is very impressive as a young woman determined to escape her unhappy life. Also in distribution: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
