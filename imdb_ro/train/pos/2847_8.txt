As is generally known, anthology films do not behave very well with American audiences (I think they prefer a standard plot). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of antological films dealing with cities and people who live and love in them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really liked. The film was composed of several segments, each written and directed by a different director (most of the French, but there is a very fun segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like Paris, this is an anthology directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur etc.) and also the city they live in. She has a top nomination with Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and veteran veterans like James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories are really flying, and others do not (though I suppose it will depend on individual tastes - I will not destroy it for anyone else by revealing those who have worked for me and who have not done it). The word is that the next series will be Shanghai, China (not Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece)? Spoken mainly in English, but has bits of Yiddish and Russian language with subtitles in English. Evaluated "R" by MPAA for strong content of language and sexual content
