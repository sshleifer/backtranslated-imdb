After seeing your mail and feeling disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired her, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed by this movie. It's a real jewel and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The actress is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen it, I want to urge you to see it today. I am not against re-making and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time I must admit that Ai Got Mail is a poor adaptation of this classic. Do not miss out, go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today!
