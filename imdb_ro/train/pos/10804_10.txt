Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I moved happily to the canal, showing that at first. Pachelbel's first Canon brought me a bit in my throat, and then the sight of a moth of Tiger (which my grandfather, my father and I flew all of) gave a slight dampening around his eyes, and then Crowe's name full content. I was excited about this movie, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt we owe), the way we tackled and treated various issues, the flight sequences (and my father flew Avro Ansons) the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not destroy the film for anyone, but apart from my 1,000-year-old wife as a former army officer who has been deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I admit I've been crying several times. Buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but look at it. PS I spied Bristol Blenheim on the aisle? It resembles a two-engine aircraft with a double-.303 tunnel in a dorsal spindle.
