I admit that I have no idea what to expect before I see this very stylized piece. It could have been the healing of a zombie virus or common cold for everything I knew. It began with large images, small fragments to attract your attention and to make you boast your imagination. As he continued, I quickly learned, by voice, what had happened. A little neo noir story that I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time. The little clues given to the audience through the visual at first give them a sense of accomplishment as they make up the plot. Along with a beautiful twist at the end of a cold package as a whole. The score, though not bad, gave the film almost a musical movie. He felt a little dated without adding anything to continue the story. Some of the shows felt too dramatic, but they fit perfectly with the feel of the whole piece. I'm going away from this very satisfied. I was given a lot of information in a short period of time, but by great editing and voice work she did not feel too fast or pushed. Good job!
