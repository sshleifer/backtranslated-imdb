My father, Dr. Gordon Warner, was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg in front of the Japanese and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my father was the technical advisor of this film and I hope he had an impact on the film making him look like he really was then, as I read in various commentaries written by viewers this movie seemed like real life. My father is a fan of facts and figures, and he always wanted things to be seen as they were, so I would like to think he has something to do with it. Currently, she lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, she is Japanese), and a few years ago she was given one of the highest recommendations from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities to bring Kendo and Iaido back to Japan since McArthur banned World War II. My father once was a sailor, but I know that once you are a sailor, you are always a sailor. And this is exactly what he is and I love him and he respects him very much. I'd love to be able to watch this movie if someone has a copy of it. And I would like to give it to my father for the 94th anniversary this year!
