Richard Willaims is an animated god. He was prevented from directing this film to the producer. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very complicated story, but some amazing animation moments (such as Emery Hawkins' Greedy). Joe Raposo's repetitive music does not help. It was made on the widescreen, so VHS does not show it in all the glory, let's hope for a small-format DVD one day. However, it is worth watching for an eye-catching animation.
