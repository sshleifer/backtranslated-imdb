Although I bought the DVD when it came out for the first time and I've seen it several times, I never wrote a review. I liked when I saw him for the first time and I still like it. Unfortunately, it seems he has never done enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill makes a movie so real to cartoons and books as My Name is Modesty, with another tough female ruler, anyone who is not familiar with the character will see that Peter O'Donnell writing his stories to focus more on psychological suspense than on thrillers of action. Drawing the wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, suspenseful and fascinating for anyone who does not have to have gore and explosions. Alexandra did a great job in playing O'Donnell's character, who would have taken control of the situation. It seems to me particularly in front of the curve after Batman and James Bond's reboots. After two previous efforts, though not as well known to the public, this is a reboot of Modesty and it is very sad that they will probably no longer be filmed about it.
