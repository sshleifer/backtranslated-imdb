John Waters made the most effusive, heart-filled, dark, dark, personal film that I think I've ever seen (maybe Fast Food Fast Women comes in close seconds) The vision of the directors is untouched ... the narrative is capricious, the characters are personal and strange reflections of the family and their own inner life ... the tone has never been forced or architecturally. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious design, inclusion or review of the magazine .... Martha Plimpton is amazing as sister .. Eddie furlong is inspired by casting. A grandmother with a mother who talks to Mary with tea, recycled clothing, yesterday's garbage becomes the art of today - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can have is the family ... and a humble life.
