There are two things that I like Elvira, and they are both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered: her intelligence and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show how funny it can be or how it's paying attention. Looking like a clone combined by Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits a legacy of a distant relative just to discover that she is indeed the inheritance of the occultes. Comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could be more scary and cooler. It's more of a camp reserve with so many horror movies horror in it, like the mob riot or the heroine fleeing traveling and stumbling on the heels. My favorite part is when she uses her wonderful equipment to break the chains by holding her in the cemetery. The ending is sweet, as if written by Bradys, but the act in Las Vegas seems too grandiose for this type of movie.
