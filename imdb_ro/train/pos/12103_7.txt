I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I did not like and I was always a sucker for a good story in the haunted house (especially for such wonderful pictures as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of the movie " The Haunting "and" House on the Haunted Hill ") so I had the feeling that the" Blood Castle "would be right on my driveway. And boy, it was ever! This French-Italian co-production, perhaps not Steele's classic film, "Black Sunday", which remains to this day, is an extremely atmospheric and cold-like entry in the spook genre. Filled in black and white, he manages to convey a truly creepy miasm. The film refers to a journalist who bets a Blackwood lord and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood Castle on the Night of All Saints' Day when the spirits of those killed in the castle resume their fate. The visitor gets to see these deaths and, for the most part, they are pretty horrible. The movie really sends sparkle to the spectator's back, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched - thanks to Synapse - it even has a surprising topless scene and easy lesbianism! Barbara is great in this film; her brilliant beauty is advantageous, playing a sympathetic spectrum. Its simple presence turns a ghostly ghost story into something really memorable. Not because she was called the "Queen of Terror".
