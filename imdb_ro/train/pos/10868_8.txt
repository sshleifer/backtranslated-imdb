I always thought it would be a long and boring speech movement that would be full of static weather, man, I was wrong. "Election" is a fascinating and exciting thriller drama, having a profound and realistic vision behind the triad-ritual origins. Characters are always on the move and although you are always an outsider as a viewer, it is still possible to feel the suspense caused by certain character decisions and ambitions. In addition, Johnnie To manages to create truly opulent images thanks to meticulously compound illumination and atmospheric light contrasts. Although there is almost no action, the conclusion is still shocking in the ruthless description of brutality. A great movie that deserves more attention and I have liked the minimalist acoustic guitar score pretty little.
