When it comes to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one who made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had a whole life stolen by two bad and nasty brothers and a mother-in-law who runs slavery. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we need to see Cinderella in animation. Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are alone and rich beyond their needs. to share his fortune and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father marries a woman, but then dies afterwards. the stepmother, just seeing the dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her beautiful daughter, Cinderella. So, for many days, Cinderella is slave to her stepmother and her sisters. she hopes, though, because of her friends, the mice at home (it sounds like Cinderella did not play with a full deck), she hopes that one day she will find her prince. the chance finally comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend. 9/10
