After seeing Charley Boorman on Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested in seeing Charley in his show. I thought Charley came as a great guy who's very grounded and down on the ground. It's nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness, it looks just their man! I do not know much about motorcycles, but this show hit me right from the start. Preparing and organizing for this event seems immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else do it and how far it goes. I like the rhythm of the show and the fast optimistic music. I can not believe she broke his collar bone, I really hope it's not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
