I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It's the humorous humor that made me chic all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so high, stimulates the comedy of the movie. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseball on DVD and just one of those movies where you never get tired of watching. I have a very short period of attention and I think this movie has so many funny bits that I worry all the time. The humorous quotations are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember later. So generally, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, especially if you're younger because it will make you laugh a long time afterwards. <br /> <br /> Ps.And someone weird thinks for me to like both of them? hehe
