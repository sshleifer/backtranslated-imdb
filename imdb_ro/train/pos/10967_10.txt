I first saw this movie during my Tulane songs. I was delighted by how beautiful and brutal this documentary was. It is a sincere look in the untouched reality of a life of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought she really showed Little Edie at her heart. ** As a side note My teacher even told me that during the filming Little Edie became infatuated with one of the men in the room. ** Beauty, I find, comes from the nature of the family dysfunction. It is obvious in the relationship between mother and daughter that no one can work only in society and you will begin to want to rehabilitate your society at Little Edie. In total, the film collapses in its aesthetic quality and is the portrayal of a surprising beauty. Two fingers up!
