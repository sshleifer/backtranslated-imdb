I watch movies to live my life to find out which ones are good enough to distribute ... Throw away those who do not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else on this one, I'm just leading you to the way I came to look at the "Lou's Gospel" ... Anyway ... So bad movies sit on my desk and I'm actually staying through all. In fact, I do not look at everything, I usually watch TV occasionally while working on scanning for the value of production, performance and how well the story is presented. If something attracts my eyes, I'll take time to look at her. "Lou" came in the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and turned my chair on the TV, so I was able to get it totally. It is useless to say that I was enthusiastic throughout the film. The story is said to be good, the characters are either bold or repulsive (depending, of course, on the intention of the director and actor for the character) and all are well played. Sometimes we have caught occasional amateur mistakes in camera and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easy to dismiss. I have heard the comments of others saying that sometimes the film brought tears to their eyes, another time of great excitement ... I was a minute and wept the next and was incredibly touched by this movie. Unfortunately, I have not been able to get it, because I was - as they say - a one-week delay and a short dollar. This is sometimes the case ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this, and I can not wait to see what kind of response she receives. Good luck and great luck for you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are no doubt a pursuing talent.
