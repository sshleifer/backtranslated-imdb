This film is nothing but a dark, hard masterpiece. I may be biased because the apartheid era is an area I have always felt. But I'd say it's class with Cry Freedom and Cry Country Beloved. Unfortunately, until a few days ago, I have not even heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underestimated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I have not even heard of it. Eric Stoltz, anyway a favorite actor, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays well in the mood. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is none. It's true, wild and rocky to the end, and the sensitive one would say I bring a box of tissues. But movies so big that it makes you wonder, why is most of the movies you often never hear?
