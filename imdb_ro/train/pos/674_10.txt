While for most people watching the movie, this will be of little interest, but of the many hundreds of movies that deal with magic and occult in one form or another, it is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> From The Golem to Craft, the subject seems to be an endless interest in the cinema industry. Most of the movies that touch it in any way make it so childish (for example, "Witchboard", a real piece of garbage in all respects), whether they take transcendental elements as cheap apologies for special effects cheese or cut-out villas of cardboard (cf "Wizard"). More frequently, the subject comes in a hysterical religious context (in the various films directed towards the Revelations, the antichrist is inevitably a lawyer of an old-style practice). Rarely, a film seems to show at least a bitter experience of magic, as is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films may at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic, or ... just not very well. I watched this movie again after many years tonight. I've seen it before on VHS; it's a dark, moody piece, and after seeing it on DVD, I'd say if you're going to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch VHS. <br /> <br /> Darkness and moodiness are in power in VHS, but in DVD the movie has a very different tone. I think Weir deliberately pushed dark aspects to style, but when the film is transformed into the inferior color of the VHS, this goes beyond the edge. The DVD brings the movie back to life and I've seen it differently. Anyway, seeing it for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie. It is difficult to enter into all the reasons why I do not care to take my time to do so. For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see how it really is, this movie is very suitable for countless levels. And for anyone who is not, you have really lost a lot of reading time at this point.
