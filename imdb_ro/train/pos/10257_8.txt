what can I say about this movie that has not been said before? good to say the truth long seems to be very fake as some of the palms and blows. as Charlie shines, though this was real I do not know. I'm sure they would have hit and would have hit harder if they were. however, scenes with grip and hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probably the only thing on the movie that ever shocked me.
