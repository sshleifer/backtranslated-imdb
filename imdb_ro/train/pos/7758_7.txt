An excessive melodrama typical of his period (mid 1950s) and matinee food. Rock Hudson, the one who always falls in love, plays the role of the usual stereotype, but in Giant that same year, when his Taylor & Dean co-stars were above average, he is just not good enough for raise the caliber beyond a strange story about how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. The self-destructing brother and sister (Robert Stack, who is making their way through the movie in a beating stupor and Dorothy Malone, playing a rich, vampire-rich girl, all over the top) gets the losers and Hudson makes Bacall - wood of this part, which does not have enough character or intelligence to make it work. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, happy ending and unhappy happy ending, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in seeing the film rely on a true story that justified the plot. Like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the film could be remodeled: Stack's character would be more shedding if it would hide homosexual feelings for Mitch's marriage. Todd Haynes, Far From Heaven, has improved dramatically on All That Heaven Permits, directed by Sirk. Maybe Haynes could fix it on Wind and give us a really memorable movie.
