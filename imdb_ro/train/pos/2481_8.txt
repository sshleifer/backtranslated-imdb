I admit that I saw only three of Shakespeare's songs (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth and Hamlet, of course), one I liked, the other I found (Macbeth) and Hamlet found a masterpiece. I am pleased to tell you that this adaptation is as good as the intense and dramatic game. The actress is extremely powerful (with a cast that tells Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) And the change of time (It seems somewhere between 17 and 1800) plays nicely as characters move and say their infamous lines directly from the script itself that any fan of the Shakespearean play will get chills. If you are in this popular drama, I recommend you to look at this powerful adaptation of Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh in 1996.
