Various film directors from different countries have contributed greatly to the film environment through their thoughts. As a result, we have experienced different genres when it comes to the environment. Jafar Panahi, unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in the simple story; The schematic diagram is one of the main features of his post. He trusts the spectator's automatic and critical intelligence; he feels no need to go to Alienation or such things to get to the viewers. It is as effective as it is conventional. Offside (2006), is another schematic creation on his part, where subordination of the Asian Middle East genre is gradually becoming clear to everyone, while the simple but capable film story progresses. Now that we are all shouting about the issue of Women's Rights, this movie moves very calmly in our minds and eventually becomes a cock for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that Equality of Human Rights is nothing but an illusory good, a utopia . Paternity will never let women be empowered. An important football match involving the nation, a teenage girl who understands the game well, loves the nation does not have the right to enter the stadium to cheer her country. It is only allowed to listen to the live commentary. Her alias could not work for her. Consequently, he had to go through several humiliating situations. From the beginning, her troubled father ran here and there for her daughter. At the end of the day, the feast came when the nation won the match that the girl did not see because it was detained on the outside of the stadium during the match. But the feast can not suppress the issue of Women's Rights that remain in every corner of the world in another format. Jafar Panahi best described this problem of gender abuse from and within the conventional film and patriarchy. A global tragedy has been treated with ease and sometimes with humor, which, in turn, tears us constantly.
