I watched this movie over 100 times and love me every time I looked at it. Yes, it can be very strange, but it's also very fun and funny. The camp presented in the film is a real camp that I actually participated in for 7 years and is portrayed as a camp indeed, a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who ever went to the camp, wanted to go to camp or sent a child to the camp should watch this movie because it will bring wonderful memories for you and your children.
