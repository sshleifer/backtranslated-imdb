The film of cult for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, with great action: it is beyond all praise. The film, as a book, is full of symbols: the most brilliant symbol of Razrukha (the Russian colloquial word for "devastation," often signifies the chaos of lifestyle after the 1918-20 civil war) opened a dirty door in the snowy wall that gleamed in the snowy wind and in the black hole of the door behind her. Now the movie is released on DVD with the completely restored image and the 5.1 sound, there are well translated English subtitles, although Sharikov's obscene words have been replaced by the lighter versions of the translation. I do not know that the DVD is available abroad, but if you find it immediately grabbed, it's really worth watching. And, in conclusion, a fact: about 50% of today's Russians, mostly young, can be identified as Sharikov to a considerable extent. The post-soviet effect: the Soviet people seems totally unprepared for the informational attack of Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the amazingly aggressive media without the soul and careless instincts of every Russian. Even among internet users, every third uses adult language in forums and chats, because it is amazingly accustomed to colloquial speech.
