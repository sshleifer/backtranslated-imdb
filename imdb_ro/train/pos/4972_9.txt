LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I will see better this year. This beautiful tragicomania of Belgian director Benoît Mariage is in the industrial deserts of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this the son must break the opening doors. What the father really wants his son to be someone, because he himself has never done as a local news reporter for an ironic newspaper called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's slides, although it is more dramatic and humor is darker. As in that movie, however, the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the end is optimistic, without being unrealistic happy. Humor is absurd without doing this incredible plot, and Mariage finds stunning images in gloomy settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the act from Poelvoorde. This actor was shot with the brilliant classic-cult classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRES OF CHEZ VOUS, in which he played a charismatic Ben hitman. Since then he has only played two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were instances of Ben character. With the return to leadership in LCA, there is no doubt about his role. It is simply brilliant as a stupid and bad man to put his family in misery, but smart enough to figure out what he has done and be broken by remorse. I need to see.
