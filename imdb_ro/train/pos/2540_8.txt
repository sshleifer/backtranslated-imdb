Although they are not so famous as some of their other collaborations (such as BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a terrible dandy movie, even if the casting decisions were a bit weird. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist living in the Carpathian Mountains - near the hometown of the Dracula character. Bela Lugosi interprets Doctor Benet - whose nationality has never been discussed, though the name sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have the two roles of change, because the Carpathian role seems to be suitable for Lugosi - especially with its emphasis. However, despite this unusual overthrow, the two have still done excellent jobs. Karloff was definitely the main role, but Lugosi paid off as a relatively normal person - something he did not play very often in movies! It turns out that Dr. Rukh is a bit paralyzed, as other scientists (especially Benet) believe that his theories are bizarre and meaningless. However, during the film, Rukh proves to be right, and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the new awesome item that Rukh has discovered has the unpleasant side effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it when this happens?). While this could have been a handsome scientist turned into a crazy story, the plot was well built, the characters developed handsome and crazy Rukh NU It was a one-dimensional but complex and interesting killer. the film is bound to enjoy anyone, except those who hate old horror movies. You can really say that Universal Pictures has taken all the stops and made a bigger movie instead of cheap speeds, both Lugosi and Karloff, unfortunately, have been gravitating in recent years. Good things.
