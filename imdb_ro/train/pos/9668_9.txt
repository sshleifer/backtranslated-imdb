This is a small movie, some theatrical characters. And yet something is said about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere. This film is IRELAND. In all that's rude, it's a sadness, it's a self-deception. The boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and, above all, Madge. I know them. kneel down to pray with them. They are our sad history and they are our presence.
