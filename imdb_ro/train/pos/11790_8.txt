David New Lynch is a very "Lynchian" play full of darkness, tension, silent, discreet background music, but highly textured and has two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in his work. > <br /> <br /> Both characters create a very interesting relationship of master-slave, which could be seen as a direct pursuit of the same type of relationship presented in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
