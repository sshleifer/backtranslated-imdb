A 14-year-old girl develops her first grave passion for a 17-year-old boy who lives almost trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film of director Robert Mulligan's age-old film. Mulligan is renowned for directing the summer summer of '42 in 1971 and killing a mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the genre of coming of age. Here he directs the newcomers into the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as a big sister; Jason London, as a Court, a 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good at her film debut, presenting every emotion a 14-year-old girl feels is lived with love and young wounds, never giving a false note. Warfield and London are both as good. The film accurately describes the thoughts or feelings of each teenager about love with a heartbeat, never going through a maudlin excess once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay by Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the few movies about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally disrespectful or sensational. Music is wonderfully simple, emphasizing tone and mood from scene to stage, but it never gets intrusive. The beautiful cinema is made by the famous horror director, Freddie Francis, who was 70 years old when he was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston sing the girls' dead parents for 1957, caregivers, strict and emotional simple. Gail Strickland is good as the boy's mother. There are feelings to solve, learning lessons and truths to do in the sweet-natal movie that has an emotional wall. So far, this is Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best movies in 1991. **** 4 stars.
