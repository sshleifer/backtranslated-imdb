This film is not a schlock, despite its loyal production and its link to Troma productions. A dark fabula for adults. Exploitation is a theme of Sugar Cookies and wonders if the distribution has not fallen prey to that theme. A strange movie with visual effects: shadows and contrast are prominent. It certainly deserves a look, especially from Warhol's fans and elegant decadence. Through all cruelty and wickedness, a moral, though twisted, can be shone.
