There is nothing brilliant, innovative or innovative, but "Dog Days" is, for some reason, an extremely fascinating study. It's as if CRASH stops in a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It's an Austrian film that tracks the lives of a few depressed, disturbed and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's disturbing, yet very well acting, and it's interesting to watch the crazy stuff these characters do. Of course, not for the weak, this extremely pessimistic film does not give any conclusion or revelation at the end, we only see the lives of these sordid individuals within two days. Grade: B
