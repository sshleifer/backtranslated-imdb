Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in life. The British Aristocratic Bleak in a viewing room, passionate about the Irish thief in the name of his father, a dull and violent butcher of the Gangs of New York (in a show ten times more powerful than Adrian Brody in a pianist) and that Cristy scandalous Maro brain paralysis to the left of my leg (just to name a few). Its role influences each, but each is separate and absolutely unique. He changes completely with each character he takes. And I'm beginning to think he can behave like anything. Anything. Like Cristy Brown he's amazing. He does not ridicule the character and not a pity of character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Man. <br /> <br /> This film, despite small stage transition faults and the like, is a source of inspiration. Yeah, it's predictable. But is it stupid sentimental? Not. I laughed. I cried. No moment of cheese. Evidence not to be a Hollywood movie. My favorite scene is the scene from the restaurant, when Cristy talks to the painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. This is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches a climax. "I will hit you in the only part of your animated anatomy." "Turn the offender!" And his performance never slows, does not doubt and is beautiful. Simply. It has a lot of screen time here. I follow him again and never get tired of Cristy's eyes, scary and guttural speeches. We have to see. Fo sho, yo!
