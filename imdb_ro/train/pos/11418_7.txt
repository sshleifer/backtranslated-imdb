I first saw this film during the course and the International Film Studies course. I am a "non-traditional" student and, probably for reasons of life or wisdom, appreciated the slow, reflective rhythm of the narrative of the film. Chains with the heat and dust of an arid climate, the story is profoundly psychological, full of multi-symbolism, and an articulated inversion of the theme of being "Other" in a country we do not understand. the understanding that comes is full of unresolved memories and the subjectivity of the stranger. Realized almost 20 years ago, it is also a precursor to a genre of many other international films exploring the themes of colonies in colonized spaces, without blemish over the nuances of the cultures in which they entered. A much more richly filmed and funded work that has been made because it reflects the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two who, in comparison, probably make Chocolat look pale and boring. It does not have action to pump adrenaline or extreme violence. Fighting is mental, emotional and subtle. But being said, it's a great movie that's worth watching.
