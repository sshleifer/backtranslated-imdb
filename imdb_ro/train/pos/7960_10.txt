In the past there have been countless animal-speaking films, most of them have animated animal mouths to match almost the voice acting or ridiculously amateur. "Homebound Bound: The Journey Incredible" is none. This film does not need the addition of children-the pleasure of the dog's moving lips, or feline limbs gestures. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals speak authentic to each other, and you can attract them emotionally to the heart (as all the wonderful movies of boys and his own should do). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the symbol of all family-friendly romps for my family, impressive <br /> <br /> Michael J.

The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) is not an equally good film but it extends the adventure of my favorite fur friends and is a fun urban fun on Grand-Outdoor-Adventure. Do you want to have your kids entertained with a mini-epic sorcerer, cute, heartless, without an idiotic and often ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing me a tear to every view of this classic early '90s!
