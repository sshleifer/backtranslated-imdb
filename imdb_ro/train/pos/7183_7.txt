This is a perfect series for family viewing. We meet around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an updated version of Robin Hood and is addressed to children and adults. Our teenager and both enjoy meeting with mom and dad and following Robin's next exploits. We can not wait for the next episode in the air every week and we are happy to watch "Free On Demand". The closet has a current fashion place. There is a moral for each story. It's fun. Violence is not obsolete or useless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with John William's sense of it. It is a story of the old world that is brought back to life with a new notion of the world. There are so many garbage on television, from the fact that TV "reality" rotting the brain to meaningless violence. You should take this for what it is and an updated "Robin Hood" not to be compared to the explosions of Errol Flynn's film. This is a jewel that enjoys everyone. Parents who are concerned about their children who follow too much violence will enjoy the fact that Robin has lost his taste for war and shedding blood. He is a Robin Hood who would prefer to try to reason his way out of a fight disagreement. Maid Marian is also an appealing model for young girls. Rather than staying away and doing nothing, it has its own role in helping the poor, being the "Watchman Night". The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously above evil, as the sheriff should be, and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by a very beautiful actor, one that makes most women want to not play a bad Guy. <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
