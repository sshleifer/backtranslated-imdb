Jackie Chan's name is synonymous with stunts. This movie has never let you down. The scene of the best debut film and the last score down the column is as risky as a miracle if it knows the meaning of fear. This film comes very close to the best Jackie, which is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars in which, as in this film, Jackie bears the film entirely on his shoulders. This is probably the main reason why this movie made Jackie the greatest martial arts star, followed by Bruce Lee. also. What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable part in the contract with the typical hero of martial arts. This movie was followed by a sequel that was good, but it was quite along with its predecessor.
