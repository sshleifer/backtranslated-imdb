I came across this movie because I had a free, free release from Blockbuster and I had to get something quick because the store was about to close for the evening. The white cover and the simple title intrigued me. I am a woman (old) relatively speaking, and my son is a 30-year-old. I wore movies that are full of fun, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview with a Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a graduate of film and enjoys highly specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. In general, we hate the movie choices of others, but anyway, I have seen and loved the movie NEVER! It was different from any movie I've ever seen. We are both guys of criminals / critics and we usually do the movies while watching them - but in this case we laughed and we enjoyed the movie from start to finish. We think that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main theaters of US streams, it would have done really well indeed.
