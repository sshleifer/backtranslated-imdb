I looked last night last night. The reasons being, I usually do not like "made for television" and I rarely enjoyed the "reunion" films. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like that, so I gave her a chance. I'm glad we did. It was quite good. Adam West and Burt Ward come together as themselves. But, in a way, they acted like "Batman and Robin". They were campy and they do not take themselves, or this movie too seriously. The film begins with them looking for the "Batman" designed by George Barris, which someone stole before he was auctioned for an orphan's home. While looking for the car, they also recall the series they did together. This is said in flashback. It was well done. The actors they receive, for the young Burt Ward and Adam West, have died. And, for a television movie, he got noticed about their real behavior on and off the screen. I give her a 9/10, I liked it so much.
