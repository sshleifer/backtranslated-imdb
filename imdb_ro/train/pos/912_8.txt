This film brings back many memories of old classical cinema, in which actors did not have to take their clothes to make viewers watch their movie. First of all, I think the main plus of this film is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely the film's making. I have seen a lot of comments about the movie being sweet and sweet. In response to this, I think to some extent this is a fair analysis, although considering it to be a Barjatya film, I think it has been toned down significantly compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost unbearable to look in some places. In this movie, however, when the sentimental moments come, you feel smiles, you want the youngster to be the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to him. Another important major point is the performance of Shahid and Amrita. Both have acted very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita looks just amazing and should be taken seriously as a major future life. Although I really liked the movie as a whole, I think it was too long. Some in the middle could have been cut and could have an even greater impact. I also think that music, although it falls into the movie when you see the situation, is a bit old and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack was available. Although the picturing of the songs by Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. In general, I definitely recommend that this movie, his romantic, looks amazing and has a dramatic climax (I will not go into detail unless you have seen it.) PS If you are prone to crying - take a tissue! (I needed more)
