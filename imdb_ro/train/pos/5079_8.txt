Well, first of all, it would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a prayer in Tamil and clearly translated means "to protect." Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). Also, the Tamil film industry is quite full of pure commercial adventures, any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie will be a testament to this statement. Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELENT movie with a great soundtrack. Definitely amazing in the final scene, she loves the end (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore is too much, sometimes, but surely this is a great movie!
