This is another tough and convincing film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his previous films - a cast with a few stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley play in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets from America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed. The film starts with Peters on a metro car tracked by federal agencies. They know it's a link to a long chain of espionage. Unknown for everyone is the wild book in the equation - a small pocket (Widmark) is also on the train and manages to steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark thinks he's just another bag he ran - only after that he realizes the seriousness of what he stole. Now it's Widmark on his own - with Commies and the hot FBI on his way. Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the movie collapses from start to finish. Although it did not get the maximum billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress probably had the performance of her life as a stall dove. She was rarely given this great chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. As for the scenario and the targeting, they are very good - but with a small exception. At first, I liked how Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times on the movie, you'll see a perforated woman in her mouth! Now it's tough. Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close - too close to being credible. However, with such a dramatic drama and a film as Noir, this can be overlooked. See this movie.
