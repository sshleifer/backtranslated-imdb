Words are not enough to convey the emotional power of this film; is one of the most frightening you will ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, delicate, and full of emotions that you can hope for. Each actor in each role is extraordinary, especially a wise and undervalued Jamie Lee Curtis, a Ray and Liotta closely wounded and scared, and a return from Tom Hulce who should have had it for each prize in the book. (He is the best actor in 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternative Oscars"). The last half hour is bordering on melodrama, but the movie wins every tear - and if you're not a rock, there will be a lot of them.
