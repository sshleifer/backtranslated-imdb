The impressive film of the four slickers of the Appalachian crisis town became synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businesspeople faces the darkest fears when faced with a difficult journey on white on a river to be replaced by a dam. When locals along the way decide to "have their way" with interlopes, it leads to more deaths and a lot of trauma to survivors. Each of the travelers is remarkable, although Voight gives the leadership and the most powerful performances. The landscape and rural culture are well captured, including the banjos dueling dueling. I saw this once it came out, not exactly the perfect date film (though we both enjoyed it). I remember this as a dramatic performance for Burt, Voight has already been established. Not a kind of movie that you can watch every week, but it has a strong punch and it's nice to shoot.
