This series was exactly what you would expect from Mr. Spielberg. It's really one of those angry, funny, childish shows that you will not forget. Just like Outer Limits (another extraordinary show), this small series does what it can not do. It was great and it's worth it to run more. It was a wonderful show, even the children could watch, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but they always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you figure out what the situation you did not want to get in, or what you did. I remember looking at some of these Sci-Fi news when I was 10 years old and right now I'm glad to see them when I can. Really a fun, imaginative show. I liked it and still do it.
