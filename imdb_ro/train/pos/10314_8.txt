This and her "Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there is something missing from this new series. It can point too much lesson to be taught. It's more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never join. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later it was remodeled in "The Lake House"). I think because I saw the first episode, so it destroyed the impact of the movie later.
