well I was a teenager when I saw the movie .. the pieces were a huge hit, but the elite class jumped over the movies govinda then watching movies govinda and karishma (aka karizma) were not working for that "class", but anyway, a lot of people liked it because the series of these films made the 1990s uncomfortable and the majority were successful ... today I followed them again after a long time and I remembered, there was a long crowd of people and the riots they created when the song aa uo uo appeared on the screen ... his govinda and karishma gowns were complementary to one another (the worst duo of clothing then) good karisma at the end but the Govinda was still very loyal to her designer that the sense of her dress remains the same ... but then everything mixed everything was fine ... everything worked and slowly the elite class did what fun was missing and then ..... no there was no look back for this iodine, as it happened, making those Indians go in the evening .. hated by a few but loved by the masses. If you are looking for a good time with nothing to rent or watch it on TV, I do not think you will regret it ... but remember it is the worst at its best .. <br /> < br /> I still watch movies when they take time and cant stop laughing ... so I say you go ahead and have a good time there are times when all of us love the stupidity and especially when done by the time of the times they are definitely watched ... they recommend it to all movie lovers ...
