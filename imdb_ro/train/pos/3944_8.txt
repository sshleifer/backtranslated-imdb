This little movie has long been on my "owner" list. People realize how stressed, menopausal, emotionally abused (as well as mentally retarded) women MUST BE treated to the medical profession at the beginning of the century? All the pioneering Christian attitudes of those times were deadly to explore TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, not to mention what it means to embrace humanity. Can you imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were forbidden because he recognized women having emotions and emotional responses as great as men? Think about this! The sensitivity of this film gets me and I credit the director for capturing him through his eyes.
