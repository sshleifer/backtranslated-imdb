I have had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film portrays how many are unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, and very unjust. From robotic sex, with agitation for gifts, for lies and betrayal, we have experienced everything in Russia. I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the pictures of my three trips to Russia looking for a bride. Includes thousands of pictures of many Russian girls I met, black comedy, the scams I was convinced of, and the story of my illness and appearance on Russian national television. Http: //www.happierabroad.com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Realitatea TV. You'll like it. I spent a ton of time putting them together. So check it out. The Russian woman Nicole Kidman plays is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photos. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The three brides who are looking for Russian travel are very interesting and would sell, so why do not I make a movie of my bride looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is a real impossibility in this movie, and this is how the guy orders his bride from a catalog and has it at an airport. It does not work at all, so I do not understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There is no single Russian brides introduction site that works this way, and I have provoked anyone to find one who does. The truth is that you can order the Russian Lady's contact address (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there, match and then visit it and if you want to bring it to your country, start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months after that. That's how it works in real life. You can not order them to get to your airport. American immigration would NEVER allow for such a thing to happen. WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I have everything I wanted going abroad!
