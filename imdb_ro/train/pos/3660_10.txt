This obscure of Sica delivers the goods. It is said that "the meek shall inherit the earth." This story of the surface class, but truly an allegory for all homeless people who have populated Europe after the Great War. They are homeless but cheerful, in a society too poor and selfish to care for them or to recognize them, captains for Italian carpets. Sica chooses to call it a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book on which I am based, so I can not predict whether deus ex machina is the construction of the writer or Vittorio. It starts with the words "Once at a time ..." to illustrate the long story of the story, because the story could be put anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy who cut off the bones, the capricious nature of homeless people, especially when they begin to give their will and a concluding right from a picture of Spielberg, make this anger a delight for all. Also, De Sica's most accessible image is one of the best. Abandoning neo-realism, he has always made a film of old age between this film, creating a film that breaks the heart, and at the same time fills him with the hope of hope that we must continue to go into this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
