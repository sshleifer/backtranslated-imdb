This movie is great. Now, I tend to like my heavy movies on the story and the dialogue, but now and so, something like Moonwalker comes and is being pursued, despite the many shortcomings. /> <br /> This movie is just a very interesting publicity for Michael Jackson. Starting with the sick video, "Man in the Mirror," a set that lists his achievements, and the bits and bobs of his career, goes through all the ages of his life, then collapses into a really fun segment that acts as a video fun for "Bad" and "Speed ​​Demon," following MJ's adventures as he runs from stop-motion maniacs and finally dancing against a rabbit suit. The stop motion is not as bad as someone thinks. It is acceptable. Then we see the great video for "Let Me Peace" and directly into the main feature. Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. We see Michael leaving a building, then shot by thousands of soldiers. Then I hit retrospectively, pointing to MJ and three children stumbling on an underground board. "Mr. Big" (Joe Pesci) is the angry bastard who has a plan to attract each child of the world to addiction to "drugs" (not to mention the specifics) from an early age. MJ and the little girl they catch, then they watched ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the big part. We get two very cold sequences, where MJ turns into a car, then into a robot-ship thing and of course in the amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. It's such a great movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of its biggest hits, some real bits, and some pretty good special effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship sequence) It's worth it, especially seen as if you could raise it for about a fan on ebay. It will keep the children quiet for several hours, as well as the 20 most children who were children when they were released for the first time.
