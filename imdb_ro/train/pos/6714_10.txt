Why did I enjoy the show in the last episode? Because of true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her supportive distribution have demonstrated that comedy, light-hearted humor, and deep thought could coexist. What I liked most was the fact that I could come home from a hard day of work and smiled at me ... I was inspired ... and why? It was a source of inspiration to see how this magical person was so happy while helping others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... even if she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from ours ... very different; she had powers at her finger, wishes and command that could be used for good or evil that can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most things we see, they know, their own, or even desires ... can be used for good or bad, and as we choose to define it, it defines the person we are in. <br /> <br /> He traveled to the globe and other realms with these constant and indifferent ideas in the mind ... to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She always learns how to improve her skills for the benefit of all; she made mistakes as she lived through various growth trips, as her aunts and Salem (the underestimated but imperfect hero) have done well to prove that even through mistakes you can still be noble, talented, and wonderful. She also demonstrated many acts of altruism, learning and love as she went on the road. If this is not enough reason for 10 stars in this world of torn war, where people are so hostile to one another, not knowing how the differences are the spice of life, rather than a reason to kill ... then I do not know what It is . This show was definitely a trip to a better world as well as a source of inspiration to be better for us and for a gift that is meant to fly a smile in our chops ... I have heard from a doctor before everything mentioned above leads to a healthy "hart" ... and is not what we all need? :)
