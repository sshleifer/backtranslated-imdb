... in our household. Like anyone else who commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4) and I (10) would watch this movie again and again. We all liked Star Wars, but we've always been back to it because of the great songs and adventure. We all loved Camel and we sang at the top of his lungs with him during his song. There are some slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his yard) and we are generally bored after the Knight's song ("The Reason for Me {The Effect of Sound" is Because I Love You "), but it has us enjoyed the trip to save Babbette and the end and were a bit scared of Koo-Koo's image floating over there, dominating the entire horizon, maniacally laughing at the end, still singing "Hooray for me! Babbette de gay Paris! "Around my friends (I am now 33) who look at me as if I had lost my mind, though, when I sing, I am 10 years old and remembered the wonderful year of the Star Wars.
