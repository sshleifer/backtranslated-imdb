Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series, about which people have heard at least - has basically the same principles as the second and fourth and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still great - a Wellington fire duke and a dr. John Johnson (writer of the first English dictionary) make this series a consideration. In this series there is still a lot of hilarias to be delivered in this series and takes humor to a lesser known epoch - in accurate and pleasant historical episodes. Blackadder's third exit is not the most well-known and best known of the band, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a stupid prince's butler is fun and actually done, and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very good! 9/10
