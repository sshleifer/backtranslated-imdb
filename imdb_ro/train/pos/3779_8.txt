I received the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw him in a store. This was (I think) as amusing as the first story, but a much worse story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they had to play death. The funny thing was that they played him in silly games as a clue. The only thing I would change is Station and Death being in the band, but other than that it was great.
