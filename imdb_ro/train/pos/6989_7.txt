This movie was featured in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not think of that wonderful television series. I think it was a surprisingly good surprise for the town for 40 years, with surprisingly good sound and a picture for a horror film of 67 years. In fact, I enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife, who needed fluid from the brides of young brides, an old hunt, and the two bizarre sons, a giant idiot, the other comic dick (Angelo Rossitto from Freaks of the 1932s). I also enjoyed the female female reporter, which is a kind of stereotype but still fun to look at. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is the plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I do not want to ruin this movie, so go out and rent it, or, better, buy it for a few bucks.
