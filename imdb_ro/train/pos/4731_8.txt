This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to play stoic as Jet Li can. Action is rapid fire, and special effects are amplified for intensity purposes. Consequently, the Americans may be a little in detention. A small suspension of unbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I think it is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and I look forward to making masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) that make it on the American market. A wonderful mix of blows and physical conflicts will satisfy most of the action film enthusiasts.
