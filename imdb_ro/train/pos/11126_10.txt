The soprano is undoubtedly the greatest show in the history of dramatic television. It's hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing, or top-notch performance. <br /> <br /> It produces fresh and iconic characters and a high level of constant quality. Focusing around the life of a Tony Soprano, a man living in two families. One is the conventional wife and children's nuclear family, and the other is a giant group of New Jersey Mafia, of which he is the head of both. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also nice guy. Gandolfini has to praise Gandolfini for having made an aggressive and terrifying aggressive woman, a leading man truly identifiable and perfect. Contemporary American Drama has never had an appealing and symbolic figure like Tony. The hundreds of castings never have a full performance and such remarkable characters as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick to your memory forever. The true genius of this story, however, is the courageous and revolutionary creator and writer on a conventional dramatic series. Twenty minutes of dream sequences, a powerful and original use of metaphorical symbolism and images, and truly shocking violent scenes. However, this style is met by truly touching on themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never gets cold or harmless. With the now competitive and often poor TV, the Sopranists stand on top of the rest, being the most original and complete drama of America. Forget the redone family. This is the redirected television.
