In general, it was a good film with an ideal ending; the act was spectacular and the characters did not separate from their people. I liked the plot more, although you knew what was going to happen, it still gave the element of surprise through the whole movie. However, it seems to me that by the end it could have been a bit longer (perhaps I extended) - for me it seemed to me a little hurried; as if the writer tries to remove linen from the lines before the rain falls. For example ... What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? As far as we know he died in the hospital. Perhaps it was he who prepared everything ?! Who knows! Maybe it will be a sequel? May be? If it is. I can not wait to see him.
