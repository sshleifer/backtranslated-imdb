This is an extraordinary movie that constantly disturbs you. Looks like he's headed for a number of points, and then something stunning that really scares will happen. It would give too much to say much more, but to stay with this movie and you will be rewarded for a long time. William Haines is absolutely delightful - it's definitely a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The homosexual subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford's cold). Both actors subtly interpret subtle texts with emotional depth, so there are moments that move very much. And I never thought I could get involved in a football game like I did in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also excellent is the son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it is not a homosexual film). Wonderfully classic silent - a great example of 20-year-old cinemas.
