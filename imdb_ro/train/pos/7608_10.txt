I looked at the first serious series, but I wondered if I would come back again after a long break from her. However, I directed it in Series 2 episode 1 and I was hooked up again. This is really excellent; things like mission: impossible in the 1960s. Characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on, changes as they adapt - easier than others - to their new environment, but they remain intelligent with a strict character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone you would not have thought you could be bad when something really smashed. I hope there will be many years of "Lost" to look forward to - and I do not mind too much if I never get answers to all the mysteries!
