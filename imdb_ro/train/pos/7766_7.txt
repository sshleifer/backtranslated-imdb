After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone was finally goodbye to her sister / wife and demonstrated the ability to play mantras with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same type of trampolos - and for her efforts to play in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The film is not in line with Oscar standards, but it's a pretty strong melody under the hands of Douglas Sirk. There's an almost noir glance at the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the fireworks in a story that has ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as headliners. <br /> <br /> Domestic confrontation between wealthy, oil-rich family is the focus of drama, with strong emphasis on stacked players, Stack and Malone. They both took advantage of this opportunity with both hands and Stack should have been awarded for his sterling service because the weak, alcoholic brother led to despair on his own wild grounds. an impressive work to do, but it does with the usual talent and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their roles more sympathetic with a calm authority and understanding. The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case in a Sirk film) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking about the film as a Night of Technicolor film in the sense of LEARNING THE NEED. It's worth watching some exciting shows from across the cast.
