There are only 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. That's on television, silver screen or even in real life. As a writer, it's so good it's almost demoralizing! As a viewer it's so fun to bother me that the episodes are over two weeks instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negative are actually positive. I'm a modern guy who has pretended to be in TV drama. Compared to movies, television drama always seemed data, quite tainted and, of course, boring! "Five Days" really brought TV drama to the 21st century, so at least for me, the mind is changing. Go look at her.
