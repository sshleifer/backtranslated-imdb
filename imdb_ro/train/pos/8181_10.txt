Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a swimming pool. Although he discovers that his wife is doing with the companion swimming pool - he realizes that behind all the clean things there is degradation. He begins to torture his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a disturbing dentist - he is completely credible. There is a surprising gore, but the scenes of dental torture are pretty ugly and grotesque. It's highly recommended "Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
