What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "Sopranos" have literally redefined television as we know it. She violated all the rules and set new standards for the excellence of television. Everything is flawless, writing, directing, and for me, above all, the act. Watching this show, you will discover that these characters are NOT real. What makes you think there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not see the show because it's violent, it's not about violence, it's about business, family and many deeper things that depend on what you see, as a fan sees. For me, I do not like when people refer to the show, a mafia show. For me, it's a family show. A family that, by generations, happens to be apart from the crowd. Generally, this is a masterpiece of a show. That should be television. Right here. Complex characters from stunning actors, wonderful story lines from brilliant writing and what do we get when mixing these ingredients together? A performance that defines excellence and dares to be different.
