An exciting movie. The usual actress of John Thaw, who has recently passed. A man who has always been so insignificant. He was one of the top 10 actors in England, definitely of my time. It can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the television series "Sweeney" since 1970 and as a lawyer in QC Kavanah. I have to see for the whole family and a wonderful DVD for my collection. Filming will bring a few memories to people who remember the war in the UK and certainly those who were evicted from London to get rid of the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and William were very well acting and true in Michelle Magorian's book.
