My Take: Use the family's parcel with fine performances and some authentic moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is framed in a plot for the assassination of the United States President, the first traitor in the United States Secret Service. As the agents of the secret service watch, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know the innocent, and the real guy is right around the corner, but I was still having fun with SENTINEL. At this time when the thrillers are reduced to being too absurd and too abundant in action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good ling-back for all those thrillers of political crime. The family plot is exalted by thrilling sequences and wonderful performances. Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is long-term service agent, Pete Garrison, who is framed as part of a plot to assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are following Harrison as he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and traitor of the Secret Service. This leads to a lot of tracking scenarios that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never unbelievable. The script also features a subplot involving Garrison having an adventure with Prima Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, it was not unnecessary for most subplots to be on these types of movies. The director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who manages to make the film look good. Although many have criticized it as "it should have been a TV movie," I do not have to agree. I agree, this film is not perfect, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigue, such as IN THE LINE OF FIRE or a TV 24 series episode (which looks very much like this film in terms of style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film is plotting in serious heights and does not give up even its smaller details. The performances are extraordinary (with a top-notch, with the obligation to be, even with the script by numbers. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it assigns *** 1/2, not perfect , but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
