This is the fascinating, tragic story. Pretty good and, for the most part, quite accurate, considering it to be a TV movie rather than a documentary. They have created some fictitious characters and have combined several real people into one character, but otherwise this is a story of a very tragic and dark story. The final moments of the film, describing mass murder / killing, are almost directly taken from an audio recording by Jim Jones. This record was made during the last 44 minutes of the existence of the People's Temple. It is available in several places on the internet. This part of the film is almost on the spot in this regard. To summarize, a documentary is not. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the People's Temple story.
