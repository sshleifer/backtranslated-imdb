Stephen King's best film alongside IT, though it's more fun than frightening. <br /> <br /> It has everything: <br /> <br /> - a great distribution with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a cameo fun from King himself; <br /> <br /> - well forgotten by horror in a funny story; - intense use of music; in particular "Sleepwalk" from Santo & Johnny; similar characters in a typical d√©cor of the king: the middle of nowhere in the village; <br /> <br /> - a lot of humor. You can not really scare here because it's too fun and above the top. <br /> <br /> - But very nice makeup effects like I do not! <br /> <br /> Rating A 4.5: I do not have much. When was the last time a horror film was as fun as this?
