The call to old movies like this is that you will see a real life-moving picture over 100 years ago. There are a lot of people leaving a factory, all dead so far, and none of them, even remotely, aware of the extent of the invention they are making before. I was shocked to read a reviewer who called this film boring as today's home videos and at least one else erroneously identified it as the first ever movie (it was the first movie made at 16 frames per second, then normally-46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see is that a lot of people are pulling out of a building and going ahead of the cinema on their way home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons, not Last but not least, it was the first film made by the Lumi√©re brothers, who probably had a stronger impact on cinema development than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
