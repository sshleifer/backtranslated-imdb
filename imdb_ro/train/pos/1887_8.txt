Arthur is a middle-aged rich boy who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and tells what's in his mind. He likes to boast of his riches and knows he's a lost madman. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur has to marry a high-class girl to inherit great fortune, but falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (looks very strange). It's a funny movie. I watched this movie because a very famous Indian film "Sharabee" is based on the character of Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is certainly inspired by "Arthur," I think there are two different films. Arthur is just fun. Very strange at times. There are so many fantastic lines in the movie. It's not a laugh, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©'s father and he continues to talk about "los". Duddley Moore has some comic timers. He is very good with words and body language. I liked the scene where she was talking to a couple sitting in the hotel about a small country and still talking to her husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud earned an Oscar for this film. I do not know that actor. I do not think he did a great job, but maybe if I looked more at his work, I could agree in the future. The film has some flat patches, but not very long. looking forward to pursuing the continuation.
