Today there are very few artists who can keep me captivated throughout the film just by their presence. One of these few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career to create characters who are upset in attitude, but very vulnerable to the heart. It has roles that most other interpreters would treat melodramatically and add a deeply emotionally intense intensity that draws attention to anything else on the screen. Her skills are well-featured in High Tide, a film that fits her second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis the first major success with "My Bright Career." In this film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to do it in the world despite the suffocating she felt from her community and her growth. In High Tide, however, the character of Davis, Lillie, is almost opposed: she gave up any hope for her future when she was young, and after she had given birth to a child, she departed from her responsibilities and life without direction or meaning. When she finally meets her daughter later, the thought of taking care of her child is confident; she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still earn her respect? Gillian Armstrong's films usually refer to stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own habits and personal addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda," for example, were about a man and a woman who desperately need each other's love, but they have always been blinded by their desire to make chances, represented by their gambling addiction. Here we are immersed in the family of a family torn apart by Mother's incapacity to engage in a determined life and her struggles to redeem, despite being fully convinced that it is too late to change for the better. This is not only a movie with great performance in its center, but also a rare achievement: a totally convincing story of redemption.
