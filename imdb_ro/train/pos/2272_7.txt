Nick Nolte offers excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark story. Notle interprets Howard W. Campbell, a double agent working in propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, it lives anonymously until the competing factions want to dig their past. As with many of Vonnegut's works, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - self-confident and confident as young Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
