I liked this movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historical point of view. I like Romy Schneider's movies. This rocks, not as big as Sissi, but still stones! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Well, this is initially a German film, not a French one. So yes. Secondly, there was a plot, maybe you do not know your history. Oh and her mother played the role of her governor, not her teacher. And the story was not really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe u missed that detail. But anyway ... give the story of this movie is wonderful, I like the historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I like all the historical things. Like the guy trying to manipulate her mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband and showed him the "waltz of the new type of dance." When the waltz was new, it was considered scandalous, because the couples danced so close. And her governor was like my god! And also clothes, I like my clothes. The styles are great, the loops are great. And, of course, Romy always looks very cute.
