It was a change of life, it was really! Man In The Moon is an impressive track record. The act was fabulous, the story line was wonderful and it was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career. see how anyone can love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever, even if it was close to him, but it was very fun to watch and even have a great laugh at one of the jokes and many other little laughs. Of course, there were also some crying hearts in moments, too, but this movie was bright, and it lit your day, though you have to be depressed by the story from time to time. I do not think this movie has won at least one prize and I also can not believe it was seen by so few people on this site. See this movie if you did not do it for that is definitely touching.
