this is the best comedy I've ever seen! but not all can understand this must be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) the best movie I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors who play very well but the action of Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is, in my opinion, the one better acting in supporting the role of the history of the films :)) in this film playing many Georgian stars like the xvichia ipolichi, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... they are all Stars in Georgian cinema :) plus this movie is played by the great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and, of course, the director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommended this film to everyone, but remember that you need to know the good Russian language to watch this movie
