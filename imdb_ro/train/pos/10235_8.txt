An unusual movie from Ringo Lam and one unusually underrated. The kung-fu fantasy blend with a more realistic picture of swords and spears that are driven by corpses is amazing especially in the first ten minutes. A riding rider melts in two, and his waist and legs hold his horse. Several horses were melting. It's very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and Shaolin's brothers are captured by a mad general madman and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple, which seems to be more a torture room, then a temple. The general has a resemblance to Kurtz in the Revelation Now, as he overthrowed philosophy and made scary human blood paintings. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well made and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from that moment. Sometimes the movie turns into an absurdity or the effects are stunning, but it's never bad enough to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find it, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies in the early nineties. Remember that it is not child friendly.
