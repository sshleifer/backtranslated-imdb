Coming into watching this movie, I was a little skeptical because fantastic movies are not always a cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. I did not really know that I was on a movie trip. Everything in the movie, from plot to dialogue to effects was very close to perfection. Claire Danes shines like the star in the movie. From the beginning to the end, you fall in love with this character more and more. Michelle Pfeiffer is threatened as a wicked witch on capturing the star for youth and eternal beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a loving character that gives the audience the greatest relief of comics while the movie wins the rhythm to the climax. Generally, it was a movie that surprised me and excited me as a fan of the movie. If you're looking for a fun and fun movie that's fun for kids and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
