It does not make sense to get over the story, because enough commentators have done this. Here are some different doubts from one of these "religious walnuts," as a bigot reviewer considers so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) is probably the classic example ever put on the film about how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: looks cute, beats your genes, gives your body free ... and people will fall over themselves to help you with everything you want. > <br /> In this case, it was a job advancement with the ultimate goal of money ..... a lot of it. At least four men in this film offer this, even if they ruin their lives in this process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many of the commentators here seemed to hate - gives another big message: all the money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many "critics" here would prefer to have immoral messages, preferring them to scare the substance. No surprise, I think. In any way, she looks at her, the movie is fun to start with, and Stanwyck has some wonderful lines, especially at the beginning, when he reveals his brutal father and his barrier-free customers. In just over 70 minutes, this movie is moving at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
