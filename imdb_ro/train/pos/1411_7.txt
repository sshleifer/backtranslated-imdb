Greetings again in the dark. Amazing photos highlight this Disney documentary and give a look at some of the hardness of animals living in the wild. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom have given us much of our perspective on wildlife ever since childhood ... back when there is no dedicated National Geographic or Animal Planet channel. What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Looking at the elephants for days, almost delusional because of the lack of water, is so painful. But their night fight against lions is thrilling. Some underwater photos are blown away. Mummies and cocks are beautiful and looking at the attack on the big white shark, his booty is as cool as the "jaws". The most amazing landscape for me was the impressive views of the Himalayas. I've never seen any details about the immense range. I do not think most children today will be too excited about it, but it is certainly one of the most beautiful documentary documentaries I have ever seen.
