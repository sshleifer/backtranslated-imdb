Even in the 21st century, the baby carrier is dangerous: women have spontaneous abortions and premature birth. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme "Life begins": a look at the "difficult cases" section of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the role of leader, a woman brought here from prison (what offense she did not have to do with the plot) to give birth; she is in conflict with the fact that she will have to give her child after birth. She is in a room with several other women who share their joys and pain with each other. Although Loretta Young is the leader, the remarkable performance, as usual, is set by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, showing plenty of supporting roles, and sometimes taking the lead in B films (Farrell performed Torchy Blane in several Torchy B series). , Farrell plays a waiting mother who does not want her children, because they will just be in the way. She does her best to prevent nurses, including the introduction of liquids into the salon (of course during the ban days) and drinking like a fish - it seems they have never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s. Interestingly, unlike most of the early 1930s, not women whimper idiots who stop in the way of heroic men - that situation is reversed, dads waiting to tremble jelly pits. (Watch veteran actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant parents.) "Life Begins," being an early talk, treats the subject with a fair melody to be sure, but it's a pretty charming movie. Turner Classic shows this, though rarely; I only saw her in a few days when I honored Loretta Young. But we highly recommend you to see when it shows up.
