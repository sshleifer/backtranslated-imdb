This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. Moreover, virtually all serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great movies include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki Delivery Service". Spirited Away is pretty good, but a bit too creepy for the typical family fare - better for teens and adults. The only thing that puts "Laputa: The Castle in Heaven," besides Miyazaki's other movies, is that it's a lot more of a tension-filled adventure. Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well made, and the story is really exciting and convincing. Most Japanese anime are imaginative but certainly dark, cynical or violent; and animation itself is often offensive, stylized and juvenile. None of these problems create the Castle in the sky. She has the imagination to burn, and the characters are well-drawn, if the little exaggerated versions of the real people. (None of these trenches carrying pictures) There are many adventures, but not blood and gore. Animation is a smooth, detailed and cinematic alliance - not a lot of flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. The voice acting in English is the first, especially the two stars, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is excellent. Use the studio sound if you have it. One aspect that I especially enjoyed is the fact that much of the back story is left unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited and abandoned. Why? We will never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we must accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so completely accomplished. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully accomplished than most minor characters, which are mostly unidimensional characters (eg General gruff, bad sidekick, spider miner etc.) Highly recommended for people between the ages of 6 and 60!
