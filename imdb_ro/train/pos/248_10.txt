"Ned Kelly" is an awesome Australian movie honoring a true Australian hero. We are taken to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne and other members of the Kelly Gang, because the film explains and can justify Ned's actions. There is an exceptional gift that gives all the star shows, which brings life to the movie. (Good job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing very well as a quiet, loyal lady. I was stifled at this moment. For a moment I almost thought the Gang would win the battle of Glenrowan, unfortunately it was not. Some aspects of the film are fictitious, and as a fan of Ned Kelly, an avid (and supportive) fan, he was a little disappointed with this. Perhaps the film could have been longer to cover Kelly Gang / Ned's life - I did not feel enough was covered. Regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving movie, all sorts of emotions. (And, hey, I would have assumed that this movie would be better to look, rather than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
