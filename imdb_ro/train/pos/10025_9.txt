This must be a twist of two genres ever seen. The giant genre of monster movie life-like mummies. This unique blend makes for a unique and convincing story. The towers are remarkable, including TOM BOSLEY, who, to my knowledge, has never been in a horror film. The effects are impressive, and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cold one. One complaint, I just want to see more about the huge mummy, but other than that they think they did a great job. Dialogue, characters and story were perfect. The act was wonderful. This must be the best movie to get out of the SF channel. You heard me, the best movie to get out of the SF channel. I give him 9 out of 10 FALES.
