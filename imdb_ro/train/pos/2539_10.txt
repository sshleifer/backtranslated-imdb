For real-world filmmakers, this film is a necessity, because it works as a perfect allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science is related to the capture and design of light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do harm or it can be used to do good. On the one hand, she blinds her mother, and on the other she is accustomed to healing the blindness ("I see!", A young girl calls on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the unexpected power of this light, we actually see a ghostly glow on his hands and face as a poorly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are following is a projection, an entity seen on the movie (visible, like in a cinema, when the lights are out). There is a wonderful passage close to the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as being informed that everything that is happening is captured in the light that has rotated in space for millions of years since the light from Andromeda was emitted from that The galaxy at a time when the earth was still melted rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed with old cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblem in the sculptural figures of the explosion of the local Karloff cathedral with its projector / ray gun. One should wonder if this movie should have looked at what happened in Germany at the time, and especially when Riefenstall used the film a year before to promote a a regime that would certainly go forward to do a lot of evil: The triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Mom (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more movies have made you stand up in the theater and shout, "I see!"
