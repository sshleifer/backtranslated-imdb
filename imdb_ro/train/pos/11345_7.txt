That's why I still have nightmares. This horrible (musical) movie was considered child-friendly in the 1970s. A boy is on a magical journey to an island. Mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, would be a dragon, look more like a conjunctivitis salve for me, and a flute of magic is targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered "a bit of good" at the time) . Flute is recovered from an "interesting" witchcraft convention with witches who have an old gay time. The boy dresses in dear, then as a "fairy" to recover the flute. Not suitable for children.
