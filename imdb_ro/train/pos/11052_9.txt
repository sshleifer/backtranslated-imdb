When I was six, I found out about a series called "Los Campeones," and even if I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to persuade my parents to let me watch "The Champions" and "The Avengers " once a week . I think it was the golden age of the English series ... (I already have a complete "The Prisoner" cycle!) But it lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch," or this is "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before how much I want the "Champions" to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I also expect "Dr. Who" a set of, uhm, maybe 300 DVDs Please, I could not spend more for this, 8), "People of Tomorrow," and a few other "low budget", but great stories are available in my access areas. speak and understand English, but not all my relatives, including my parents, have presented me in these wonderful stories ... I hope someday one might feel the attraction of these series and then sell them so as I first saw them .. Dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format I saw them. Keep in mind that zone 1 or 4 is OK with my TV!
