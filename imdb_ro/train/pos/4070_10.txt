I know Anime. I have been in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z really was. And just to know I'm not boasting at me, let me say this: out of all the animations I've seen, the Castle in heaven is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really do not agree. Most people know only this movie because it is an Acedmy Award; this is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who have ever seen Spirited Away and I agree that the last two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I never thought that something can be compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw the Castle in the sky. I still think the precedent is the best of the two, but the Castle in Heaven is easily similar to him; in many respects, the Castle has major elements that Mononoke lacked. In any case, if you only saw Spirited Away and you think this is Miyazaki's best movie, be prepared to turn your ground over.
