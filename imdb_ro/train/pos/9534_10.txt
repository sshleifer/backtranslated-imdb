Action This movie is a very well acting movie. I will say that performances are slightly weak sometimes; but for the most part the act is very good. The only actor that broke out with his show was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed unsaid in moments along the film, but he was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography That made the film a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you interrupt, you will see the delicate work of this man. He arranges each shot so that nothing is lost. When the camera is still there, there is a good postcard on the screen. When the camera moves, each shot is planned to be undervalued. But it does not stop there. It's the choice of colors and the contrast between the light and dark settings is a work of art. The way the set lights up is one of the most amazing lighting works I've ever seen. His work on this film did what it is. This movie is at the top of the LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say that this movie is a 1930s movie, but I think they missed the point of the movie. It's a love story about a man who strikes in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It's a brilliant story that takes place in a beautiful relationship between two people who have nothing but one another. The screen is worthy of an Oscar. Thomas Newman music performs a sad but hopeful hope to intensify this sad but hopeful tale. Music is one of the most beautiful and beautiful scores I've ever made. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performance he receives from his actors is a rarity in the world of today's film. I'll be looking for the next Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 one of the most beautiful and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
