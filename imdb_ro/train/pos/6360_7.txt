I just read the lead commentary for this movie, which is on the first page with the results of the vote and was broadcast. <br /> <br /> Why some people can not take a movie for what they are supposed to be. This movie should be a light heart, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make kids laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. /> <br /> I laughed from this movie, I thought Carey had a great performance and the whole movie (if it was chased at Christmas) really gives you a joy of festivity <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For those who review the movie, they stop trying to sound like movie students and beat every movie because it's not the Taxi Driver or the Nose and it's taking movies for what should be entertainment!
