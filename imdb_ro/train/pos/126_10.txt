Zentropa is the most original film I've seen in recent years. If you like the unique thrillers that are influenced by the noir movie, then this is just the right cure for all these Hollywood summer blockbuster films that clog the theaters nowadays. Von Trier's pursuits, such as Breaking the Waves, have become more recognizable, but this is really his best work. It is brilliant without distractor and offers a perfect combination of suspense and dark humor. It's too bad he decided that portable cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who has spoken to him far from the style he is presenting here, but the loss of everyone is that he has come in the direction of his theoretical dogmas.
