On December 28, 1895, in the Grand Café of Paris, the history of the film enters, while Louis Lumière shows his short films, all the photos, to a paid audience. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first film to have been played and I wanted to be there not only to see the movie but also to the public's reactions. the Lumière factory. Apparently, since the image looks like a photo, people thought they would only see a slide show, not something they hoped for. But then the doors open and people sneak out, heading home. First of all a lot of women, then some men and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When they're all out of the closed door again. If this is the first movie or not (some say "L'Arrive d'un train à la Ciotat" was the first Lumière film), this is an impressive piece of early cinema. To be bored with this is almost impossible for several reasons. A simple reason: it only has fifty seconds. But also for those who normally only have special effects movies must be interesting here; you will not see historical things like this every day.
