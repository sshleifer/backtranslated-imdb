It turned out to be a classic production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is stunning, from foot to foot shoes! I liked the relationship between the leaders, not too sentimental, but quite romantic to keep the interest. I also liked the mixture of humor (which can be very easy to mistake, too much / not enough), which meant it was not too dark or too fake. It was a big step toward Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium's other efforts in terms of story and production. They have a great website worth checking out. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
