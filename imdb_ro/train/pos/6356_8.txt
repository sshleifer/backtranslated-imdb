I figured out how Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty good movie. It was not terrible, it was not great, but it was nice to watch. I felt like Jim Carrey became a bit annoying at times. a person of special education, when everything that was supposed to be, was bad and misleading, but it turned out to be a sort of retard. I think the scenery, when it was not inside Grinch's cave, was beautiful and there were some parts I laughed at, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been much better if it had changed Grinch's personality and included several laughter scenes because most humor was not funny. I liked the way to be Grinch for Christmas anyway, but there is nothing to be delighted to see.
