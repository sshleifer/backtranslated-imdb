In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I became an Eddie fan just after I saw Dress to Kill, but I have to say that I think this is his best work. I would say, though, if you have the chance to see it for sure. Merit! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after seeing a stand-up routine a few times, jokes begin to age. But I have to say that I have seen this show many times that I have literally memorized everything (which, yes, I realize it is rather sad) but every joke makes me laugh. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> The dress at Kill will never become old for me. I hold it and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
