This is a wonderful film about loneliness alone. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a little bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is alone, but has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he does not make any effort at all! He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of reaching the couple - his friend, Jose Garcia, as Tisserand, is in the same situation, but at least he makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginity (28 years old and admits that she never did sex). Rouen, where the two software people are traveling in business. They try various nightclubs and places, but all without result. My theory is that they try the wrong places - they go to more or less nightclubs for youth; they should try the guy who has older people, more of their age. <br /> <br /> Harel becomes more and more isolated and makes a little effort from Niro as in the Taxi Driver, urging his friend / colleague to walk and stab a guoke who drew a beautiful girl in the nightclub. It's worth watching.
