Cypher is a movie that deserves to be seen, because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what is happening. Close view of the room is the way the director keeps the illusion plot. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the script of the film. The technology used in the film is not impressive, however, the director uses the props well. <br /> <br /> Character development is deliberately superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to sink into the world of espionage. It depends on the audience to realize its enigmatic character and is the enigma that keeps the audience interested even to the end.
