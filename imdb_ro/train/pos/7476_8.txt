I can really say that I felt the movie in its right essence, where the mind games from the reality of dreams come into the surreal aspect of the future Tom Cruise faces. I did not care much about the way Tom Cruise played, but I have to say he seems to impress at every point of the movie ... not just because of an interesting story, but also because he was shared with the main character . ... mix and then speak her beautiful. However, I must say that this film does not fall under the "weekend average fluctuation" that you choose at random and watch with joy; Has strong feelings and characters so you do not wash it with beer and pop-horn. He certainly needs more than that.
