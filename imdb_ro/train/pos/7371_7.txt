A suspense thriller that has a likeness to Deliverance, as well as decoration and decoration. There are also some very innovative and good music scenes, although the impetuous and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is not appropriate for the situation, although this is not a problem for the mayor. It also asks interesting questions about the correctness of vengeance and the limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
