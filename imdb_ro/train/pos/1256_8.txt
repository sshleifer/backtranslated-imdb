This is a very dramatic and suspenseful film. There are many plots and turns. The story or the director opens the question marks about the death or alleged crimes committed by blacks. This movie is very well directed by Arne Glimcher, and the good sound of James Newton Howard is great. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this, do not rate "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
