This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, a well known dEUS group singer, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or plot. This film shows only 24 hours in a "city" (here in Antwerp) and lets you really watch and enjoy the dialogues, direction, humor (Dario !, osteopath Bruno! Windman, Paul Garcin, ...). There are several memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, dancing party, KISS fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... /> <br /> Clearly, other spectators did not understand what is so beautiful and exciting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no story, etc. But it is the atmosphere that follows you and attracts you into it. If you have not looked yet, listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary like Tom Barman and his dEUS group. And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©". (do not tell anyone)
