When the United States entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to launch propaganda films. The American fight is probably the best part of the batch because she sees Mary Pickford. Pickford plays a young man between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed by war as the enrolled men. When the Pickford sailing ship is submerged by the Germans (I think Lusitania) because they carry the ammunition, Pickford has a wonderful scene while on the rescue boat and yelling at the German commander. Later, of course, she enters both Holt and Hatton when she is detained as a prisoner of war at a chateau. Director Cecil B. DeMille offers a really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt stray through a bulging village. They go through a destroyed church, of which only one wall remains. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As I sit and watch, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in the air. It is a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very simple and non-artistic. Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to look. She has always been a very natural actress who has avoided the history of moving the arms and other actors of the day. She's very beautiful. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is all right. Among the names of the extras include Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. a great but exciting movie to see American propaganda at work.
