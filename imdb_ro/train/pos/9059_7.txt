This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be word-of-speech, you will be very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book several times when I was in elementary school. It's about a new kid in town called Billy. He makes a school bets bet and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in a single day or the winner will win. The actor is fine, probably the worst part of the movie. The child's actors are exaggerated over many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy does not eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job, though. The parcel line is good as a movie, but it's grim as an adaptation of the book. I was able to watch this movie without looking in time ... sometimes. Generally, it was a good family film with some weaknesses. I rated this movie 7/10.
