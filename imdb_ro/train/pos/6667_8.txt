O.K. There are people who should not see this movie. 1) Do not see him if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) You do not like if you offended The Watchmen_. 3) Do not see him if you want a serious superhero movie. The rest, run away, do not walk to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's weird, it's a delightful delight of every clich√© superhero known to man. Occasionally, defeat in junior-high humor does not destroy the noisy fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some more funny parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Good to see Louise Lasser work.) I laughed all the way. Pretty weird, a little weird, but good.
