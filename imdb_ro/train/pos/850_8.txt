MATADOR (2005) *** - Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of the best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin who is facing a middle-aged crisis while on a mission in Mexico where he is married to an American businessman who has kept it still enjoyable (Kinnear at best friend) and finds that there is more life than death. Director Richard Shepard, a new director, makes a solid debut with a black comedy with a sharp eye for visual details and nuanced dialogue and character development, making him gifted to look at this fresh air atmosphere in the Buddy comedy " formula tilting what is expected of his leaders and allowing Brosnan to take his ya-ya with a diabolical zeal. An indie sleeve sleeve hit.
