I'm a fan of TV movies in general and he was one of the best. The overall performance was pretty solid and there were twists and turns that I did not see before each ad. For me it was as if Medium met with the CIS. Someone else believed that in some lights the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they tied in any way? I will definitely watch or rent her if she ever comes to the movie. Dedee was great. You have not seen it in many things, and she has made it very convincing. If you are in mystery TV movies, check it out if you have a chance.
