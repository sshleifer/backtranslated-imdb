I really like this kind of 1930s mystery / police movies, Charlie Chan, and this is no exception. However, something sorry about this movie. A tentative attempt to move from brain motors centered around plotting plotting to a salad bar scorned by comedy relief that is as relieving as painful feet. A typical boy appears from nowhere that resembles a leftist Englishman who interprets the detective, and even other characters seem to be entangled in helping with comedy. The plot may seem strange or an empty excuse for us today, but then, the possibility of archaeological archaeological discoveries was not only real but a common occurrence.
