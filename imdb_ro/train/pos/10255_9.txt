This movie is the first of six movies of Guinee Pig infamous and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, knowing only that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who was captured and tortured in many different ways. A man from the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and includes a video about manga showing torture. The people who capture it test the limits of a man before he dies. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene, and others are not shocking as the girl is perforated 100 times, because you see punches in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I would recommend this to people of 17 years or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
