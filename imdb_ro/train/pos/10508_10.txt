Mario is invited to the Princess Peach Castle for the cake. When Mario gets there, he discovers that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must rescue the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore whatever he wants. He can just walk, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. There are no time limits. There are 16 worlds with a number of stages, and there are some star doors that you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter these gates, you have to go through a scene and fight with Bowser at the end of the stage. To reach certain worlds, you need a number of stars to enter. Enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many hours of play, I do not see how anyone can dislike this game. It's great. This release is the game that assured the players that the N64 would have a good life. Every game with a 3D platform that we know has something to do with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have a N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used, because no one sells this baby for $ 5 at the pawn shop. It's perfect 10.
