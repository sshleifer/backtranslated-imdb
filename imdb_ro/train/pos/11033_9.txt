I do not think I will ever understand hate for Renny Harlin. "Die Hard 2" was great, and gave the world "Cliffhanger", one of the most wonderful action movies ever. That's right, the little punks, "Cliffhanger," and we all know. Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue hunter who "only visits" his old town when asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker, obviously, returned at a convenient time, because the lost people are actually a sophisticated thief team led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they lost a lot of money they stole from the US government, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains they would really like ... Essentially, "Cliffhanger" is another clone "Die hard ". Just the trade within Nakatomi Plaza with the open mountain chains of the Rockies, complete with scenes designed to highlight our hero's deficiencies and keep him dead. Naturally, this set is completely cleaned to pieces pretty quickly because Stallone's character avoids a lot of bullets quite easily and strikes face-to-face with more rock faces without obvious side effects. After all, is it not about action movies? Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action movies around. A show of great scenes and stunts. One of the earliest stunts is one of the best stunts I have ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie has no better effect than the beginning, it keeps its wonderful action. John Lithgow's bastard is fun and a bad guy. It is possible that one of the best lead evildoers ever. "Cliffhanger" is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
