I like this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week! The first episode was so exciting and frightening ... so was the 2nd part of the pilot ... I will definitely continue to find this show! This is the real Survivor! I looked at some of the other comments and I see that already after just one or two episodes, the monsters here are already crying wolf ... Sorry if there is another reality show, kiddies! It was once a moment they existed ... now it supports you! Real TV shows! And this is actually good, unlike most of today's sitcoms, or the carbon copy of a Law & Order series or NYPD Blue or CSI, which he reveals ... Look at you to get your own opinion, take one out of here!
