If you read the books, then forget the characters that Tolkien built in their head. Representation of hobbies, dwarves, etc. had a "Disney" treatment. The dark riders are excellent and, as I have always imagined from books. Cinematically, this is an excellent movie, mixing animations and animations live to produce stunning effects for the year. I just want him (Bakshi) to have received the money to complete his epic. It is worth having the video as it will be worth a little after the Lord of the Rings of 2001!
