I admit that I'm addicted to vampires: I've seen so many vampire movies that we've lost, and that's definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with John Carpenter's original vampires and when I discovered it was a sequel, I went straight and bought it. This film does not exactly follow the same rules as the first one, and it's not so dark, but it's pretty close, and I felt like building the original. Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was pleasant and yet it was quite difficult for the spectator to believe that he could actually be able to survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite songs was immediately after meeting Zoey and wandering in the evening bath to see if it was more than it seems. His comments are beautifully irreversible and yet extremely practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene as they unfold. The other cast members were also well-chosen and knitted nicely to produce a fun and original film. It's not just a remixing of the first movie and it has grown in a way similar to how Fright Night II grew up in Fright Night. There are different elements that make it a fresh movie with a similar theme. If you like vampire movies, I'd recommend this movie. If you prefer less bloody movies, choose something else.
