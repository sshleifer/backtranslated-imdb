One of my favorite movies, anytime. Just beautiful, full of human emotion, intelligence, humor, intelligence. The story grows, just like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. Distribution is also fantastic ..... a great selection of the best British talent around. I loved everyone for every different element in the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to form such a story - everything about this movie works. <br /> <br /> I like it
