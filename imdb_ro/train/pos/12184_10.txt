In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of evil), Orson Welles gave him an exuberant man. "The Lady from Shanghai" is the only time I see him playing the role of the victim. The guilty role he gave Rita Hayworth, I think he is because he was in love with her. Therefore, it is an interesting movie. But I also have the excellent story. Direction is genius, as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly brilliant: the aquarium and the final with the mirrors. This movie is brilliant (10/10).
