I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley's fans will not be disappointed! And if you are not familiar with this director's work ... it does not matter. This movie can definitely be alone. I have to go to the second screen ... it was amazing to have to see it again - and quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. The dialogue is very clever, and Parker Posey's performance is remarkable as she plays the lead role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the last feature of the world and the characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000). From the visual point of view, the most important stylistic feature uses the usual use of the angled (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's past work that appears in various shorts available in Possible films: short works of the collection Hal Hartley 1994-2004, and The Girl by Monday (2005). I saw this movie most aptly on September 11th. Texturatively, Fay Grim's adventure in this story is directed against the world changed after September 11, 2001. Without entering the major spoilers, I see this work and the world of stories as a brave political and original portrayal of geopolitics, which is rare, if ever, in the forefront of the fictional post-911 cinema so far (cf., Syrianna: from the note - Mark Cuban Exec, Prod in both films ... most interesting, let me say the least). Ultimately, for those closely attached to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this movie is hilarious self-conscious and self-referential. That being said, Fay Grimm's character starts in the movie, exactly where he was when Henry Fool ended, but by the end of the movie ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and expanded completely throughout the narrative. What can be in the store for the future of the Fay family and the Fool family ...? I can not wait for the third part in this story!
