I am surprised to see even one journalist criticizing this old film. We usually do not get good opera movies, and here is a true big-motion show. Obviously, the pictures are not wonderful. It's dated. But as a work can not be condemned; and I'm an opera boy. I can not detect even a lip sync; if we do not know it was Tebaldi in the audio nothing will convince me it is not Sophia Loren. DO ALL WITH FLEX! Her dark makeup is fine; and she has brought her role in superb life! The cast is wonderful, just like the amazing ballet band. Most actors are excellent; Loren really great. His Amneris rival is also wonderful. Anyone who did not care about this job in 1953 is shameful. Verdi would have enjoyed this! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I like this old movie!
