An old collection of stories is a challenge for the production team, how this classic character can be brought to light and makes it interesting enough to capture a new auditor while mixing memories from his former audience. In my opinion, their mission has been accomplished. They have to see for young children, adolescents, teenagers and their parents. OK, there are some frightening moments that are solved in short order, but parents with young children should stay tight, the film is heading for better things. I'm going to go with those good commentators who emphasize that Emma Roberts gives us a positive model for young women, and not for them. Nancy balances her femininity with her career skills. Lots of love here, laugh, do not take too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one you can figure out as an extra bonus and love characters.) Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in the opinion my.
