This movie has one of the most beautiful plots I've ever seen. For me, that's what makes it wonderful! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked awesome together "comic". I wish Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, had more involvement. She showed she could make comedy in the original series, but she was largely wasted in this film. Also, this film sees the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think it might have been better off.
