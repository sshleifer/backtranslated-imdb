I liked this movie! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan and I've always been impressed with all his work. From his most dramatic roles, such as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Private Salvation Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. For his hilarious roles, such as a Own League, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, Killers Lady, Big &, of course, Toy Story. But in this film, Hanks is not the only great actor to shine on the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an elderly star, who shows a great promise to Hollywood stars as Hanks' son, and offers only tremendous performance. He is certainly someone who takes care of his career, I think he will do wonderful things. Paul Newman as always delivers brilliant screen performance. He is truly a legend. We can not forget the people who did not have such big roles in the film, but they have helped to do this wonderful. Jennifer Jason Leigh, beautiful and very talented, who will perform in Bastard Out of Carolina and a single white woman I will never forget, bring her grace on screen as Hank's wife in the movie and do a great job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the movie. He does such a wonderful job with such a small role and, like his roles in Lemony Snickets and Sweet November and dreamed of Africa, he offers great performance.
