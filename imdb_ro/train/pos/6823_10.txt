I spent last week watching John Cassavetes - starting with "a woman under influence" and ending in the "opening night". I am completely and distant, especially through these two films. from the first minute to the last "opening night", I was completely and completely absorbed. I felt it only a few times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted from about two-thirds until, until the credits appeared. everything about this movie, from the way it was shot, Gena Rowlands' unbelievable spectacle, credit, opening, music, plot, sense of depth, rhythm, sensitivity, originality, characters, ability of little moments ... for me, it's really sublime. I could not agree more with the previous comment about taking her to a vain island, because the depth of this movie is something to look at. if you are not unlucky enough to have a fire in the house, I guarantee that instead of making a final attempt to save money under the bed, you will save the copy of this movie.
