Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best photographs ever since ... much ... long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but everywhere a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene inside is where Jim is tangling the anchor man's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
