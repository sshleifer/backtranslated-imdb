Being half-Portuguese does not make me half blind (no half of prejudice) when I'm talking about Portuguese films. Not that I will do it very often anyway. But this movie was such a hurry of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was largely accurate in terms of going / gone history - but it did not hit the adventure beyond the usual Portuguese film: things like the use of real places in the middle of crowded Lisbon traffic the recruitment of a real crowd stands for the real crowd nearly 30 years ago. And God did it well! OK, to summarize: very emotional if you lived through it, but you will notice minor improvements that could have been made, as well as plotting needs that were. If you look at it at random, you are at a good historical rhythm, only in very recent history and a little more thoughtful than usual. Even at European standards, yes.
