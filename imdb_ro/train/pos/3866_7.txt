The Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to make a jump on the small screen that was still in its infancy. But the status of studios as a fictional television producer would be short. After this show, they would later intercept the other format for which they were known, the adventure series with "Commando Cody" and other series, but like this, it did not last more than 39 episodes. Also, the Republic was in its last stages as a studio; will end his Hollywood tenure as several stages of the Revue Studio series, such as the "Soldiers of Fortune", the original "Dragnet" and "Kit Carson," before closing the doors in 1959. <br /> < However, "The Stories of the Century" were not so bad with an oat, the business card was stories based on authentic figures from Western history, especially outlaws like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin, The Dalton Bros. such as. Jim Davis, best known for his role as Patriarch Ewing of "Dallas," has made an amicable job in the lead role, as was Matt Clark, a fictitious rail detective who has to fight with them, be veteran characters. Two amazing facts here: incidents would take place in different times, some in the 1880s, some at the beginning of the century, but Clark never ages. And also Matt is lucky to break up with two beautiful female detectives, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle and her replacement, Margaret "Jonesy" Jones, by Kristine Miller. Lone Ranger might just want a lady company. You can spend such time with Tonto for so long.
