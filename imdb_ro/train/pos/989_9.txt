Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We waited for a comedy accompanied by light, but I received a action-packed action movie with comic blows. We both thought this movie would not have happened so well at the box office, because the previews make us think it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse always puts himself in a terrible job. Most of the castings are veterans, not timers, and solid. We both felt that writing and direction were the first rate, and comments were made about buying this movie. If you do not buy a rent for a good time.
