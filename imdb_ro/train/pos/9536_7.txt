The Japanese film, which was filmed and scary in terms of graphics, about beings who took people and transformed them into zombie-like machines that beat and tear each other so that the winner could eat the defeated. In the middle of this thing a pair of lovers become infected. Technically superb horror comedy (?) It is only for those with strong stomachs like blood and parts of the body go flying. Good taste prevents me from describing what's going on here, but it just lets say it's pretty scary. If you like this kind of multi-step stuff over the thin content by all means, see this movie. Normally, I'm not usually one who enjoys movies like this, anything but sick and twisted go to the level. Here I was pretty intrigued that I can suggest to the people I know, who I really like goral movies. It's also a film with enough details to want to see it again because now I know what's going on finally revealed - I want to go back and see what was not caught. There is a rare internal logic in these movies. 7 out of 10 for those who love their blood and limbs cut out, is zero or more precisely a run and hides the alert for everyone else.
