A funny little movie. It's absolutely incredible, incredible, impossible. But it is funny how an introvert masochist can become completely addicted and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl she barely knows, but who has managed to descend into her fantasies. Of course, it is a denunciation of silly transactions that you can access on the Internet. You do not have to believe ten percent of what you have said there, and you will never ever accept to bind your hands in one way or another to someone or something or an organization you do not know personally. Most of their "business" exists in one way or another that will bore you and attack you. But here the chap deserves to be the victim of such gangsters, because it is not just naive, it is absurd of stupidity. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends with the victim of the crooked business with the upper hand and ending playing the same game with the victor and the winner. Some believe it's safe too. Safety in English airports is not exactly as it should be, but I think it is not better elsewhere in the world and even now have all the rules and regulations it is fun to go through their procedures and use them in systematically. Then he takes revenge by losing his luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and you do not expect to get the right compensation. Or even the confiscation of a bottle opening device or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I see that I cut my way through the airplane side with a box opener. Funny, is not it?
