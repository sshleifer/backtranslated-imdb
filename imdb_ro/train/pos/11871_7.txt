Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE presents a picture that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns into stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, becomes a powerful player in the drug world, while he directs the kingdom of crime he has done in Florida. This gangster hit is tough, violent, hard, rough, unpleasant, and must keep track of the word "f-k" rotating most of the time. For almost three hours, and yes it can become repulsive. A strong constitution in your heart keeps you in your chair, applauds the death of a ruthless killer. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of his greatest generation. It manages to bring reality to its character that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone because you let yourself think that you have gone from a disaster. Is she strong enough for you? The crime does not pay much!
