The documentary begins in 1986 in the NYC, where the black and Hispanic queens shoot the balls. Here she dresses as she likes it, gathers her stuff in front of an audience, and is voted. We know many members, and we see how everyone is meeting and supporting each other. Just as a man says to someone else, "You have three shots against you - you are black, gay and dear queen." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only balls. There they can be whoever they want and they are accepted. Then the movie is cut three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but it is not. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and have a lot of fun in their situation. They are aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - as they should. We find that everyone lives in "houses" run by different "mothers" and they all help each other. The feeling of community in this movie is fascinating. When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a great success. He has won the best documentary awards at numerous festivals - but has never been nominated for the Oscar. Their reason was that "black and Hispanic dragons are not the matter of the Academy". Fascinating is not it? Homophobia and racism together. <br /> <br /> Seen today is still a great movie - and a vintage piece. It's just not like that - NY said it did not exist anymore. The balls are still kept, but not in the spirit we see here. Also, love has become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard the houses were gone. It's kind of sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know two died of AIDS, but I have no idea about the others. And what happened at the age of 13 and 15? <br /> <br /> However, it is a documentary of a kind - fascinating, funny and riveted. We have to go all the way! A definitive 10. Where is the DVD ???
