I really liked this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Aquaman (although all she was doing was swimming), my eyes grew. To see the majority of the League's founders who are trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what I expect. That seems to be a bit of a subject, but doing a live action of the Justice League show would certainly make me have a reason to push everything I usually do during the week down the drain just to watch an episode. This is the emotion I received from watching this episode. I would have liked to have done this episode a little longer, like two special hours, because I felt that an hour in the League of Justice was not enough. Now, before I get bored (if I do not already have my shit) I just mean, Smallville is cold again. He even lost touch when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the writers will fall back into that hole. : (How much you enjoy this episode, who knows when another good one will come out.) Grab it again on Thursday, February 22nd, if you missed your first broadcast.
