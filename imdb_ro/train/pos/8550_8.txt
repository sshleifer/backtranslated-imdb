I now love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler, but then the quality dropped. The Band Camp has kept the standard reasonably well with the characters who actually cared for you, but Naked Mile was the same joke and recycled recycling lines (Erik Stifler's sex problem is that of Jim). It had amusing moments like the football match against the stones and the "punishment" of Coozeman, but overall it lacked originality, and "Mile" was just bad and moronic. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough about Mile Naked. I watched the Beta house with fear, believing it could lead the series to a new wave, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is not a real plot, but it is full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sexual jokes are aplenty. Yes, it's about forms and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. The Greek Olympics particularly entertain penultimate and final events, while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. But there are weak points. The Co-Earth is just as irritating as the first, I'm still embroiled in the way he ever had a part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White has made Naked Mile a pain to watch, but in House Beta he takes his performance to a whole new level. First of all, it lacks charisma, a prerequisite for Stifler. You really do not care less about him. The only reason I was disturbed by his relationship was that Ashley might be on the screen! It shines above it like the rest of the camp. Seriously, John White is the last in bad action and has as much charisma as dead fish. <br /> <br /> Saying the movie is having fun and Coozeman's fear that his girl is not even a girl is brilliantly amusing. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is worth hiring, taking some of your colleagues and laughing at the vomit-fest event and venturing your rage at Erik 'loser' Stifler.
