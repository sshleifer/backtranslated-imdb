One of John Ford's best movies, "The Informer," does not contain any marine scenery of the American West. Instead, Ford's intense drama was known for the tracks on the no less serious terrain of British actor Victor McLaglen. The former preffighter, who faced Joe Louis in the ring, offers an Oscar winner of the disappointed IRA soldier, Gypo Nolan, in the worst night of his life. The land is gracefully simple: in 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was thrown out of the IRA because he could not kill a cold blood informant, becomes himself an informant. For 20 pounds, he betrays a friend to "Tans," and for the rest of the night he kisses and gives his money in a quick spasm of alternation, denial, self-pity, and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions . <br /> <br /> It's a remarkable complexity to the character of seemingly simple Gypo, which is the most impressive achievement of the film. In most movies, a Gypo tip was thrown as heavy, had at least two or three lines and would have disappeared quickly so that the hero and the villain could have the showdown. In The Informer, Gypo himself is both a hero and a villain, while the showdown is in its inner turmoil, each of which is explicitly shared with the public. Since Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates, especially the Joseph H. August cinema, did so to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man in war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar, "The Informer" also won his first John Ford, along with winning the best screenplay and best score.
