I remember watching this movie, thinking was so exciting. I really wanted to know what's going on. I was amazed at how much it would suit in a short time of 8 minutes. We start in a school yard. . Two friends discuss the class jump. Kid B tells Kid A: "Let's not go to class today." And Kid A refuses, claiming he could lose something really important. So baby B misses and baby goes to class. When they get there, the teacher tells them that today they will learn the only important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. Everybody gives him a brochure, and when he gets to baby A he ends and tells the boy next to him to divide. The child will not divide, so Kid goes to look for the teacher. When he finally finds it, he receives a shocking revelation about the real meaning of life. I suggest to everyone to follow this short. It will take only 8 minutes from your life, but the message is very important, it could help you for a lifetime.
