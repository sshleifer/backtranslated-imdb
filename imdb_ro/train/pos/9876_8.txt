Lily Mars' presentation is a really nice little film featuring Judy Garland's comedy skills, along with his standard singing moments. The plot is made up of Lily Mars tagged by producer John Thornway for a long break. I think the comedy is light and nothing hard here. I really love this movie for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
