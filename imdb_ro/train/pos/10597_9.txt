I appreciate photos that try something different. Many movies seem to be rehearsing old ideas, so this is the most important reason I recommend the more the passport to Pimlico. The film is set immediately after the Second World War, and post-war gaps and judgments seem to drive London's "bartenders." The film focuses on a small London neighborhood called Pimlico. And they get sick of not being able to buy what they want, but I can not see any way out of it. That until accidentally happens on a hidden treasure and a charter that officially called this neighborhood a sovereign nation hundreds of years ago! With this document, they report that they can overcome all reasoning and coupons and live their lives as they wish, because it turns out they really are NOT British subjects! If the movie goes from there and the way the crisis is finally resolved is something you have to see for yourself. Let the bright minds of Ealing studios come with this gem!
