My first exposure to Whale Music was the Rheostatics album of the same name I bought around 1993. I read the line notes and the band said that the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian Paul Quarrington's book. I took the book a few months later and devoured it! An amazing reading! I read the book again, every time I found something new for Desmond and his desire to complete whale music. I found the film in 1996 on video. I did not have many good experiences with the Canadian movie, but it worked for me. Claire's role might have been different, but overall, Paul Quarrington's vision has been nicely transferred from book to screen. Maury Chaykin offers moving performance as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands. I would strongly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans but also to anyone who ever lost anything or anyone and tried to find their way back into the world.
