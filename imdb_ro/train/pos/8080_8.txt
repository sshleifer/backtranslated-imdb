Well, I just got used to reading the comments about these movies that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better bastard than in some of his most famous films. He was a sweet bastard, a bastard without excuse. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villain is in no shape. I think the director could have done better. But to be honest, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. She is an unhealthy heroine, a veteran veteran who is overclassed for every role he gives him. But I have to say that I appreciated her contribution very much as he played Virendra Sahi's wife. There may be some work to do, but it does everything with total conviction. I'm sure he's been flying over the head of most of the audience. So if you're used to setting yourself up for Bollywood, you will not get much of this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then this can give you a few of what you missed.
