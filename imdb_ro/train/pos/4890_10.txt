Excellent distribution, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can catch anything else written by Plater (or play with these wonderful actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a real sense of jazz, my recommendation is to see the Beiderbecke trilogy whenever you can. "There are three types of jazz - Hot, Cool and" What time does the song start? "
