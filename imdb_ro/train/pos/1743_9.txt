After seeing a lot of Greek films, I feel very suspicious against most of them. But after I watched it, I felt amazed. The movies are great without a great test. You can not claim that the script is so great or the photo is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it's happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The movie is like a stomach blow and I really want things to be not like that. Obviously, he speaks of the Greek people's xenophobia (ignorance) over everything else. The problem of this guy is not that he is a former convict. The problem is he is not one of these people. He is different and does not want him (that's why all the good things he makes him become boomerang for him). It also talks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against the king's hunt, but do not dare to say their point of view. Finally, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of a society that is religious and who attempts to act as God says, but at the same time acts so unfairly on the Emperor. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. Finally, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means you can only understand and belong to this society if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even alone, you are lost (and not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and that it should be a bell for everyone. No comment for the main actor because he was awarded a prize and I think his play was great. Little comment for Hatzisavvas (he plays the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played many roles and I'm sure this role for him was very easy, but he plays so great that you can not deny a big bravo. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
