The cinematic version of Alice Walker, a highly emotional and influential novel from 1983 (mostly written as letters from the central character of Celie God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so. Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave the best mileage performance. Not behind her was Oprah Winfrey like Sofia, the woman full of iron pushed by fate. Others in the cast have written characters that Walker has introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force for change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, Preacher's wife; and Carl Anderson (best known as Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar 1973) as Samuel. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful and sensitive writing, "The Purple Color" while opening the story to involve the spectators of a dramatic length.
