First, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you are dealing with the writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION greatly synthesizes Tolkien's universe with psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture in the 1970s. Yes - animation and background painting is sometimes a bit "rough" in its technical execution, but it is still beautiful and very evocative in terms of offering a " place feel "unique for each scene. Beyond absolute uniqueness in imaging is the absolute special voice - action that is FAR superior to action in new live action movies. And while cell animation can not be the most animated animation, it remarkably captures the expressive gestures of the body and face of the act, never forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. Background paintings range from traditional "fantasy" to absolute abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by narrative and largely contributes to the themes of the film. If you are a person who needs to have ample computer performance in a movie so everything can be viewed for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you like the superior transcendental images and JRR Tolkien then this film is a necessity.
