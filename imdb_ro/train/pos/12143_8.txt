Brilliant film, the next best movie for Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought an original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years, but as good as that. The actress was terrible, and doubling was even worse, but those traits make this movie (and many other Chinese movies in old Chinese style) huge. The choreography is great, and the story is basic. I have never seen the shaolin's 36th room but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Back to 36th Room is played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy and brilliant kung-fu value.
