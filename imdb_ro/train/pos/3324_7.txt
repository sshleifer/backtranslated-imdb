Someone has mastered the difficult task of combining sports with romance. In fact, sport and love go together as oil and water. So to put the two together on the screen ... Well, that means the equivalent of atom division. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I generally do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most sports videos. This movie was a pretty good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I really appreciated the comedy calumny with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) being a fan of Boston Redsox. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the baby's curse that has plagued Redsox for 86 years and they know how strong baseball is a lot of Redsox fans. The Farrely brothers did a wonderful job and they did it for a good comedy. This was a great movie that could appeal to many.
