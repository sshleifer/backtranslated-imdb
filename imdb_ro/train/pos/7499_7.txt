But it's kind of hilarious, at least if you grew Weird Al, as we did. It is a mockumentary about his life and career, starting with superstardom and back to track the origins. It's uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, especially when it goes to Japan. Although he is not so emotionally textured as lost in translation, and he does not find love, however, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melancholy, which is the street life in Tokyo. is not recognized as a cultural insightful commentator that is; maybe a rose with any other name would smell just as sweet. However, this is a funny movie.
