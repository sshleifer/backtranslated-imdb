I came to this late show - I think it was the third and last episode when I first saw it - and was rejected by a social comment that was not seen on American television from "All in the Family ". <br /> <br /> <br /> It was very surprising that CBS would even do this first. Which just means that the last time CBS had a set - if you know what I mean - came back to "Everything in the family" day. The most controversial decision they are about to address today is how much makeup effect Katie Couric is doing. If you want to make a bunch of really crazy people - find out the truth about themselves. And if you want them to want to pull strings, make calls and take a distant artwork, discover their truth by listening to their own words spoken in their mouths. The Aardman people have always been ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. In a way, he suffocated under CBS's "corporate / social / political / censored" radar to get him into the program (maybe "brass" did not see it in the end?). they saw themselves as themselves - well, they can bet on the farm that the message or the messenger will not last long. Now if only "missing episodes" can find the way to Usenet or bittorrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
