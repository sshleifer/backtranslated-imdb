This show is worth watching. He has the best talent I've seen in a very long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I think ABC directors are not used too much because it was not another reality show). However, this show was credible with nice characters and wonderful story lines. I'm probably not in the age group they expect to enjoy the show, as they are forty years old, but many of my friends liked it (from the mid-1940s) and die for the show, quality websites with talented members. I do not think that this show was given enough time to win an audience. I think that, with more time, this show would have done very well. Once again, ABC does not give a truly real show a real chance. With so many shows, chance was given after the chance and it is not worth it! They have to offer real quality chances and time to make a click and to win an audience. I really like the characters and look forward to watching each episode. I watched the episodes in ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Although I think we owe another episode (number 13?). We want to look at what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if you can save this show from extinction. Sure he worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving, and this show is certainly one of them.
