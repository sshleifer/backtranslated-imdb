First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his movies you will see that the characters have those moments when they are the same. His character in this movie is far farther than every now ... and counting. The story begins in the future (not so far) in which a man is sent in the past to find the source of a virus that has crushed most of the world on the face of the earth. The story seems to go to SF, but I think it's closer to a drama due to the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Movies tend to be faster and more lazy at times and grow more towards the end than at first, but as you see this movie, you will be aware of this constant rhythm of the story and the disclosure of non-accelerating facts and do not slow down. It's the same speed that flows smoothly and pretty well. But that does not mean that the end of fatigue will pull your nerves, give it quite well. As for the direction, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by poor targeting, but it has become much better. So if you're ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or an action, you'll miss it. B There should be more movies like this.
