I saw this movie when I was little. And I enjoyed each other. Surely the graphics are a bit cheesy, compared to now, but again in the '70s it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That's how I remember that my Christmases were with my family - magical. Santa was amazing and I could not wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, let's forget this old version of "Santa Claus". Is it a different version than we are used to today, but who says it is a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. Teach children to be good or bad. I do not know how the English version is subtitled, or if there is one English one, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays Feliz Navidad!
