There is something about every "Hammer" movie that I see is that it really takes me into a fantastic new world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of Abyss" is one of those types of movies. Adventures deep into occultism and hypnosis to bring another kind of horror fantasy. On the whole, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
