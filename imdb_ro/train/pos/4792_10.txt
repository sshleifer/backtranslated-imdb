Straight Story is a multi-level exploration of America's beauty and beauty. At a level, a slow walk through the surroundings, is a kind of inhabitants and amber grain, to another level, to become old and to remember what is important (and to actively forget what It is). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said silently. A remarkable movie that will rest easy with me for some time.
