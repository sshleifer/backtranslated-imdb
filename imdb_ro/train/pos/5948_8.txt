Some of the posters seem less carved because it is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but clearly they are not claimed to be any. It would be a long time for you to find a fan of Rodgers and Hart bigger than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly the liver they knew Der Bingle inside and they were making big songs - But Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, Always You, The Day After Forever, etc. - to suit his very personal style and here come with another well-and unjustly neglected ballad - Once And For Always plus a pair of optimistic-lite philosophy in If You Put On Your Finger per month and do not take it. Crying is not to be taken seriously - why else does Merlin make it hard when in most, if not in all the other variants, he is more of a friend / mentor of Arthur - so if you start wondering why Mr. Lancelot who was sold to historians as a symbol of the ark and the metamorphosis of fairness in a school bully, you will not get much fun from what is basically a fun movie. In balance, do what he intends to do, have fun, so much luck.
