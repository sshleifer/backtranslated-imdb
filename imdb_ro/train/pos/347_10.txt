Valentine is now one of my favorite movies. Scenes of death are developed and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton made a great female story (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I know ..."). David Boreanaz, which is the main reason I saw this movie, played a rather small role but played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. It was horrible in this. The only scene I enjoy seeing her was * SPOILER * her death scene. On the whole, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before tracking "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
