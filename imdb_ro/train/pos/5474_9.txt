The National Art Gallery unveiled the unprecedented original of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release. The character of the cobbler, a good and good moral individual in the original censored liberation of 1933, is presented here as a follower of philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use people to make their way to the top. It also removes the end of the original version that I suppose is in current VHS versions, and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and power. We hope there will be a re-editing of this movie on DVD for everyone to appreciate its great qualities. Find it.
