Oh, those Italians sneaking. It is not the first time that they founded a film on the source material without the permission or knowledge of the author, in this case, of the novel. Of course, this is not something that is usually Italian, but it was pretty much done in the early days of cinema, especially because they often thought they would get away with it. James M. Cain's editors managed to keep this movie on American screens until 1976, but the film itself grew into a well-known classic. The movie is not as great to watch the 1946 American film but it's a great movie. This, of course, not least due to the film is an extraordinary story, an intriguing story and gives the film some great characters and realism. She follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other cinematic versions of her story, certainly a difference that she has reached an Italian environment. Let the Italians make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feeling about it and are therefore also quite involved in looking. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power to the end, when the movie began to feel a little overhead and collapse in parts. The movie could have ended easily 15 minutes earlier. Still, I have little else to say about this movie. It is simply a very made one, based on an equally large and powerful source material. A pretty impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct several dramatic and memorable films from Italy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
