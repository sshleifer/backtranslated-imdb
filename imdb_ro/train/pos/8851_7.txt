While the title "Before the Devil Knowing You Are Dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the film behaves like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a robbery and continues to get out of control, because two brothers try to escape the misery they have gathered. The cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the brothers mentioned above. Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of a loving brother and the other. Beyond these directors, the act is unimaginable. The story is convincing and is said to have some degree of worth. The narrative structure preserves interesting things, offering different points of view and frequent changes of time. That being said, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat disordered, because it is becoming increasingly apparent that this story is a tragedy, through and over. In total, a pretty impressive debut for first time writer Kelly Masterson. Sidney Lumet's direction is well managed, but I'm more impressed by the fact that she still leads at the age of over eighty. I was less impressed with Carter Burwell's score, but it's not a major distraction. Finally, the film proves to be convincing and while the story and the presentation can have superficial similarities with others, this film remains a unique experience.
