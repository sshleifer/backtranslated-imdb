This was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive observation. I was lucky to have seen this in the UK. It may have been wrong the order of the episode, I do not remember, but at least it was at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got caught from the trailer and neither of us is a big fan of the American series normally. After the pilot, I knew it was special. I missed some episodes and it made you sad and crazy for a week that those people are missing. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than Custer's role. Lucas Black turned into a stunning performance for a child, and Paige Turco was just as good at the Five. And Nick Searcy, of course, as head of the long-standing sheriff. Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits, which I suppose would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. That caused the end to be weak, and you could say they killed him. What made us go what? Why did they do this with one of the best shows so far? Draw exec.
