It's a remixing of many recent movies, but it has fewer stars, smaller complications and a more fuzzy feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (ignorance of them) begins the process of being arranged. In the shortest time, the two strangers are married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who go through similar movements to theirs. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and / or repaired and love flowers. If you saw the private honeymoon Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you saw this movie. The overturning of the plot is the same, there is only one element of surprise in the two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I just liked it because I saw "Darling" (also played by Deol & Khan executives) earlier that day and I liked the chemistry in that, so I said "why not" when my sister suggested I rented Just Married. <br /> <br /> See: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and is the usual dear self in it. Skip it: Because you've had enough of all these nonsense-fest fest! <br /> <br /> C ++
