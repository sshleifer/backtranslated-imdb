But how can you keep up with a baseball team that can not win? For George Knox, it's not easy. As the movie opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend, J.P (Milton Davis Jr.), go on their bikes around the angel stadium. When they return home at home, Roger is surprised to have a visit from his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother's dead! And when he asks his father when they are a family again, the father jokes "I say when the angels win the division championship." So, later, Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When mocker George Knox (Danny Glover) pulls out the pitcher, the pitcher gets upset and struggles with him, and soon the Angels team enters the fight that makes Knox come out of the game. That night, Roger makes a prayer because the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to a basketball, Roger sees real angles coming to the field and helping the left player (Matthew McConaughey) to make a catch, the game (Jay, O Sanders) as he did this. Roger learns from the angel of the head (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles, because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br />
