I recommend this film. Established in the future of the Bladerunner-esquire in 2054 Paris, it is mostly a classical film noir: a lady in danger, her sister trying to find her, a fair policeman fighting against everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotyped and combines a fairly good story with innovative and exciting innovative effects. The movie might remind you of the look of Sin City, but it has a bigger, even more graphic look, which we found very convincing. Each frame, each sequence seems to have been drawn from the desk of a graphic designer. As for the story and the work of art, you can find knots that will return in the 1990s (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and films such as Casablanca, as well as looking for a grim future where our destiny is driven by corporations. Make any excuse you need to watch this movie.
