Certainly NOT the intellectual film with a profound mission, so I do not think it's too much to not understand if you are not Czech. It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite funny, and sometimes maybe a little morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Macháček, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But it does not matter, genre is really different, and these two films should not be compared this way. One netleská hand will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and there is a chance it will succeed. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad film, not the ingenious, but I liked it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
