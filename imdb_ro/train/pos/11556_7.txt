Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and completed their career together. Remember the best of the oldest elders and the weirdest couple that ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most beloved comedy teams in the last 100 for years. Not as raunchy as Pryor and Wilder, instead, they were the classical comedy team that reflects a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as the physical comedy, as well as the mixed mix of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton have known so much. In the strange couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete contrasts that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually themselves, opposes the passing of the joke on the other. It's not your typical movie, it's somehow an age-old comedy with two elders who oppose the two young teenagers in the foreground. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is fun enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
