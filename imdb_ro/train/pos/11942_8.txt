In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how bold he was while he was looking for a piece of shell. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer in the London Tarot Card. He cheats on Reaper and appears to American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in a magical show of magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells him that the killer is aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) . Sondra threw Sid into the investigation, looking for evidence that Peter was the killer. However, she falls in love with him and wonders if Joe Strombel is right in his bowl. "Scoop" is another great comedy by Woody Allen in front of Manhattan, actually again in London. Its ironic and dazzling lines are simply fantastic and I laughed a lot, including the hero's fate in a country where people lead "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny, and Woody Allen is in great shape as a comedian. However, Scarlett Johansson's present mug, of which I am a big fan, has an overwhelming attitude and is annoying at many times, changing the emphasis she attaches to histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely stupid and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious fun and it's worth it. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Scoop? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop? Big Scoop")
