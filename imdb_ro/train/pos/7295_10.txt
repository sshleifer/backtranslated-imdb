I managed to see this at the International Film Festival in New York in November 2005 with my friend. We both were impressed by the complexity of the plot and found it emotionally. He was very well guided by powerful images. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short time. She had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious subject: this movie is about a young woman who is visited by a demon who is helping her with her abusive father. There is also a surprising twist at the end of the year, which caught me without protection. This is going to the Gothic sense. I'd love to see this as a full movie. - Carrie
