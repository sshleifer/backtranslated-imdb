This movie really surprised me. I had doubts at first, but the movie improved even better for every minute. <br /> <br /> It is possible not to look for action looking for the audience, but for those who enjoy an explicit portrait of a very strange killer, man, love, and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not really true for you. The story is somewhat difficult to follow sometimes, but in the end I think it did everything better. The end was unexpected, because you were almost tired to think it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for the act, I think it was good. It will not be an Oscar for a long time, but at least it caught my eye. Gil Bellows portrait of a man in prison is not always perfect, but it's really fun. Shaun Parkes portrait of Clinique's mathematician Bellows prison is great and extremely powerful. On the bottom, I think I'll put Esai Morales in Markie's portrait. Take my advice and watch this movie, whether you love it or you will be disliked!
