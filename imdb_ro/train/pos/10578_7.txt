"Footlight Parade" is just one of many extraordinary funny music that Warner Bros. produced them in the early 1930s to avoid depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series have also been produced in this era, and literally millions of Americans have forgotten their problems for a while and enjoy themselves. While most of the films produced the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only the Foolight Parade had incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before the most famous musicals, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in the most original dance styles, with his arms usually lowered on his side, and his feet make all sorts of skidding and blows. It is easy to see that he enjoys himself and that makes us enjoy him more. While almost all the musical sequences appear at the end of the movie, it's worth waiting. I think this movie was made just before the production code was installed, so some of the costumes and scenes are a little risque. But everything is fun. It does not matter what the plot of the film is, you just know there is a lot of laughter and superlative distribution. Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is best set up. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
