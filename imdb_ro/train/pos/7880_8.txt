The meeting of this pleasant MGM music is accomplished and occasionally funny, dealing with espionage and romanticism, but the focus of the film is duly aligned to the thunder interludes featuring the enormously talented and athletic dance dancing Eleanor Powell, backed by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the top of the bill with Powell, and he and opponent Bert Lahr get most of the comedic minutes, though Skelton is more effective when it is believed to meet Powell's love interest, Virginia O'Brien offering the humor of the film attendant of the dancer. Powell's technical shine is highlighted in an incredible scene where Buddy Rich contributes with his drum skills and needs to be seen several times to allow breathing to achieve his precision. Director Edward Buzzell has a good use of his distribution to move the action well, despite the rather disjointed scenario he has to deal with, and allows Powell's cotangelic impossibility to lead the business, as is the case.
