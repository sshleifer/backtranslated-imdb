I looked at the film today and I just overturned my mind. It's a true masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego and then you will have the real power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie showed it in a magnificent way. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you'll ever see" - remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, which tells us not to give, but to take, which creates our aggression, that it wants to either in control, which creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR has expressed this idea in a surprising way and has shown that the only way to get real control is when you lose control and simply release your personal importance. A great movie!
