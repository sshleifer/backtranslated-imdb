When I read Armistead Maupins' story for the first time, I was taken over by the human drama of Gabriel Nimeni and those who care and loves them. Having said that, we have now been given the cinematic version of an excellent story and we are expected to see the shiny Hollywood past ... Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really done! <br /> <br /> With just the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel's fragile essence and allows us to see his struggle with confidence issues both in the life of his staff (Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we've shown players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young person turns into a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the power itself to continue and advance. It's bad that most people will avoid this movie. I'm just saying that because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role that has not worked before!" PLEASE DO THIS MOVIE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we have to find and live in ourselves to be better people. As the film One Hour Photo, he has grown as an actor and made another quality piece of art. Oh, and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale like Jess steals any scene he's in. the leader of the 1940s also shows his presence on the screen. It's about this hacks hack that they could have their own movie right now!
