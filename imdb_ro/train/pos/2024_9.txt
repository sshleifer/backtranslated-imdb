I liked this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hidden with her little son, from a mysterious past. Like an anglofil who loves romance ... this movie was just my tea tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for a few hours in England in the 1800s. I also have to mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays very magnetically , Gilbert Markham, is a good reason to watch this wonderful production.
