Sure, this is a special 50-year-old car, but do not let yourself be fooled. In my little book, there are a number of smart touches with unexpected humorous dollops. Grab Mrs. Porter Cute, who should keep an eye on the dock. Not only did she steal the scene but also around the whole movie. And where those indie dollar producers came to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not look good in b & w. Yes, the result is crushed around the edges, as illustrated by the number of geese. But, with the exception of a few teenagers, the non-Hollywood distribution works well. Then, the game among the predators and the hot policemen lives so lively and entertaining. Pretty good for a director more home in a pulpit than a soundtrack. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of "juvenile delinquents." Then, McQueen, 27, does not qualify too much in the age department, but manages the young attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, helped alongside, undoubtedly, the captivating title song that had a lot of radio. And, with the exception of the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, input drive or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I am now waiting for the blob to return now, when the polar ice turns, say, the water of the fridge.
