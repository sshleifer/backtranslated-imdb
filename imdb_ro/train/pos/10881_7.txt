"Cut" is a tilting spoof of the slasher genre and basically achieves what it intends to do. Most standard climbers are there; the old creepy house, the forest, the anonymous serial killer, the gore buckets and, of course, the couple interrupted by the killer while doing sex (which is not at all a spoiler). - is the simplicity itself: school movie stupidity is preparing to complete an unfinished masterpiece, unfinished because of a couple's assassins. This also nice - well, messy - features Kylie Minogue in the first drum. They joined one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who absolutely steals the movie because it has all the best tracks. The rest of the cast is well suited to the roles, especially the beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays it right while the chaos and gore are erupting around her. There are lots of red herrings and fake moments of suspense, and there's very little time trying to find out who the killer is because the movie is moving at such a fast pace. It also has a good budgeting look, including some clumsy edits that are probably deliberate. Good soundtrack. If there is a difficulty with this movie, it decides whether it is a reference or tribute to the genre of slasher. Probably a little bit of both.
