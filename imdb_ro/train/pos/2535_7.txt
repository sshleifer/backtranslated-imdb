Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately, Rukh was contaminated by Radius and begins to shine in the dark - and touching him causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh starts to become mad due to radius and antidote and intends to kill everything he thought was wrong. the "effects" that make Karloff shining in the dark are ridiculous, but this is still a cool chiller. It moves fast, it has a great atmosphere (notice Rukh's "home" and the movie starts in a dark and rainy night), and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) offer extraordinary performance. There is also good action by Franke Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's okay, but just a note under all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too far for me to swallow. I still felt that way. I give her a 7.
