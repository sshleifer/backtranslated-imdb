I was surprised by the low rating that this movie received from viewers. I saw her one night late on TV and hit my face - I think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. However, I remember pretty well, with a beautiful or two-turn, and an interesting ambition on a wind farm. Michael Pollard looks duly to take on the role, which pretty much sums up the unexpected promise of his career, and everyone is playing pretty ahead. I certainly recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes that might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tamed, which is a shame, since contemporary "edginess" is often only used as an instrument necessary marketing, kind of clamoring just to get noticed.
