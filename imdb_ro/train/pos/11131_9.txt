I had been through a list of Oscar winners and I was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture in 1969. But after seeing him, I'm no longer surprised. It was well before his time in terms of his style, cinema, and flashback use to help develop the character of Joe Buck. The most amazing thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short film. I think Voight captured naivety and viciosity when he challenged. The two scenes that really caught me were after biting in the theater and when the oldest man called him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if he really did or is about to do something terrible. I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take over this role. Otherwise, it could have been broadcast after the graduate. However, this was considered an excellent moment for a reason.
