One of my favorite movies so far begins as an adventure through the wild side of a four-man team in Atlanta. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it becomes a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unconsciously ignores his friends in the worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears to be an action movie, the second half brings the spectator into a totally different story, with our people forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, each person will be forced to deal with the scars of what was just a weekend on the river but was moved into a struggle for survival. The movie (except for quite obvious bullets) is very well directed and shot beautifully in a nature paradise that steals your breath. And the photo is great. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are excellent in showing how a single event can destroy four different lives in different ways, linked only to the same mistake.
