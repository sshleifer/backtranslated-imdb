I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... really a tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the guy in the heart of the story lost his legs in an accident. It's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically disabled. The love that arose between that character and the woman entering his life showed nicely how I would like to believe that love can heal one's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 years when she made this movie ... it was wonderful that the woman so lively that she managed to revive her heart. Unfortunately, since her family is rich and she is not, "problems" are developing. It's playing on HBO several times this month.
