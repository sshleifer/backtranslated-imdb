After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should have realized he could ever approach the portrait of Brett, "one of the most exciting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can not be another. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I have to admit, a close second, but it is still second. One might argue that Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the absolute top productions he gave to Mr. Brett and that I would agree with that. However, when everything is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only truly "made" actor Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject and we, the audience, let us enjoy the unique performance of Mr.Brett. Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
