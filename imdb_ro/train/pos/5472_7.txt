Barbara Stanwyck is a tough, hardworking waitress (a prostitute in her father's hands) who escapes to New York and uses her feminine witches to get a job by going to Mortgage and Escrow, deputy secretary of the the second commander at the bank. The dramatic study of a female character who is not afraid to be futile has not lost her power over the years, Barbara acting in a storm (portraying a woman who teaches herself to be the only first-class actress). By sharing a little Nietzschean philosophy in her confusing life, this lady crushes the feeling, but never loses our fascination, our veneration. He's hot, hot, but he's not a bitch, not a man who eats or does not eat a woman. This gallop is all for himself and, while we expect him to finally learn about real values ​​of life, her journey up and down the scale of success offers heated and sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) is doing well in a prime role as assistant in the folders' desk, although all the support players are pretty good. *** from ****
