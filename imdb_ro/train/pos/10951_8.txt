Big S is not playing with taboos or does not force an agenda like that, says Mencia or Chapelle (though I like both of them). She clearly states in subtle, subliminal remarks. Her show will not change the world, nor is it meant to. But, along with hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's former boyfriend, Jay Johnston, "renowned," this is an average show with an appetite for destruction! My part was completely destroyed by the first episode. Look, I like this woman and like her renowned boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just offers lines and lets the beholder run with him. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like "Mary Poppins," in the second episode, when she sings in fake birds to quickly hit the comments about society and old age subsumption nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it in the most recent lippo-suction or boob job).
