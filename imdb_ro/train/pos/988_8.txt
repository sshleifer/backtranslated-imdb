I liked this movie. When a man who died in a $ 40 million gold heist dies, his cellmate is used as a "bait" to lead his killer killer to a high-tech killer (by having an implanted monitoring device in his jaw,). It's a spy-like action film with enough comic scenery to keep it light. He reminded me of the State Enemy. A good plot and pretty good plot.
