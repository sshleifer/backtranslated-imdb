Always enjoy the great role of Drew Barrymore and his excellent performance in this movie, where a very complicated young man (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts," 2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and shares a George Newbern, Patrick Highsmith, Far Harbor, 96. Many strange things start to happen to Holly, and she's trying to find her brother in a mental institution after she killed her father. If you look close enough, you will see that Drew Barrymore's mother in real life appears as her mother in this photo. If it was not for the good action of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should be seen only on the Halloween night! However, surely it has surprises in END !!!!
