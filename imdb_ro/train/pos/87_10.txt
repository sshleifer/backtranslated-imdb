This Oscar winning short film may be one of the biggest of its kind. He spoke completely without dialogue, is a visual treatment of a boy who buys a golden fish, puts it in love in a bowl, then goes to school, leaving unprotected gold fish and an open-minded window. After a while, a neighboring orange camp comes around, enters through the window, and slowly heads toward the bowl. The fish know that something is happening and gets very excited. As the cat approaches the bowl very much, the fish jumps. The cat catches the fish, puts it back in the bowl, and goes out through the window it came in, just as the boy, without knowing what happened, returns. This movie was amazingly filmed with real animals; the way Cousteau has received these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I just want this movie to be available now for people to see; I saw it only once in 1959 when it was originally released, but it was unforgettable.
