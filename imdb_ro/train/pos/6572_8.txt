One of my favorite films for many years has been "The Last Hero of Action"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger has decided to stutter my fun by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can not stand any movie that can have a hand. Adventures of Jake Speed ​​in fact toys with some themes similar to those in Ultima ... Hero; so I was delighted to find her on DVD, so I was able to watch these themes played so well. Despite the "plot-in-plot" involving white slavery during a civil war of the African nation, it is not a movie of action. The story of the "plot inside a plot" is actually about a question that the film has no intention of solving: Jake Speed ​​is a real person who helps the heroine to save her sister from the merchant white-slave; or is it actually a fictitious character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered a universe that really exists only in a series of cellulose novels)? I suggest that this is not clearly defined in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the public might want from such a fictional adventure-story universe. This is actually a rich theme, whose potential weight is lightened by the amusing sense of film and humor. There are some weaknesses in the movie - primarily cinema, which makes the movie look like a show TV. And the rhythm does not happen occasionally. But I like these characters a lot and I like the adventure they live in, however bad. And I find it just fascinating that this adventure actually takes place in a novel. Stay under more views - looks good!
