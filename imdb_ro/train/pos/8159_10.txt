Good. This movie is pure pleasure. She has a horror so violent, so violent, with a little suspense and a black comedy. The dentist begins to lose his mind and is pleased to follow him. This movie is for some people, though. Or you will love him completely or you will kill him completely. A good movie to rent and watch when you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
