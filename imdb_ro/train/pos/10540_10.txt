I can only agree with the taxi that this is a fantastic movie and must be seen by a wide audience. Imagination on screen, visual interpretation of the script, humor is constantly surprising. The two causes are wonderful and really bear the movie. My advice would be not to see a trailer, rent the movie and look without expectation. I have rented out of the blockbuster, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion and that's always good if it's not just "that was bad." I liked this movie, you just can not see precious stones every day. This should become a favorite of worship. Try it, you can feel the same thing in the same way as me.
