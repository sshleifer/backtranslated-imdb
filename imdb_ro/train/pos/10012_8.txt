The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles but makes a very interesting character in a somewhat weird, but very different film. I can guarantee you have never seen such a movie before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's a big plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that came out in 2006. It has a fascinating performance in a movie with great content, a dramatic feeling. This is not an Americanized film. Nor is it a predictable movie. You just feel like it's a movie that has secrets that you find it hard to fix. This is not an excellent movie that has everything, but hell is a damn and very original movie.
