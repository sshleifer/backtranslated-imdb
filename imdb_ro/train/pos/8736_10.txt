You'll be amazed at the incredibly sophisticated animation of your computer, and the novelty probably will not stop at first, second or third viewing, but you'll be attracted to the characters that are so simple and yet exciting that you can actually find care for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish because of the environment. Disney continues to hold the title of "greatest animation in the world" with "A Bug's Life" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments is the enchanting "delight" added at the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of such exits where, as I said, the VHS box has an alternate version per tape. The DVD also has "Gerry's Game," which is a delightful PIXAR that has been featured before the movie in the theater. Is this the far superior insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", who in all fairness is pretty good, but he lacks something in animation, story and character. If you look at the voices of the stars in both films, "Antz" is mostly expressed with a big name "movie" with some familiar TV voices, where "A Bug's Life" is exactly the opposite with "TV" playing with Kevin Spacey as the only exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious. Dreamworks can not be blamed or surprised, but when you go head to head with Disney, you cut your work for yourself. This is the kind of film that almost makes me want to have children to share with. You do not think for a moment that this is just a movie for kids, though.
