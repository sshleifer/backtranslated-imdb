If the lion king was a Hamlet version of Disney, then King of Lion 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead. Like Tom Stoppard's film, we will see the action from the point of view of two minor characters in the original: Timon, the mocker with a plea to sing the song at the feet of a hat, and Pumbaa, a warthog with flatulence problems. Following their story - rather than Simba - we get to see why all the animals leaned when Simba was presented at Pride Rock. We find out what Timon and Pumbaa have done to decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to get Scar. And we'll find out how they handled hyena. Nathan Lane, while Timon gets the best joke but is backed by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg who resume their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their distinctive voices to two new characters: Mom and Uncle Timon. The only downside is the constant stop-start-back-fast roll-out device, which does not always contribute to the progress of history. That being said, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughter than any other Disney movie, Hakuna Matata deserves to look - if only for the hot tub scene, which is still amusing, despite being unpredictable.
