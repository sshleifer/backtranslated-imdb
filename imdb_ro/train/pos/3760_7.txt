It may not have been for academic prizes and, of course, it's pretty cheesy, but it's just so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. Although I like Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is more fun for me. Death is a hilarious flippin, and Bill and Ted are even more crushed. People are giving me the love of this film, but only the very demanding filmmakers will say it's not really fun. If you like this, you'll probably also be a fan of the world of Wayne, Dude Where is my car, and Dumb and Dumber. You acknowledge that, though foolish, they make you gloat and overturn the ice box. So watch them just for kicks and giggles!
