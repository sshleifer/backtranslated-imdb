Brilliant brilliant of Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and the scenes of love in the clothes store are in second place. Corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in the Blazing Caps. Taking the lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being an old man, selling his boss, and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer raises indifferently: "I am a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of Larry Sanders, is fantastic here and as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. Its character is worse than usual. The scene of the hospital and the stage where it invades a demolition site are the classic houses. Look for the stage of the legs and the two big fighters who fight (one bleeds). This movie improves every time I see it (which is quite often).
