I saw this movie on TV the night before, but it was a disturbing experience that stayed with me until today. The premise may seem a bit neo-original - because of an earthquake, a hidden underground storage of a toxic nervous agent in the hills above a small town is broken, and a microscopic amount of the substance finds its way into food supply. City dwellers lose the ability to exercise their hold on any whim and the basic desire that floats through our minds from time to time, and that we normally know that we simply do not have to act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but to me, which has only added to creeping uneasiness as people's behavior slowly begins to do. There are several surrealistic and very disturbing scenes that have remained in my memory all the time. It raises interesting questions about what we could all be capable of if we gave our fiercest instincts. I liked? I'm not sure that "enjoy" is the right word. Does it make me think? Categorical. I'm still thinking about that. Fearful things.
