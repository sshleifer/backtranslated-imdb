This movie has a strong philosophical end. But this end only makes sense if you look at the movie from the beginning. The alienation of the young people at the end of the 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of "Zabriskie Point." Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much experience of acting, which improves the message of the film. untoward, give a sense of realism, as both players appear to be emotionally detached from the turbulence around them.This is not a scenario-based film.Without the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual with stunning cinema. seemingly alter-worldly and perfect in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria, I would have replaced Pink Floyd's poorly-themed music with the more intense music of the Doors, and many scenes shout for "Riders On The Storm." "It's different, it's unique, it's artistic and imaginative, and desert deserts are beautiful." Over the years, "Zabriskie P oint "seems increasingly attractive. It transmits the atmosphere of the late 1960s to America. It is amazingly artistic, in a way bohemian. The last eight minutes of the film are fascinating from a philosophical point of view.
