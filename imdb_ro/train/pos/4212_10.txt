Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a rough, brutal and well-done film about a pocket (Richard Widmark), which has unexpectedly acquired a highly secret microfilm and is becoming a target for agents espionage. Jean Peters is also involved as a tough side, used as a courier by Richard Kyley's ex-boyfriend. It's the film-noir at its best, and although the performances are very good, the actress of the great character Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. While Moe, a tired street seller who sells ties to the neck (and who also sells information), she is extraordinary in a role that has brought him another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Oscar and has never won. This should have been the role they have done for her!
