The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one constantly interested in retrospectives of childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interfering with serial killers queues, just can not go wrong. The plot itself, the story itself and the essence of the movie, is fun. It's kind of a story that director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, and in that case he really did a lot with him. From the beginning to the end you are anticipated more and more about what is happening and where the film unfolds, and the creativity that lies behind this story is first class. I felt like this movie was made gorgeous from the beginning to the end and one of those rare stones that seemed to have no boring boredom - the action flowing neat, fast and tight from one scene to the next. It demonstrates how far people can go: to do such horrible things to loved ones and to do such evil acts in the name of God when disillusioned as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in "overturning" and takes the concept of morality as a whole. Generally, this is a movie we can easily forget, but I would recommend not to do the same thing to check this movie - it's very much worth your time.
