I like Ashley Judd and I think all of her movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in Paradise is one of the best. It's a very underestimated movie that you really have to watch almost to appreciate. A story about a woman who tries to do it alone and refuses to give up temptations that make her life easier. Some of her films, such as Kiss the Girls and Time to Kill, probably did better at boxing and video rentals. Also, there were very good movies, but take your time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that it's one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
