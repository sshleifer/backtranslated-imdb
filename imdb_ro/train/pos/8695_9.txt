A long time ago, I watched this film from the middle on the cable. Then I fell in love with Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Raoul's food. I was convinced she was the hottest woman on the screen. I was biased about this movie. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie they have on the original tape.
