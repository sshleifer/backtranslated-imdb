I have to give How Move an almost perfect assessment because the content is really wonderful. As commented on by a previous commentator, I have no idea how this movie was in the list of 100 IMDB movies! It's absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those that share the theme of dance - can not have a candle to it from the point of view of its combination of top-notch, credibility and stunning dance routines. to finish the basic story (not just to win a competition), it is very easy to get angry and is surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this sense are two-dimensional in any way, and by the end of the movie, it is very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And, even if you are not the type of crying, you could bend a moment before praying the credits). I recommend this film to dancing lovers and, even more, to those who can appreciate a stunning and well-behaved story. How does she move is of course not sure (what is the movie?), But it is certainly cutting over movies that use beautiful faces to conceal a semi-ripening plot and / or characters lacking substance. The actors and directors in this film make a very realistic walk, which is equally enthusiastic due to the amazing talent of the dancers!
