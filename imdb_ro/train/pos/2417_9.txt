"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen, period. Sure, it's a low budget, but it's a non-stop comedy tour. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his brother-in-law soon asks him how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm going somewhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Of course, the delivery of Candy sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy is also turning into a hilarious performance as a helpless director. A clip of the horrific movie of Kung Fu U will roll you through. So if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie enough.
