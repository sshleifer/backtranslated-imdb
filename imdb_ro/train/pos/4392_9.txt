I liked this movie very much. Toby Maguire offers great performance like Jake. He has to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines in the whole movie. He was extremely good at this, though I never saw him deliver a comic line before. The film engages you in characters and even makes you wonder what it means to get from everyone. I did not know what to expect for Jewel's performance, but I think he did pretty well. Many interesting scenes. A good ride. I'm absolutely a fan of Maguire. Check the rules of the cider house. One of all times.
