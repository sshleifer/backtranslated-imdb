I have not seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When I was asked about my favorite movies, this is what I always seem to mention first. There are certain films (such as Dark City and Breaking the Waves) that seem to touch a place inside you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that it makes an impression through the life of the spectator, not unlike a life-changing event such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shaken" me when I first saw it. She left me an emotional hangover that lasted a few days.
