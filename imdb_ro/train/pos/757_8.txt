I have to be honest. I looked and I enjoyed this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious and hoarse. Yes, there is much humor for all tastes. If you are the kind of humor that deals with the fun of falling people on skateboards, for example, then you will have a great time for that. Or, if you enjoy extreme action extreme action stunt people, you will also have a great time. And if you enjoy scathic humor and extreme situations oh, you will enjoy the show. I like all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SANCHEZ" offers. I like to laugh hard with the situations of the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to it. So, if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, make an extreme stupidity test in English in this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. Not recommended for those who are slightly offended or excluded. Now these guys have to see a psychologist. Especially the character of Paco.
