There are worship stuff. My friends and I meet each other once a year to enjoy this movie. Very funny and very dry. I've seen this movement dozens of times, and I still did not like it. The actors are funny and feel better with every view! If you enjoyed "Moroni from space", you like this. A great game about the World War. I love the red-necked ravage to get the aliens, bug on the hood, DOD, the popular heat exchanger, the minefield, the red camo, exceeding the speed limit by 1800Mph! - I'll get the bucket! Very funny. I would love to come to DVD! Watch negative reviews see for yourself!
