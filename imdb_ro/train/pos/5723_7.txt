So, being a pretty deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I saw one that made me jump (or be nervous). out ... much better than the ring. the thing I do not receive is the fact that so many people we talked with after the movie thought it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, so be it ... I know what I liked and it takes a fair amount to make me feel really scared, so I have to say that it is worth watching. now you may be disappointed with the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line because the plot goes a little further to help build the story (I think if it were shown in chronological order it would be ruined everything.) I'm glad this movie had very few bleeds in it ... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you do not have to splash red stuff over the set to make people afraid.
