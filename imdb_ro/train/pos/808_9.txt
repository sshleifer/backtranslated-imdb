I just want the Jedi Return to be directed by someone else, that is, there are too many ewoki scenes, completely useless. Besides, our heroes seem to be different people: Princess Leia no longer battles with Solo, Luke seems boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before and Yoda just dies. But there are many great things going on this episode that I just can not hate. Some Hobbies 1 - Jabba Hut 2 - Sail Barrel Sequence Sequence. 3 - Emperor (now bad) 4 Wizards follow the endor forest. 5 - The Last Battle. 6 - Seduction scene on the dark side. 7 - Return of Anakin to the good part of the force. 8- And last feast. Some of them are so good they can bring tears to the eyes. If some scenes were cut off and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as Episode 4 and 5, but it is still extraordinary. 9 of 10.
