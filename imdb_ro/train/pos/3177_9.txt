Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There's nothing I did not like about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget movie there. That you do not have to spend too much to create something worth watching. There is something to please everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you ever chose a dork in high school. if you ever parked in the city. if you have any sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the type of movie that will be around for a long time and will end up resurfacing once Adam makes a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
