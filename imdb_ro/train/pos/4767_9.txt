I do not see how this show looks like OC. <br /> <br /> First of all, OC centers around adolescents and their parents try to get through life. North Shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to lead the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Secondly, OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. And why would Fox make a show just like one of the other shows in the same network? I think this is a great show, with good actors, for the most part. It has a good story and a plot. I like the events that happen and how people deal with them and solve them. The latest episode was surprising about how the story broke. It was not predictable that most stories in most of the shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it in the air.
