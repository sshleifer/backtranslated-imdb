If you saw Dogtown and Z-Boys or if you had any interest in seeing the true, non-caricature, America's "real American" part, then the Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal," an easy term if it ever is one, but very suitable if you can take any form of literal meaning from it - it is a 100% documentary document, but with all the drama of a work, and the complete sense of love, an expert and knowledge inspired by the direction and story of Stacy Peralta, this film will lead you to a great wave, holding you completely enthusiastic about everything you are given the privilege of see. <br /> <The film is a symphony, crafted as well as Beethovens 9, which begins beautifully with its prelude to Hawaii, drawing deeply the human emotions of Santa Cruz and ending with turbulence, triumph and crescendo in the works of Laird Hamiltons, again in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classical music; such as the 9th Beethoven, Ride of Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only song you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
