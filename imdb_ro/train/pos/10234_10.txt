<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of Brothers neo-Shaw action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. When someone watches the movie, they may feel that battle scenes are just mediocre in nature, but that does not matter, it's the attitude and atmosphere that matter. This great movie has both! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" framework. However, these are not the comic incarnations of joy that you can see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these boys struggle to death with brutal results. What makes the movie even better is that anyone can die at any time, there is no retention. Too bad they do not make movies like this.
