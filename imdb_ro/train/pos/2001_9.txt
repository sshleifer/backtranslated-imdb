I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968, on a large Boston cinema screen when I was a young teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was delighted to see that this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for the best film of last year. <br /> <br /> The success of Oliver! both on the stage and on the screen reminded me that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends at Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, part of the literary heritage of all English, was admirably brought to London by Lionel Bart of the UK. His charming music then became a hit in New York and around the world. Adaptation to the film was made in England in the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The music sets and numbers are wonderful. The song "Who Will Buy?" asked hundreds of actors, and the British film director really deserved his Oscar to put them together in a perfect manner. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but it is largely a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Other movie studios from Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing also have given the world many treasure films over the years.
