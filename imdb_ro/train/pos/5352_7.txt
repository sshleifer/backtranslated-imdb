This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I saved many of you when you had to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you would not like this movie. If the case is the other, you probably will love it very much. It's as simple as that. Now, if you read this, I expect you to like Arnold. Good for you! He is good enough not him. Running Man is a typical Arnold feature. It has an ordinary retro-world that we know so well since the 80's of B-Sci Fi, it has a lot of terrorists, violence and explosions, a beautiful heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <In this case, the evil adversary is the governing government since 1984, which uses television as an effective control of crowds with gladiator-like shows. Arnold, of course, finishes in one of these shows and turns it from top to bottom, with little help from the two confederates and from Amber well. It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future with beautiful matte paintings and sets to help him. He's hopeless for 80 years, but I find it charming. By acting differently, Arnold does his usual and shouts things with the help of a single stone lining. Heroine Amber is, to say slightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtlety named Damen Killian is a typical evil television man. Despite all the flaws, the film shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also offers some futuristic digital video editing, allowing the wicked to change the faces of a video to trick the audience. This does not seem futuristic today, which is a bit alarming. If you saw Arnold's movies before then you know when to look at that. Enjoy.
