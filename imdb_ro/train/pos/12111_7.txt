When I started looking at this anime, I never thought that something about making bread might be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started looking at him, anime simply went into the world of bread production, I was comprised. The greatest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very smart and very funny, recurring gags. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these disadvantages are not seen so much in the first episodes, thanks to the wonderful work on this anime, it begins to appear in the last 20 episodes when the recurring reactions and glands are just getting old and are not as fun as before. As for me, if the anime ended with episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes leave only a bitter taste that unfortunately can not be washed by the wonderful 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
