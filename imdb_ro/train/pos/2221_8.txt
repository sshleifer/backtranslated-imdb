One night I went over that on the Bravo satellite station. Initially, out of curiosity, I decided to look at her. To be honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful, and her body looks good. it would have been wasted like a butler, but not after seeing the whole movie! My only real flu is the action of supporting characters, especially the actor who plays Melnik. The Christ is bad, the prison guard of Hank is terrible too. to get drunk and do bad attempts to move to Wanda's co-guard, though, fortunately, for us the viewer and for Hank, he gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for execution. This movie is good for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
