Dick Tracy is easily the best comic film ever made. The film has the same feel as the comic book, keeping the respect for the color scheme. The Batman series climbed, fell, climbed and fell again. Dick Tracy has a real power of residence as something that both adults and children can enjoy. Good boys triumph over evil without blood and gorilla to get the point over. Al Pacino does a great adaptation of Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best job from far is Warren Beatty, who represents Dick Tracy, as well as Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until it appears on DVD on April 2, 2002, my band is wearing thin.
