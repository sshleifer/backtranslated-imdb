Great fun from start to finish. Wonderful show by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some reversals and many action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as the rough Sheriff and Railsback as a "villain". I have to recommend this movie to all fans of action and adventure! 10/10
