Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as Alex's calm-hit. All the performances here are very good, the intrigue is exciting and fun. Alex, a married man (like his father) with a small son, goes through a middle-aged crisis and wants to give up his family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place meets with free young people will blow Sarah, whom he falls in love with. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch if you like mature exciting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
