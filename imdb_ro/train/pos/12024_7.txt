The best thing about this movie is that he's alone - he did not have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would have been nice to have included some of the original characters in the new story and to see how their lives developed. Sinclair as in the original is excellent and offers movies the best comic moments while trying to handle strange and embarrassing situations, but the supportive distribution is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth must be congratulated for a courageous attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the movie is finally erroneous and does not have the warmth of the original
