I like movies and have comics, and the comics are different from the film, but still I would give it: 10 out of 10. It was great. If the movies have become more wonderful. I would have her children. And I'm a woman. Read comics you will not regret. Yes, in this film, since Brian P., the artist for whom he died, we do not have nearly as good artistic work. I mean seriously, do not misunderstand me that these people did wonderful, but different versions for different people. Different strokes for different people, as they say. Any guy who does not beat her is crazy, or she does not like women, or you know just the crazy plan. If I could count on my fingers how in love and how many times I read comic books, I would certainly break my fingers, but it's always my toes.
