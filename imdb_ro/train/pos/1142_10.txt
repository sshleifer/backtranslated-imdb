until HBO began resuming it this month. I remember laughing aloud in the theater in 1991 and now again in my living room. If I see it, I have to look. There is no doubt. This is more fun for me than other more popular spoofs such as Airplane! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes such as "Sudden speech! The latest symptoms of brain fever! It could blow at any time!" put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg has not been so funny since "Jumpin 'Jack Flash". Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. turn into superb performances as expected. I started to give 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of movie she should be presenting, there is nothing to change or improve it. So, 10 is. I have to get this on DVD, that's all.
