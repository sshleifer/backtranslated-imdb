this is a great movie, makes the appearance of the 1950s elegantly elegant. Kim Novak is intriguing and convincing as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are wonderful, from Jack Lemmon, because they disturb Nicky Ernie Kovacs as author of Magic in Mexico, working at Magic in Manghattan, Elsa Lanchester as a brave aunt and witch. And then there is the cat - I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have called a Pyewacket cat, but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart does not look at his place, but just as much as his character is out of this strange pussy of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the happy romantic end, which we believe, because the movies of this age have those happy terms. Gillian and Shep are surely chances to be happy after Rose and Charlie Allnut in the African Queen (another extraordinary movie)
