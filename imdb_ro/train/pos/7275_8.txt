Not Strings Features attached Carlos Mencia makes stand-up that makes us laugh and think. Not only complains about racial problems (as many harassers say) but also talks about the best way to remove illegal immigrants from the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are more crazy than Arab terrorists ... why no one should pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in heaven ... a theory of the way Easter (so Big Ups to Day of Jesus ) began ... watching the Passion of Christ - and its sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not it is affected by Jesus ... how should you treat a physically disabled society ... and even if you have the right to say a joke or not. He also never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to speak the truth, to say what we think and not to be afraid if others are offended. Carlos is the bomb.
