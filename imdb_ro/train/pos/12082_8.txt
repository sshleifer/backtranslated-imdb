Watching this movie strictly based on the reviewers' ratings, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although it has a very low budget, it has signs of intelligent ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I wake up thinking that her sense of isolation would have improved with an outside blow focused on her face and then moving back to include the house and the isolated location . And lo! the next scene was the last photo of the house standing alone on the edge of the waterfront. There are other examples of how an intelligent director can raise his movie to a very thriller. Scientists will certainly see them, but they should be sure they will not be disappointed. As far as performances are concerned, George Macready is his usual self, who barely maintains his quiet, yet suggesting a painless violence capacity. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a girl who is not a stupid person who is not about to submit without a fight. But Dame May Witty, boy, really made me doubt my eyes and think she could get rid of her bad schemes. A really tough diamond and not to be missed.
