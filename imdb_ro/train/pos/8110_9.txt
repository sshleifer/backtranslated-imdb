Amazing effects for a movie of this moment. A mayor of the futility of war and how war becomes a nurturer of himself. A great thing about this movie is that it is now the public domain and is available at archive.org. No fee, no required entry. Look at her in one session and you'll be propelled. I'm going to share this blow with as many people as possible, as I've never heard of before and I'm a natural scientist. <br /> <br /> I would like to see how others react to this film. <br /> <br /> Watch him. what do you think?
