Hotel Du Nord is a guilty drama in which Marcel Carne interpreted an entertainment story of bad love that also acts as a revolt against the cruel world. The film is based entirely on a pair of unhappy lovers. Pierre and Renee have been wrong when they thought suicide would put an end to their misery. Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm because its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment. There is an element of solidarity as everybody multiplies at Hotel Du Nord to eat, etc. Marcel Carne remained faithful to the spirit of the films produced in the 30s and 40s as Hotel Du Nord has some nostalgia. while recreating the life of Parisian roads was able to create a kind of nostalgia for black and white, offering a unique genre of poetic realism for oeuvre. Du Nord Hotel can be called as a quintessential cinematic populism. The 14 July ball scene on the banks of the Saint Martin Canal remains a magnificent sequence. The movie I'm popular with people can be judged from the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared a national monument.
