A very good film during the war that shows the effects of war on a hometown boy who loses his vision of Guadalcanal and has to come home and adapt with family and friends. An excellent cast of the actor helps make this movie really fun. Eleanor Parker's girlfriend role was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such an innocence for her in this film. Ann Doran's role was as satisfying as all her small supporting roles. I especially like the native aura of Phildelphia prehistory. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene on Guadalcanal has really shown the horror our soldiers face during this epic battle. A very meritorious film and one that should not be forgotten
