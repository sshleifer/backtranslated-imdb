Why shit is this movie so low? I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know every line for this movie. It's obvious that I like this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators and the new America America doll masterpiece) play the characters of Joe Cooper, Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish". Basically, they are called Coop and Remer throughout the film. As the movie begins, it reminds us of the world of hunger corruption with money that starts with paid sports, even going to the end, to make a "Townsell". I have to quote this part of the film because it's true with some sporting beginnings: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for Toronto Arganauts, plus a season like a larger at Desert Inn I'm glad to play here in Miami. "His agent leans back," Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important piece of the film. So, it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and they realize that they are still nothing as they talk to their old colleagues. Besides, they create BASEketball sport after being challenged by what was probably high school basketball heroes. After he angrily, the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually one day after they invented the game. As the film follows, we find that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only remaining sporting heroes. The story follows blackmail zany, the cheerleaders at Milwaukee Beers and the humor so absurd that it will let you cry for longer. Look at him, he's hilarious.
