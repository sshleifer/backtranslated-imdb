Anybody else crying tears of joy when watching this movie? I like! One of my first top movies of all time. It makes me feel good. I'm looking at the closure production number with all the cast-out members over and over and over !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the baby girl, IMHO! I did not see the song, but it angers me when I read reviews that say the song was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The filming process will rarely provide a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I think only because of the fear of alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen do not change more than they are. This is a very good movie, it is very satisfactory. That's all you need to know!
