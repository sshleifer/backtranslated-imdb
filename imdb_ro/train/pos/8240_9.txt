I was also at hand for the premiere in Toronto. This movie was a kind of comfort when I thought I would not be able to come in to see my first choice. Well, I was completely blown up. When I arrived at the theater, I would remember a little more than the basic plot of the movie (yes, in fact, I forgot who was in it). Amazing performances of the entire concert. Carrie-Anne Moss was wonderful in a true departure of her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think not since Chaplin has an actor who played so brilliantly, with no lines. The kids were also wonderful. Be sure to check this if you have the chance. And, by the way, I have to see the first choice anyway - and that was much better.
