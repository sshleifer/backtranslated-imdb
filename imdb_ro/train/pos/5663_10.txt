14 years since the launch of this show and is still the best show ever made. The writing was first grade and production was none. This show would never have done today and that this is a shame. I hope that if you think about finding this show to look at you. <br /> <br /> AG came out in the year when I left high school when TV fav was the files x this gives you an idea of ​​why I first entered this show. AG was a much better program with better writing, but only one reason? I know it's not the only program to receive just one season. Another example that comes to mind is the only gunslinger (the x files are detached) had a good writing and it was fun, but it only received one season. It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We also have to remember that this show was around before the shows, such as the twilight made dark "cold" shows, so I think this would have allowed, Also, the show goes down hill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
