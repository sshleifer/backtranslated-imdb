This has some excellent spots, but the length of the movie can not support the thin plot. It's about other sailors in the holiday film, zippier than "Watch the fleet" at Astaire, but not as good as "On the City". Kathryn Grayson is gentle, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their number "If you know Susie" is hilarious, as I compose the song as she plays it. "I asked her" is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and appear to be inserted to show their singing rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, there are support actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton, and an unlikely, yet unstable scenario, Jose Iturbi, as well as himself, to watch. Kelly is the star of the movie, though the third bill and it's interesting to see him interacting with the kids, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be flames and grabs Kelly's character. He also visits a school that gives children a fictional story about his life in the Pomoran Marine (!), Which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances a charming chance at the Mexican Dance Hat, with a very thin little girl, Sharon McManus, who is entranced and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice, but a little too long. A taster of better musicians.
