All I've heard is how stupid the animation is. It may not fit what everyone expects, but look that way. Would you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was made dry and stony. It was great to see his character transform into this movie, considering it will probably be as close to the live action as we ever will. I hope to be a follow-up very soon. If we want live action, I think we can be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death will be good in the movie. But as such, it is my personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are wrong DEAD. He did not want any money.
