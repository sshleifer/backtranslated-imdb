Paul De Vierde Man of Paul Verhoeven (Fourth Man) is one of the most impressive thrillers I've ever seen. It was indeed a pleasant surprise. The story relates to the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), while he is lured into a relationship with the beautiful hairstyle Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but Gerard's twisted mind may be more of a story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and agitated sexual imagery, it truly draws you in the story, you do not want to look, but you can not deviate. This is by far the best film of Verhoeven (perhaps the second only for Robocop). True Fourth person is not for everyone, some of the sexual scenes are quite free (ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked.) This is one of those movies what you need to know how it ends, a true thing he has in the Hitchcock tradition, convincing, controversial and thrilling, I even liked the spider's metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
