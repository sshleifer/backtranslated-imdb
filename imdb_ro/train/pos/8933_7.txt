Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the movie does not need to tell a story, that it's enough to create an experience that allows the spectator to take the ingredients and do what they want. Apparently, the idea in a most nonlinear film is the oldest living on the French-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose heart condition is increasingly threatening his life . He has a small-family son who often meets him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and to revive a long-lasting relationship with a son he had formed a Tahitian woman years ago. What Denis does with this sketch of a story is the use of her room to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vast nature, human interaction with humans towards animals, etc. Most of the time, the movie makes no sense, but because we're trying too hard to connect all the pictures in beautiful pictures. Life is like this: we look, see, see, integrate, process, and do what we will do. Using this form of filming (as it did in the weirdly beautiful "Beau Travail") Claire Denis developed a signature technique. Whether or not the spectator finds the reward of the finished product, it has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an exciting and exciting film from a visual point of view, but many viewers will find too little talk about very little. Perhaps watching again will change that. Grady Harp
