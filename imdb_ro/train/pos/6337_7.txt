I had a morbid fascination with the tornadoes for over 40 years, because my fifth-grade teacher, a native Texan, told about the story he had seen in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived my entire life in the states of the Middle Atlantic where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as those in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in NJ, decade. I enjoyed family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was near, Dan knew what he had to do, and he probably learned it at school because they know that tornado safety is an important topic in some parts of the US, where these storms are more common. Nevertheless, the characters in the film did two things that some people think they should do or are safe in tornadoes, but they should not be made or insecure. When the siren sounded first Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, this has been told to people, but tornado safety websites now advise not to do so. People also appeared hidden in a highway road. This method was made popular by a 1990 film by a T.V. crew. during a relatively weak tour in Kansas. However, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be snatched out of these tangles. This happened during a May 1999 outbreak in Oklahoma. The tornadoes in this movie hit in the autumn, which is not a common moment for them to happen. (Then one of my close encounters took place in late September). They also traveled from northwest to southeast, while most such storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northeast. However, this is not so unusual. A famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 1990s, went in that direction (like the one in my next close encounter). I think the movie should have been set in the spring. This film was based on a book that, in turn, was based on a real event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still a compelling story.
