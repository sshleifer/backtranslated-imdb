The events of September 11, 2001 shrouded this Oscar-winning ceremony with a silence of one minute before the monument in memoriam, and there was not much in the way of singing all the extraordinary dance comedy we could expect from it but it was not a bad thing at all. Entertainment was more or less limited to a LOTR that he sent with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it. The rest of the show has been taken with nominated clips and I must admit that it was actually more enjoyable than the numbers of songs and dances that have been seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric David Letterman a few years ago, and the one-minute silence for the September 11 victims was haunting and worthy. As for the awards, New Zealand was totally robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has gone home with four minor awards, while a MINUTE FASHION has marvelously won most of the major awards, except for the best actor who should have gone to a tough guy, New Zealander, but went to an American like All. The only Oscar Awards we've agreed, apart from the Fellowship presented, have been the best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both the right calls.
