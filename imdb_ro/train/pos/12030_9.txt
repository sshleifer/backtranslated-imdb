hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love Twisted Desire and I like to see Melissa Joan Hart on t.v, as I think it is good. I'm a true fan of the Sabrina and the teenage witch, so that helped me keep track of it (do not ask). I like how Nicole intends to kill her parents with a lot of charity, because she assures that someone else pulls the trigger and practice on bottles, so she will not give her fingerprints (a very well planned idea), back I think they all have were injured on nicole, because she was caught when the old boyfriend comes in and puts a hidden camera under her shirt. give this movie a new one out of ten, and put it on my list of top 10 movies. And last but not least, if anyone sees this movie in stores, please tell me how I saw it on TV and did not record it. bye
