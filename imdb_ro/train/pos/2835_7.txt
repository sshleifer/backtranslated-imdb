Acknowledgments should be given to Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that they only pay US $ 1.4 and I could have such a surprisingly delightful pleasure. Adultery? How common in today's modern day. Eve took two children and abducted Nick to pursue Luis and Charlotte in Italy. She wants her revenge done, but at the end she commits the same murder of Luis: having sex with Nick. In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe has dealt with the problems of starvation in modern marriage with a light heart. How can we dare to seriously treat marriage in this time for fast food, where people are now more physically, mentally and technologically mobile? The marital engagement requires too high a price that most people would choose to circumvent. Nick trusted Charlotte, but fell for Eve after that kidnapping trip that forced him to experience a lot of growth. Most viewers can feel satisfied with the end, because Eva and Nick meet, well, this should be the greatest reward for their unbelieving act. However, I want a follow-up, I want to see how the four will evolve after this exchange. Maybe they can change back, how can they be so sure about the unclear love affair. <br /> <br /> Good drive and a good landscape. The two little actors must not be neglected, especially the boy, when they cry at the hotel reception in Venice. And, of course, how can we forget the city's bella, bella.
