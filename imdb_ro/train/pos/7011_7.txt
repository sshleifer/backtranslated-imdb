First, I liked this movie. It was well done by all. However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I did not know anything about this movie, except for some recommendations "I have to see it", but I knew where the plot took place under ten minutes. (I will not mention what cheated me in order not to spoil a good movie for others). Still, despite being obvious, I looked. It was nice to see how he played everything, by completing the details and motivations of the characters in subsequent scenes. I do not hate it when I think it ends earlier in a movie. I just hate it when the resolution road is lined with a boring landscape. Will Smith's person is simple, even when he plays such a troubled person. He is energetic and credible in everything I've seen. Seven Pounds is another great performance. Rosario Dawson is a solid performer portraying a strange, rather optimistic character despite a terminal cardiac state. Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer, and with Rosario, if you do not find it gorgeous, you should think of replacing your eyes. It was nice to see Woody Harrelson on the screen. I have not seen him too much lately, but that could only be me. Woody did not have a huge amount of time on the screen, but he sold his jolly character, piano player, blind man for everything he deserves. Excellent. A short jellyfish research tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonerotic. I think that makes this a questionable choice for both pet and plot. In general, I have to recommend this film not for the plot but for some very good performances and because it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions we generally try to avoid.
