I did not see the movie until I bought the band last year. I was excited and amused. It has all the elements of what I like to see in a Sci-Fi story, in a book or screen. There are social commentaries, speculation and a good story. There is something extraordinary and funny, watching a 1936 vision of the "distant future" of the 1960s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think we need to see, and not just Sci-Fiers.
