La Coda Dello Scorpione (also The Scorpio Tail Case) was watching director Sergio Martino at the wonderful Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is giallo quintessential, presenting all the aspects that the fans of the genre have known and loved. Crossing, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a little gore all come together to make a heck of a piece of Italian exploitation. A group of favorites gialli, both in front and behind the camera, is working to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around. Martino added his touches as director, great genius Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicolai creating music and a series of stars and star giallo such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> With all these talents behind him, Scorpions deliver? You bet. The film works on several different levels. It's an extraordinary murder mystery, a tense and violent film of horror, and a suspense thriller. All in all one of the best gialli around. Martino certainly knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some moments in the film, he almost seems to channel Argento into his approach. For example, there is a direct rupture of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage, where the killer tries to break the door, which actually surpasses Argento's film. Are there problems with the movement? Hmmm ... just minor. First, all scenes that do not follow the killing or the story of enthusiasm between the two causes begin to suffer. But even before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and you will be back in the cradle of things. Also, to the end, breathing becomes a little too bizarre. I mean, what purpose did scorpions really serve? If you do not pay special attention to the dialogue, you can easily lose your twist and weave. But these minor strangles, La Coda Dello Scorpione, are tense, suspenseful, clear and entertaining for giallo fans. Look out!
