Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, there are a number of fans, available only on the web, and it's mainly friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home cameras and sewing machines, as Mickey & Judy once put it upon me. They are definitely friends and neighbors, you can say. Are many of these people not the most beautiful people you've ever seen, or the youngest or the thinnest? are some of them stumbling through their lines like marble walking? some of them have thick accents, or simply do not seem to speak well, first of all, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they say. However, you have to admit, for all these friends and neighbors have put together, it's actually fun to watch. Yes, part of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit strange (though, of course, a little too cool) seeing two Starfleet men kissing (although some of the kiss scenes seem to go further and further). Yes, please a little when you quote clearly from ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme played at the beginning and end of each show. Good. We can get through this. Why? Graphics is the first rate. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes, a show or two really stand out in stories? some of them are actually true tears-jerkers. Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word? but you must provide the credits involved in which the credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to make a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics? is an enormous effort on many parts of people. We look, we turn around and thank them.
