I've already loved "How Christmas Grinch Stole" when he was released and still love him now, 5 years later. Still a lot of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really received much love when it left. Sure, the movie is over and campy, but that at the same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All the sets, costumes and characters are perfect over the head in a fun way without becoming really ridiculous. It's a visually spectacular video to watch. It's a campy movie that does the best! Director Ron Howard really captures this little Christmas movie a little fun. The main reason why the movie works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey as Grinch. He really carries the movie with his good and fun part. He is, of course, helped by the compelling make-up that has also received an Academy Award. Of course, if you're a Jim Carrey murderer, you do not even have to think about watching this movie. This movie is really his film and he does everything working and so fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. The movie has a good moral, but it's a bit tense. Maybe because I'm Dutch and we do not really celebrate Christmas so enthusiastic and great here, like in the United States or England. For me the film was fun and fun, and the morale left me cold enough to be honest. James Horner's musical score is good and fun, even if Horner's average is every day, everything works perfectly for the movie and helps make the work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
