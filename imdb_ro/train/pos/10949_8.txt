First of all, I would like to say that I am a great fan of Sarah Silverman, and other people say that even then the pilot's circle is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, maybe it's not even funny, but the situation and delivery are what matters. If you liked Jesus, it's Magic then I do not see how it's like that. It has the same flow and rhythm. True is true for true fans, but if you are, you will be pleased. Again, for true fans only, there is no way around them. If you are not used to her style then you will not understand why this is fun. However, it is, and I hope you think about it too.
