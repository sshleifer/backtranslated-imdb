I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see this. An intelligent, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not quite sure how a director could create "nothing" but leave Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals from C.O.R.E. to create another set of low budget that looks real (as real as nothing can be). Well, worth the time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You will be glad you did.
