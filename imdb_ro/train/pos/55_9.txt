At first I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came to my guide, so I looked at IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool, so I thought I was going to try to wait a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I passed by the fact that I should not like the character of Alicia played great by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job of this film was about establishing the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so important to Deanna, played by Erika Christensen, almost throughout the movie, but eventually we find out that they, despite being polar opposed, have a thing in common except for being in the movie. They share loneliness and to what extent it reveals itself as the film progresses. I just said how much I liked this movie and I was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I could not go through the elephant because it seemed to exploit the Columbine tragedy. This film, on the other hand, was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips is deactivated CHAIN! This is a good thing and I would like to see progress in some mature roles.
