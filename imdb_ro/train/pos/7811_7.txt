Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority headed by South Africa in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's "Cry Freedom," is not about Biko or apartheid, but about Donald Woods, the editor of the liberal white newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has an offensive exchange of views after Biko dies in jail because of a disturbing behavior from South African police. Woods, played by Kevin Kline, has to choose whether to do the right thing and run away from the country to publish books about Biko or to allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to press him into forgetting about books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard of escaping numbers across borders after Biko's death. Denzel Washington, Oscar nominee, is good in Biko's fourth film, but something is wrong in a movie that attempts to describe apartheid battles by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half of movie. Attenborough had better served his subject by focusing on lifting Biko to prominence instead of starting where Biko became friends with Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2Â½-hour film was not even favorable for the big box office, but the movie was anyway an extraordinary boxing flop. Film policy aside, the movie still has fun and sends a message or two, though, in a PG sanitary. *** 4 stars.
