This movie is undervalued by IMDb. Like many movies, it's not Shawshank. But it is a pretty good, if predictable, dance / personal growth contest. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a kind of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you will love. Judging by the IMDb ratings, I think this movie was approaching the top 250 and was "voted bombarded" with many "1s" as it happens with so many movies that are not about the mob, have no special effects, or include non -alb or non-straight. br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Located primarily in Toronto, the signals are subtle, and some publications may think they are set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the Detroit border city. I liked the music. I liked dancing (but I did not believe it worth 50,000 dollars ... but what I know). The characters were light on the eyes. I agree that the title is shit. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying that words and should have an "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). It's not too much to hate this movie (and to be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it), so I can only assume it's a hate speech for the kind of people in it, and that's sad .
