Leonard Maltin must have watched another movie. (Although I find the Guide to be a valuable resource, please do not take into account his comments on this.) He states that "it starts well and then escapes" when it's really the reverse - "it starts to calm down then catches fire ". The plot is just as simple as it happens. Happy mother, happy father and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach, father trapped in the accident, mom escapes to get help, meets with a dangerous escaped condemned. My mom tries to tear the convicts to help them while Father is waiting and hanging for a loving life. Nice white knife, given by electric shock by Ralph Meeker, suddenly appearing (director, John Sturges, intelligent way to make you blow up) midway as the cunning killer, desperate. Meeker is an unusually flippant and reckless actor (at least here in the classic Kiss Me Deadly) and he happily plucks the keys to the narrative of the film and shortens upside down. His character has a habit of grinning a baby and saying, "Pretty clean, right?" when he is particularly pleased with his mistakes. There is a funny break in action when they get a flat tire and vigorously instructs their hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go." She washes back "Where would I go?" (they are in the middle of nowhere) and he makes sitcom-ishly "Yes, that's right." Rubbing them is a hohot. There are flaws, somewhat ridiculous. There is a scene where the police, who followed Meeker for some time, stopped Stanwyck's car and avoided detecting Meeker resting on her shoulder, as supposedly a loving husband, and pretending to be asleep when doubted. A. It obviously shows a male in this picture and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to fall asleep during a meeting with law enforcement authorities would certainly raise suspicion. Still a robust thriller that builds on an exciting and edifying conclusion. <br /> <br />
