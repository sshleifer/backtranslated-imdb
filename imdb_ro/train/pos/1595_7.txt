While I was enjoying the show, I was expecting something totally different from when I first saw "What I like about you", I was expecting to find something like "Everything" (I'm not sure if it's still happening) but I have to say I like the show and while I do not classify it as a revolutionary show, it's very charming and I like the chemistry among the characters, too (including supporting casting) <br /> I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan on the screen because I really love him in City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's boyfriend in Popular, and while I think it was a good show, I do not like her character in the show because it's not just my tea tea, but she it gets out pretty good
