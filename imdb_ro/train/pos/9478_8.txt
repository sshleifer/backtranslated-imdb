This is a beautiful little movie with a beautiful story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. It's a dramatic story quite interesting, with a love affair in it. The story is said slowly, but this works too well to build. The characters are nice and portrayed beautifully by her actors. Normally, I'm not a big fan of the Asian acting style, but acting in this movie was simply good. Of course, the film is quite different in its approach and style in other genre films produced in the West. In a way, this film is more advanced with its approach than Western films made in the same era. The only desire of the film was that his visual style would have been a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of art film, this film is certainly lacking in a few well-known sequences. This was obviously a rather cheap film and it was quite generic. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this movie from really being distinguished and rising above the genre. But, well, this film is about its story and its well-crafted characters in it. In this sense, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
