It was nice to watch this movie on TCM and watch a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) playing a detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series" series. Back in the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance series, and in this picture, famed veteran actress Mary Astor (Lake Hilda) becomes one of the suspects of a murder / suicide case in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was screwed inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) gave a great support role and was Frank Morgan's brother who appeared in "The Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt Heath) appeared in several of these Vance movies and also gave a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the less likely actor could be the killer. Enjoy a wonderful Classic of the past.
