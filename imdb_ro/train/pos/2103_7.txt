I do not know that "Largo Winch" is a comic book (or is a graphic novel, I really do not know), but I have to admit that, hearing about a movie agent / hero, I expected quite differently than what I actually have. <br /> <br /> While it was surprising to look at the beginning, it was nice to look at this movement. You can never tell where it will happen (some predictions are predictable, but generally, you can never really tell if it's over). More starring performance than the main actor and a very good support distribution make it a good watch. Not as packed action as some could hope or expect for a movie like this, but a very good mix.
