Actually ... this "camcorder" effect is just one effect, one good enough. (you do not know too much about directing a movie, right?), this movie is actually better than the original one, it's the fun to watch, made for television, you do not have to follow any rule. I find it hard to look at number one because of killing the first girl, disturbing. and all the time we are going to Judd Nelson to get away from him, we, like spectators, on his side. I hope one day we can see a third cottage near the lake, but I doubt it. By watching this movie, you can understand the way in which real-world movies are made, as this is a kind of film in a movie. Judd is one of the most frightening villains ever, and he is more realistic, not only makes people fall asleep like other horrors.
