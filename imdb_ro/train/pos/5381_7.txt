For a low-budget movie, this was very good. I've put this much over your average action movie B. Sean and Corinne were featured in this movie and did not seem a little shy. Beware of the houses of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers would take this into consideration, but those who play have deserved so much. <br /> <br /> I look forward to Sean and Corinne's more involvement in the entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very authentic, and Corinne's sexy character was pretty tough at his point. It has been well connected with the action sequences and has been executed with confidence. It was a great idea to throw Billy Zane like a smart witch and witchcraft. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to look. The chemistry between Zane and Sean was pretty good. The sequences of action were not funny and seemed to connect throughout the movie. Of course, there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. In general, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for television. Sean and Corinne did a good job because they are newcomers to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared and the rest of Star Cast Star Star have the chance to also join their bins in the success of entertainment. Final Judgment: *** / ****
