A beautiful film that deeply touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and seeing nothing in this world can really be perfect, it's pretty good. The only meticulous thing to which I subjectively oppose is pushing at certain points in the middle of the story. The actor is also very good, and actors can play with actors very well in large-scale films. The real direction seems to have been well thought out, and the scenario must have been amazing. There are some amazing moments of anticipation and a pretty superb circular composition of the story. The moment when the movie, when the main character touches that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect end of a really shining thread.
