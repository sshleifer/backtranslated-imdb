I'm glad this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of content and style triumph over intermittent light and constant noise. In essence, if you have a short attention or if you do not have the imagination and the opportunity to engage in a literary narrative you will not enjoy this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely done: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of successfully transposing Catherine Storr's novel "Marianne Dreams". An inevitable mission that anyone who saw a movie in a book will undoubtedly know. Casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use actors in a rare way now seen; they indulge in the craft of acting! I know, the actors doing their job and acting instead of resorting to the usual turning of camera lenses, a machine tracking calidoscope, explosions, and fights in the event of a fire that bursts around them is a really rare treatment, but it actually happens at this moment of the movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the end of the reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker and not the tabloid reader powered by a spoon. Apart from a solid scenario, direction and action, it relies on atmosphere, suspense, and implicit horror. If you are to be categorized as a horror, then the presentation of the paper house is rather in Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. In conclusion, if you like a lot of loud noises, blasts, sharp cuts, and bright colors, you'd better look at "Transformers," but if you like a suspense story that runs through a narrative's ability to use, without insulting your intelligence with the force that nurses your nonsense cacophon, thing.
