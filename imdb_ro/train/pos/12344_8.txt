Sea Is Watching was made from an original scenario Akira Kurosawa and is indeed a lush and warm film. Watching will be a pleasure! Kei Kumai as a director is certainly not the same as the old eternal master (especially the massive scenes at the beginning of the movie has a terrible action), but the overall mood and landscape is very enjoyable. Another thing that is missed here: Kurosawa has always succeeded in letting the characters be much more than what they look and do in fact. It was probably his magic in the set during filming; and perhaps this scenario was not fully apparent. not Kurosawa. Wait for this to be very bad ...
