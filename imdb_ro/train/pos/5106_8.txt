I think every time I see one of these 80s old films, I'll be back in a simpler, no matter what it would look like today. This movie is a good one. I remember seeing her as a little kid and I thought it was the biggest movie ever. He has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back, laugh, and still feel sad, but this time I really know what's going on. I found a strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and join Sissy, get married, move in a trailer, have a fall, a tricky, die uncle, and then come back together all within a month? Only in America.
