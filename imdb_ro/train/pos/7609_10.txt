An absolutely brilliant show. The second season started when the first one ended, with many mysteries. Suspicion in most if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can go out with all the connections and bind all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so significant. I never manage to excite and look forward to the new season. We hope that more secrets will be revealed and, at the same time, more mystery will be solved. A good distribution selection for this show perfectly matches the characters. Indeed, I can not wait to discover the secret. We hope the whole hype will not hurt the end.
