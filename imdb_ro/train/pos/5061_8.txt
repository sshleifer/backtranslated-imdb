it's worth looking, especially with a beautiful turn of a journalist with integrity, you expect a story line where Gray Owl is exposed as a fraud, but it is not and does not add to the theme and drama, generally optimistic and elevating story and film. This must be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convincingly admirably as an English boy playing Indians. The remarkable scene is the return to his aunt? where Brosnan and the two elderly actresses make a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and a lost life with so little dialogue, only with good expressions and directions. Perfect. The story is so little known, and the message so universal and all important is a real pity that this film has not received better recognition, maybe over time it would become a little classic and cross. I hope yes. Well done Dickie Attenborough and poured.
