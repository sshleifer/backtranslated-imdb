"One-Minute Hate" is undoubtedly one of the best movies that has come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it is a brilliant film by any means, but it certainly deserves a watch. "Hate" chronicles the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a child abused before, and begins to listen to his bad side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very visually beautiful. The photos are creative, and the lighting is appropriate and interesting to look at. This film actually has a production value for him, unlike other recent versions of Michigan such as Dark Tomorrow and Biker Zombies. Dolly's subtle images and stylized wrinkled composition show a good use of this $ 350,000 budget. However, "Hatred" is hampered in the same places as so many other local movies do, and that's in the stories and characters department. Essentially, things happen very well. Eric Seaver is not evolving at all. Practically, he was always crazy, but people start to notice. The film wanders along its cheerful, very little path. The end is also very steep. However - since this is a horror movie, since we care about the plot? We only want to see people die and that "Hurray" definitely offers. As the number of bodies was assembled, the people in the theater began to smile "Kill them! Kill them all!" When people scream back on the screen, it's always fun. This is the place where "Hate" succeeds. It's fun. And finally, that's all that matters.
