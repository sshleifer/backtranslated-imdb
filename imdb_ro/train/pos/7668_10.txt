I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely awesome in this. Play the role of the modern wizard at the handle. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The film helped inspire a role-playing game that I enjoy, Mage: Awakening. I showed her at various LARP parties, and it's always a great success. D & D love and Jeff-squeezing aside is not even a masterpiece, but it's well done and completely enjoyable. Complot moves quickly and feels in simplicity, the special effects are good enough for such a low budget, and the scenario, while nothing stellar, has not been done too badly and has not been done in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
