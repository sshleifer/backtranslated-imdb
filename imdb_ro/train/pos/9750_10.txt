Yeah, Giorgio, it's a good movie. A little love story, wonderful music, beautiful scenery, a comedy (a great fight of food) and a bitter bitterness are the ingredients of Da, Giorgio. Any film director will enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a brief escape from time to time and how well do we do this than a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? I need to see!
