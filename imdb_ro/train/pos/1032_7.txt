A message movie, but a good one. Remarkable top-down distribution. Interestingly, Bette Davis's plot line is basically the back story! Extremely negative comments (the name that casts the script / playwright, associating this with extremely negative comments about "Angles in America", etc.) are opposed to the film being too preoccupied with Germany during the Second World War. God, this is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me. Theater and film, acting styles vary over time and, of course, 70 years later this movie will not be done here. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but although done the same year and both of them having Nazis in them, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The love story of this film takes second place in the spy - more than a thriller. Both have a fairly large number of strange accents and wonderful characters. The kids are a little tired and could have been edited
