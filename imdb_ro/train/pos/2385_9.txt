In the old audio cassette publication, the tagline was "Is it real or is Memorex?" The same can be said about the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of Cage, Star Trek's first pilot. Mister. Spock cleverly commanded the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Capt. Christopher Pike, the first captain who was burned and paralyzed, would come back there. Why Completion? Because having any contact with Talos IV calls for a death sentence. Why this is never explained - which has bothered me enormously - but, if nothing else, adds to the story. After arriving at Talos IV, Mr. Spock returned to Dr. McCoy (the eldest officer officer, Captain Kirk left the ship) for arrest and said, "The charge is riot, Dr." I did not receive the order takeover of the ship. "The following is a Martian court in which - because of the Talosians - we find out why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) that Captain Pike should reach Talos IV even at the risk of Mr Spock's death. which the Talosians create, the background music and the whole story are fantastic, and Meg Wyllie as the Master (the Talosian head) is wonderful, call me sexist, but I never realized I had a woman in this role, but she Talosians, giving up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex, you can not really say whether they are men or women and it does not matter at all. like almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds there and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a nice thing, if it were so! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on the video), I never fascinate myself. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien, and I do not want to say that amazing.
