A true dark movie and a very graphic film, a beautiful story of a man who is watching the redemption that just left him too late. From a visual point of view, there are some very beautiful stunning artistic scenes of what can be done with a minimal budget. The size of Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although we hope that more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray showed wonderful that she had never seen her before and hoped to see her again in the future. The topic of all interesting Sex, Drugs and Violence. Bring it. I would say for sure that you rent it and check it out for a semi-moody noir.
