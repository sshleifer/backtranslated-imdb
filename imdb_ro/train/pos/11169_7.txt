when I saw the movie at first, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all scary things began to happen as when the church dies and is brought back to life, and also gage and his mother dies and there the idiot father must bring them back to life, even if he warned them and ignores Jud.this is not Steven Kings's best work. I thought his best work was brilliant. I do not think the people who see this movie and commenting on how terrible it was, are wrong because everything they think is what they thought. as if that person can do a better job doing a horror hit. That is, doing evil and killing Judas is a genius. making the most innocent character the most innocent in one of the murderers is cool. people who do not like the movie are stupid, because everything is a scary movie and nothing else. do not expect anything from a movie that is not. Still in a general area it was not that good. they still recommend people to watch the movie
