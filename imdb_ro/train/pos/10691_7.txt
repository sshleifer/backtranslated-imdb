I caught these last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia in three different times (by adopting the two children). I can not put my finger exactly why I liked this movie apart from seeing "bad" turn, "good" and "good" turn, "semi-bad". I liked the look that Ben Chaplin has in the whole movie. Like "I can not believe this happens to me", be it good or bad that has the same look (and works). The big end. 7/10. Hire it or catch it on the ship like me.
