Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie and I guarantee you that you decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and over that period there was not a moment when I was not laughing. You'll laugh a few hours after it's over, resuming kick lines over and over and in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many fun shows during his career (48 hours, trading places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, coming to America, Professor Nutre, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far the strangest. I've seen this movie so many times and it's funnier every time. He never loses his edge. Starting this day before, each extraordinary show will be emulated from Delirious. ***** and two fingers!
