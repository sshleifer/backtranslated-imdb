Fear it as Beckham is full of interesting scenes, but it has a predictable general line. This is a girl called Jess who is trying to reach his long-lasting dream to become a famous football player and finally gets the chance when he offered a local team position. there are so many limits and boundaries that I'm holding back, but she's still determined and striving. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a beautiful light film and wants to be inspired by what people can do. The song options are very good, "move my baby, just move ... to the destination and make boundaries and complications." However, the hope was to help your needs in a review. Bend it like she did Beckham
