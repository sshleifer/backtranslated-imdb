I liked the fact that this film recognizes the spectator's intelligence, allowing the layers to detach themselves from the characters by interacting with each other about the unspoken loss that has affected them so much. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of a man I think is a new talented, mature and artistic director to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed achieve. I see a brilliant future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on a goal and to achieve it with integrity. Kudos for this achievement.
