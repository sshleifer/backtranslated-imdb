First of all, I would like to make a correction to another review of this film that said the last Oscar-winner Best Picture was "Gigi" in 1958. This is misinformation as "West Side Story" won in 1962, "My Fair Lady" won in 1965, and "Sound of Music" won the following year. That being said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story in the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations they have had on a scene they have not changed for a filmed version. However, I do not mind. Actually, I rather think that the whole production flows better than the novel does. She likes Nancy to bring Oliver to the bridge with her and be killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are what make me laugh. I like the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start out of the governors' office. The emphasis for that moment is brilliant. The three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is made much better than he is in the book) and Shani Wallis, the most powerful version of Nancy. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of 10 is because of the two large production numbers that are "Concider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy". I always hate when choreography in musicals means to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. It looks awful and cheese, especially when dancing at London Meat Co. She would have to do regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will remain with us, hopefully forever.
