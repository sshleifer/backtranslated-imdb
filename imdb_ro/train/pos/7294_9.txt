After reading a few comments, I felt I had to add the two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I've ever seen. I had the opportunity to see this at the Independent Film Festival in New York. I felt this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short period of time. The story focuses on a young woman who is the victim of her abusive father. Soon he gave him the chance to "stop him" by a demon played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". Following the show, I was impressed by the way he played a unique and different character. I did not know he could behave so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very convincing. The act was absolutely gorgeous by him. The little girl was fine and my father was decent. There is also death in this thing that follows the girl around her until she is able to escape from her future. Effects and cinema have completely breathed. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budgets for that. It's rare to meet briefly. The opening was absolutely breathtaking compared to any feature film. This does not mean that he is not without his defects - I thought he had a little to go and the intro was a bit long. But this has remained to me the day after I saw him. There are very few shorts with this quality level.
