Wow, it's been years since I saw the last movie. His watching in 2008 is certainly different from watching him in 1986. Initially, I did not think I would do it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unpleasant, arrogant and disrespectful that it was hard for me to see. He embraced all the negative stereotypes of the Americans. If it was not bad enough, once the best American workers were shown, the picture got worse. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were presented as robot laborers without excitement. The movie was not that funny, I only hanged there because of its nostalgic value. And I'm glad I went on the clock. Like boxing, judges are influenced by how you finish the round. This movie went from about three to seven that we evaluated because of the end. The end was excellent. You ever want a harmonious ending, and that was just that. It was great that the city had to keep jobs and keep the factory, but the most marvelous was the marriage of Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre film that ended with a high note.
