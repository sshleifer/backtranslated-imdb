After I became completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would ever be another show approaching to be as good as this show. I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding! I really enjoy this show and I can not stop it. The richness of the characters, the complications of the plot, the beautiful decoration are all amazing. I am completely and fully engaged. I do not know how the creators do, but every character touches me deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, to me! I have no cable, so I rented the series on Netflix. When I put it all, I look at all the episodes and I feel sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next disc to come to my house. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen!
