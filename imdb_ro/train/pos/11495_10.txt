I saw this at one of the local cinema cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, TX. It was a total surprise compared to writing in the theater bulletin, but both of us were rejected by art. It was beautifully made and (apparently) photographed in a Schloss (German for Château) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twenty men and women isolated from daily constraints. It's fantastic on many levels than I remember. I came home after the movie and I talked and talked until 4:00 in the morning. The version we saw was in English (most of the time), so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in the original German version. I searched and searched for a video tape version, but I never found anything. It would be absolutely the pleasure of having a VHS or DVD version of this. Exploring relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, please persuade him to release him again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine getting tired of watching the honest performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties. Please bring it back.
