New York playwright Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 and fades fast; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's most recent plays on Broadway. TV reviewers have fun at Caine and get drunk. Crossing the Long Island Railroad field to Montauk instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally, when he gets home, Caine is comforted by his wife atyed Dyan Cannon (like Myra), a patient in the heart, unfortunately, tall. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap," written by the terrible young man, Christopher Reeve (Clifford Cliff Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple thinks Mr Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the success he needs to revive Caine's career. "The trap is set for an amusing evil that will do". <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long shot from Broadway does not move too far from the stage. The distribution is pleasant and the breath of the story is still delightful. One thing that did not work (for me) was the end of the curtain call; certainly played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to look again; the shows have died but, unfortunately, the greeting that Reeve gave to Caine at East Hampton Station should have been simplified to a "Hello" smile. The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. And the scene of love is very shocking. But the play was so good, "even a talented director could not ruin him." And Mr. Lumet is not disappointed. ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
