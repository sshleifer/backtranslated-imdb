An excellent movie that deals with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Starting with 1910, he recalls his boy and adulthood; family, friends, romance, etc. The very nostalgic song with a bitter end ... "all the things in life meet as one, and a river passes through it and that river haunts me." Worth seeing.
