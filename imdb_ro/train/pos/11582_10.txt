For someone who remembers Jane in Daily Mirror cartoons, watching this film is a nostalgic exercise. In this context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the lack of comedy and lack the point where the actors are cartoon characters. The plot line is also a bit limp for today's audience, but it reflects the naivety of the 1940s and '50s very well. Jane, you have to remember, it was part of the escapist fantasy of the years of war, designed to boost the morale of the troops. It has given a double-meaning "strip" in cartoons. The story has something to do with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been something familiar to the readers of that era, a bunch of nazi stutters wounded by a few bisexual British who were in the African jungle, of course. see. For the others, a wet car. <br /> <br />
