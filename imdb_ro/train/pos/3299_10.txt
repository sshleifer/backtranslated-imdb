A wonderful movie that requires a taste. If you're in action, wham movies and hate serious love stories then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a smart good movie, I recommend this a great deal. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian movie I'd give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then comes second at this masterpiece.
