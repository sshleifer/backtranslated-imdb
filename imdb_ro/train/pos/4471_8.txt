Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi starring in "Anchors Aweigh," directed by George Sidney. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two marines at Hollywood holidays. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and, taking him home, meet with his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. He wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is a stir. This is a very energetic musical with dances and great songs by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly gets to dance with Jerry Mouse in a delightful succession. Grayson plays Jalousie and my heart sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. Sinatra shows its versatility and why the girls have grasped it with those big blue eyes and the boy's face. For Kelly, this was a major break for him at MGM. Lovely, very lively movie.
