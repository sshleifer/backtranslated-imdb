I have just been presented at the film "Expresion en Corto", a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film was rolled from the first shot, I was amazed: a long continuous blow of futuristic Paris in glorious white and black. I did not have to keep on the details because I think it's a movie worth seeing. The science fiction story could be found average for many ... for me it was very good. The action is great, the room is free to fly all over and I mean everywhere. Things you could not do or see is done nicely. The performance expressed is good, in my opinion, no one hits the wrong note. Now, what I found wonderful is the animation. 3D graphic shows 2D. A BW comic book brought to life. Background details give more texture as if it were made by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angles change, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The screening maker spoke about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but maybe she was quite inexperienced because she had only a short film in her resume. So many people had true faith in them. They started their own studio from scratch and when they faced the challenge they brought to them. Do not miss. I think you will not regret ... maybe Richard Linklater because the final aspect of this movie is superior to the one that I believe.
