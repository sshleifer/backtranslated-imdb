Let me do a clear thing ... for the most part, the mentality of those who lead the Hollywood show tells me frankly, in general, and even more precisely, about the treatment of the loved and iconic characters in book pages comics. Why? Well, let's take a typical meeting scenario of the Hollywood Executive Council to illustrate if we ... Executive # 1 'Hey, there are dollars to be collected from superhero movies nowadays '. <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'Good point, let's do one rush! ?? We'll make a lucky drop in a hat and we'll pick a randomly-played superhero to rely on a movie! (Drop takes place and a name of famous superhero is removed) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Wonderful! Now who can play the role? <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 'Who is a big box office right now?' <br /> <br /> Executive No. 1 * * Actor's Name * is the thing this week. ' <br /> <br /> Executive # 2 'But does not really fit the role? I mean, it does not look like the character. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Who cares ?! It is a great name; Anyway we're gonna make the movie with him. <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'You're right! And besides, we will fill the whole movie so full of special glitz effects to postpone the moronic masses that no one ever will ever question! "The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons why, in general, it links the most modern superheroic films." All style, no substance and simply pathetic casting lead iconicly. "Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule, when Hollywood is right to take original casting (and yet very easy!) by Superman, Christopher Reeve, and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. back to the general negative features displayed by Hollywood today? .. would not it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually fit the roles? Well, in this less than ideal world, a director does not believe or not that, throwing actors based on their true resemblance to their comic book counterparts, whose name is Sandy Collora, but unfortunately Hollywood has not yet let Collora dir a long-haired film, but fortunately for us, he gave us some attempts to show how the final result would be in the form of two (still) superhero short features. One is the brilliant Batman: End Dead, and the other is this mystical trailer for a completely fictional film called Worlds Finest. Do not weep your words here? this is absolutely awesome! The distribution of the Universe winner and the male model Michael O'Hearn (which looked just as wonderful but was totally squandered in the unclear barbar) makes the most perfect choice to play the iconic steel man. In fact, from the point of view of physical resemblance, there was no doubt a closer approach to comic character. Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrait as Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, another extremely judicious piece of casting! What can I say? ?? If only this was really a real, long-lasting movie! Hollywood Studio Directors? get your notes! This is how it should be done! As a final note, I am again intrigued by the very divided reactions this short film evoked from the fans. Saying that the strongest and most vehement side-effects against her clearly came out (as in the case of Batman: Dead End) from a younger and less cinematic audience; a fact betrayed by their primitive grammatical graces and the liberal use of the basic diction. Such an unhappy closed-minded state is indeed a sad phenomenon, even if one of our previously mentioned Hollywood studio directors will undoubtedly have great satisfaction. After all, these same deceived individuals are probably exactly the same type of imbecile dressed in CGI, popcorn, who walks in most of the crap that Hollywood does through the flood of today.
