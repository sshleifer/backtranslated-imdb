This is a comedy as it once was and comparing it with the two remakes, THE MONEY BREAK and WE ARE GIVEN ?, it just shows how the 40 filmmakers have a comedy talent that , unfortunately, was lost. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I first saw this and even at that early age it was a lot of laughter. Now, of course, they are familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see a whole crowd that I lost as a youth. The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... have interacted perfectly, but the core of the film lies in the frustrations encountered in making a dream. It is never so easy and unseen complications, as we imagine. Generally, this is a classic comedy that is still above attempts to remake it.
