Kubrick once again sets his stunning capability to create a perfect ambience for a movie. Mainly, through cinema, but also by using an ingenious score, he creates a hoarse and threatening tone that is on the whole movie and causes me to deceive the spine from the beginning. It is indeed this impeccable atmosphere that makes Glowing a masterpiece in my eyes. Of course it does not hurt Jack Nicholson to give one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. A frightening portrayal of a mad mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial to be beautiful, but it's easy to look after the two when the rest of the movie is so bright. In addition, he presents the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
