I've been watching this document twice - and though I'm a big film, most documentaries do not attract my attention. This movie was fascinating. Almost every film is perfect - saying much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have). The concept of this film is amazing, I can not boast enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought? <br /> <br /> The amazing and excellent choice of interviews - the movie of a Chinese factory - the movie makes you feel like you are there. I'm politically conscious - and I've "read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this movie that was a surprise to me. However, it makes me think so much." <br /> < br /> I want so much that this world is a better place. One million kudos for the director - and thank you for making this movie too. <br /> </ p> <p> I want everybody to see .
