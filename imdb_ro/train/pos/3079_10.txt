While listening to an audio book, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear my voice and that made me disappointed that "Six Degrees" was canceled. He never keeps good shows on air enough to capture an audience that can connect to the story of the show. What a shame and shame in the network not to give this show a chance full of seasons. It was an excellent show to watch with great distribution. The network gave "Men in Trees," a second chance of a witch, also a great show, but they took "Invasion" and that was something else to follow, not the same old old themes. Why networks are wrong.
