I also came back from Redeye's advanced examination and I have to say I did not have a lot of fun on a long time. WES CRAVEN is the best at all. It brings us a wonderful end to the summer thriller, I was so desperate for the lust. This is the thriller of the year. No doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X were great. Constant suspense was built. I was at the edge of my chair most of the movie. It's been a while since I heard an audience and I was beaten and excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for creeps, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE delivers. Go see!
