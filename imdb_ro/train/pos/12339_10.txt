He loved Joan. Excellent performance. Which is not good. I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre right after ... she's getting better. My heart was straightening. Old old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions deserve the whole movie. I'm glad I got it on the video. I do not know what you need in a movie. Beautiful woman .... fortune ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very beautiful. It makes me wonder what budget it was for this movie? They still want to make such movies. Whenever they try, they seem to make a cheesy movie. Black and white films still keep a certain mystery.
