Probably the first Portuguese film I've ever seen in my life and I liked it. The story is related to how the young army officers took over power in Portugal in 1974 to ultimately defeat the Caetano fascist government and complete the wars in the colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola and Bissau - Cape Vert . Most of the events presented in the film accurately reflect the behavior of officers and soldiers of the army to lead the coup, the oppressed people, who was very pleased with this new development and the freedom, resistance of Caetano's people, and also a subtle way of the most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took office as the new president. The Portuguese Revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but to me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop democratically and that was what the country has achieved a few years after this coup d'Ã©tat or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the fastest enemies have been respected at the end.
