This - and not a slightly overestimated Southern soap opera - was the biggest epic that came out of the biggest year of the year, 1939. I will not play the obvious - Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was the Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. offer comic shows. However, I want to observe two less understood elements of this masterpiece. Ultimate magic battle success, as the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs up to the top of the temple to throw his spear and warns the regiment, is simply great. She never gets horrified. Another element underrated in the film is the performance of Eduardo Ciannelli as a Guru. This is not a Fu Manchu caricature, but a well-drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander the Great") bastard. Indeed, one can see the parallels between this mystic nationalist and the evil one and a well-known figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, the anti-Nazi tract? Not realy. But still, an extraordinary, funny, moving epic.
