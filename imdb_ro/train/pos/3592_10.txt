Another strong move. This time, she turns around Diana Gusman, who always enters school battles. Instead of being expelled, he takes his anger elsewhere at the boxing ring. She trains to be a boxer and there meets Adrian fever and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a strong message of getting your dreams and going with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, her father does not believe in her). That makes the movie worth the price. enjoy
