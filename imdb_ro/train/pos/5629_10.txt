I liked this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played the phenomenal and heart-breaking role. She plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect her and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being dismissed by the police, she realizes she's on her own. One day, when she is just home, the stranger enters the house and attacks her again. It's not about calling the police or taking it out, being forced to spray it in the eye and lock it in the fireplace. I think it takes a wake-up call to the earth laws. I'm too easy for these criminals. It is time for tougher punishment.
