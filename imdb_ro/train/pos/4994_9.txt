Man's Castle is a great example of a pre-code movie. This involves realistic events with genuinely pleasant and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul with no money in his pocket. He makes a living doing strange jobs and travels to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One evening she meets Trina, a beauty of any standard that is cold and lonely. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she did not eat for a few days, but the two are doing very well and forming a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even if they live in a boat by the river. Tracy is one of the great actors in the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relational. We can see his thoughts on his face, making it easy to identify, even if we think he is acting badly. Young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from being perfect, making her so enjoyable. Pre-coding elements include thin sinking, pregnancy before marriage, and murder.
