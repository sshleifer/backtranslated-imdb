Excellent show. Instead of following the same old sitcom, it shows where the same old thing is, just different "stars," this refreshing show offers an incredibly entertaining view of office situations. We have been away from watching any TV for 2 years and after coming back from all the available shows, we look forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global to unplug the connector. I thought it would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, FEW CANADIAN SHOWS do it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show, and I think it was crazy for Global to leave. I think they want to remove it from the typical states of the States, instead of shooting behind a Canadian show that has had a lot of promises. Do not misunderstand me, I like a lot of TV show, but, let's go, keep the variety. This unique show has provided a very comic view of a realistic, a little exaggerated part of working life and relationships, with unique characters you do not see in any sitcom today or in the past. Too bad the globe had to say no to this, a bad mistake.
