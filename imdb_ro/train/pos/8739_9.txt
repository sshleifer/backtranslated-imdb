This is a FUNNY movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, a wide range of characters, story, attractiveness) combined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of lesser-known actors such as Antz and Price of Egypt. /> <br /> <br /> Characters work very well and have a strong attraction, and humor is directed to a broad level that goes beyond generational barriers. The film is also presented in superb cinematic format, which adds cinematic experience. Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times and I intend to give more friends to see this weekend. Many skeptics saw this movie on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one ever left this film without a sense of satisfaction. See this and do not be delayed because it's animated. Are you sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! Bloopers and the out-of-the-end are the funniest part of the movie that is full of laughter all the time.
