some people think the second series was where Scooby was ruined .. I totally disagree. the quality looks did not go up or down and scrappy, win my opinion as a very good chrecter. I looked at a survey on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the scrappys second series was scoobys downfall. Ok so the uploads said yes, but 28% still can not be wrong. I like how most of the episodes focused on comedy.i think the show would have gone garbage if it was the same 5 people / dog solving of the mystery in the same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air at the show.sure, some people tuned out but when it was introduced scrappy views DOUBLED figures. Looks at the show.All episodes and segments were very funny I was intrigued shorts yabba and pants. But at the end of the day, a matter of opinion whether you like it or not is a matter of opinion, certainly there is no fact involved. But in my opinion this was a splendid series that gave a start to tires showing a new formula and rental life.
