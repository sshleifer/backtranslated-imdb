The book on which this film is based was excellent; it took me a while to deal with Houellebecq's unconventional style, but once I understood the mood behind the writing, I was completely attracted to the writer's sadness. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has elucidated my own personal struggle and made it hard for me to accept the futility of my struggle. Houellebecq's interests are captured by Harel, and the apathy and indifference of the hero to a world that rejected him is perfectly portrayed. This is a film that reveals today's society to the inferior man in all horror. We hope that things will change in the future, but for now we have to accept the rat race as shown in this film. Probably Harel or Houellebecq does not again create a genius like this. One is enough for any man.
