This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first years as a monarch of Great Britain. "The Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated for immaculate details. The extravagant costumes, generous locations and beautifully landscaped gardens make the "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most amazed at the careful cinema. The way each person is placed in relation to the background or the foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that hit me most was when Victoria talked to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame at Victoria's Point, and from Melbourne's point of view, Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne held her arm on her hips. Story Story is too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have been hurried or even not explained. I waited for a large crown scene and, disappointingly, lasted only a few seconds. In general, "The Young Victoria" is a good film and it would have been even better if it had been longer, so events could be properly explained without hurrying.
