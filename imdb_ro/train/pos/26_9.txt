When I was a child, I followed this many times, and I often remember the whistle of "Happy Cat". All the songs are wonderful and, in fact, memorable, unlike the musicals of many children, where the songs are just blocked for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are generous and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising given the distribution. Christopher Walken is very similar to cats and does not need silly makeup or a cat costume for the spectator to think he's a human-made cat. And Jason Connery is as cute as the son of the mortar, shy and uncomfortable, Corin, who falls in love with the handsome and brave Princess Vera. This is a fun, long-lasting, funny film where, unlike most fairy tales, characters are given to characters. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin claim to drown; to the ball when everyone starts dancing a country dance because it's "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table (and he's a fairly good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she was doing when she was young, as if she had pretended to be a miller's daughter. I would recommend this film to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And it's actually a movie that you can watch together because it will not lead the adults up the wall.
