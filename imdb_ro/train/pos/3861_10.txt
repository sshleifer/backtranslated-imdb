2 WORDS: The Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the biggest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The actor was the pinnacle of any independent film. Jeremy Earl has been in the form of a much-seen peak since joining the Joan Cusack Show concert. His lines were executed precisely with dynamite and with a smile, seen last time in a young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next appearance of a young Denzel Washington, when the line "My Bus Is It ... Gone." That was the real turning point of the movie. My grandmothers loved me very much that I bought her DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears of eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white bond between Tony Donato and African-American Nathan Davis. Thick (knotted) and thin (Nathan offering Tony's advice on women), the new dynamic duo has arrived and will come out to conquer Hollywood.
