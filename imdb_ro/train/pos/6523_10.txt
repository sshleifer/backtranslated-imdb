Of course, the history of this film was "hollywoodized" - but it is far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte confronted the Americans because he considered himself French and therefore hates the British not because of a sense of patriotism for a nation that has taken over New Orleans only now; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which led to Galveston's navigation; he was more of a small and villainous killer than a hero * or * a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is a fun movie - and we are confronted with it, we all wanted Jean to go rather cute than the governor's wise daughter. Brynner rises again over the mediocre writing to deliver fascinating performance.
