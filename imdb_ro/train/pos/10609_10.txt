I saw the movie last night on the cable and it's great. What I like the most is that it is undervalued and low key, but deeply honest. Henry Thomas "(he played the baby in ET) performance is amazing (should be a man with a few words.) David Straithern is a wonderful crazy madman and miraculously (given that we are talking about a product of at Hollywood here), a child serves as the main character, but one that does not act or has no lines, but rather IS (and it is bright on it.) Interestingly, the mysterious relationship of Thomas w. ET was the nucleus that film, while the connection of w. the child serves as the core of a "good baby." Then there is music - ah, what music! It's great for the atmosphere. I recommend it a lot.
