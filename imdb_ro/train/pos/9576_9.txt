One of the most nihilist and brutal movies I've ever seen, but one of the most tragic and fastest. This is an action-melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes the plot approached me with tears, while the following moment gave me some shocking revelations, such as a bruise of cracks for courage. Cool performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK-Cop and a Cambodian killer who hunt each other down, losing his humanity, is a strong one. Featuring a very small dialogue in favor of haunting pictures and filming, "Dog Dog Bite" is pure HK-Bloodshed without heroism.
