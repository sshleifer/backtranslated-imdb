Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed with it? and yet it's not easy to explain why I liked it so much. Does this especially apply to unusual movies? those hard to compare with the rest there. Good night Mr. Tom is one of these special films. Is there a lot of emotion in that movie? and the act was so good that, while watching the movie, I was crying and laughing as the story continued. Young Nick Robinson? is a young boy (William) evacuated from London because of air strikes there during the Second World War. Tom Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man who goes to the village where the evicted children were sent. At first, Tom refuses to take on responsibilities - such as caring for a troubled young man? but he accepts, because he is left without a choice. During my stay, Mr. Tom discovers how horrible the life was for William? along with his luggage, did his mother send a belt and written instructions to her son's host? do not hesitate to use it. This belt is enlarged in the field? never be used in such a brutal manner. Mr. Tom offers a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, going to school, making new friends, and discovering hidden talents. Suddenly a William letter is called home in London with a letter stating that it does not feel good and starts again? only this time gets worse? Are there many feelings you can feel in this movie? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable only to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? if it is comparable. I was really glad to look at her and recommend her. Before finalizing this review, I would also like to mention Thomas Orange's great performance in the role of Zac? reminded me of a friend of mine since childhood (:
