"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A tragicomedy with very profound implications on the fate of mankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very simple and ordinary people in a Serbian province abandoned by God just before the start of World War II. I saw it in a small Russian cinema, where the film had a very limited distribution and since then I have had no chance to know it. It is a pity that this excellent movie is almost forgotten now. I've searched for a VHS or DVD copy several times, and unfortunately I did not find anything. I would be very grateful to the other fans of this little jewel of movies to suggest ways to buy a copy.
