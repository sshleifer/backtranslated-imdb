A French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), depressed alone, on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (superstar Stephane Rideau). Quietly and slowly this movie is very frustrating. On the one hand, I was absorbed by her and I really felt for the two boys. On the other hand, I was annoyed - the film continues to blink from the past to the present without rhymes or motives. It is very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also tons of plot holes - Mathieu, at some point, doing something that ends him in the hospital. What it is - I never said! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he lives with him. Why? We are not told. Then he loads inexplicably with another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu living in the same city ... Still, it is a tribute to the movie that you care a lot about the characters. If only things were explained! Elkaim like Mathieu is not good. She is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but she can not act. His idea of ​​acting is set around with an unseen look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. She is very beautiful, she has a very beautiful body and she's a hell of an actor. He also has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is complete masculine nudity, a lot of kisses and a sexually explicit scene in the movie that's great - most movies are shy about showing male-male love scenes. This is not and helps you see how the characters look after each other and feel for each other. So, a frustrating, but worthwhile film - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - that's why you like young young beautiful nudes!
