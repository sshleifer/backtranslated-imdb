Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this example of love and brotherly engagement. Hulce interprets Dominick (Nicky), a poorly mentally handicapped young man who puts his younger brother, Liotta, playing Eugene through his medical school in 12 minutes. She is established in Baltimore and deals with the issues of brother rivalry, the intimidation of twins, the abuse of children, and the good that always earns the worst. It is captivating, full of laughter and tears. If you have not seen this movie yet, please rent it, I promise you, you will be amazed at how such a wonderful movie could become unnoticed.
