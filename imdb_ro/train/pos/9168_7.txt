this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem I had was that I did not like the Clarke Zela. I thought she was too old and made Jane look very shy. in Jane's book it seemed a much stronger character. I was very annoyed by this portrait of her. the part that is the morning after Rochester asks him to marry him and she approaches him and always embraces him makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice to throw. but Dalton was absolutely awesome as Rochester. makes this version of Jane Eyre visible. another thing that made this version is not 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the eighties for television. if it were a feature film and a better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint is that Zela Clarke was certainly too old.
