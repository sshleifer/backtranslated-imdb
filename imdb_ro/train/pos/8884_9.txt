I really liked the 1960s. Without being from that generation (I expect for "The 80's"), it was interesting to see a four-hour single capsule for that era. A major problem in the film was, however, how unbalanced the film was in portraying families. According to the promise I saw for the NBC movie, the story was basically about two families facing problems in America since 1960. Now I think I lost something, but I think I learned more about the white family than about the African-American family. I really think the 1960s use music to describe scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors (all of whom are very talented). This is very noticeable at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the mini-series. Very good movie!
