EA has shown us that I can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 1960s. The graphics of the game are remarkable, and the voice recording is very professional. I received this game in April 2007 (two years after launch), and I am still impressed by the gameplay. It's a shame that EA will not play 007 games. I gave this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game for anyone from the age of 13 and over. The only thing I did not like at the game is the Russian level of the boat, there was too much pressure. Overall I like the game A LOT !!
