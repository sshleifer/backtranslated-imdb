I wanted to see this because my lord and I had nothing else to do on a Sunday afternoon. I like movies that deal with disturbing characters, lost and that's full of em. After a slow start, we have some good changes from the cast, but "Bellini" is the one that does both and let the movie go down. "Bellini" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time, but it's too short and could have made this masterpiece in general 71/2 of 10
