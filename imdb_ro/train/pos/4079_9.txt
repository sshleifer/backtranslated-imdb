I saw the first movie when I was eight years old on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: Flying Island"). I liked it absolutely and it was defeated when it was repeated a little later and I missed it. We were delighted by the story and the characters, but especially the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English version I saw - sometimes erroneously called "Streamline Dub" (Dub was in fact Ghibli itself and only distributed by Streamline), which unfortunately is only available as part of a ridiculous laser disc expensive box-set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel the launch has been partially paralyzed by Disney. The voice works well, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as the "double" oak or the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek seems too old to play the lead role. They made some unnecessary changes, such as changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added a dialogue. But the worst of all I felt they ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the aircraft opening scene, for example, was initially silent, but was spoiled due to Disney's moronic requirement to play music whenever Someone does not talk annoyingly in many Disney movies. This movie still beats away the latest animation movies, and I can not recommend it pretty much. The plot is simple but captivating, and the film presents a flair that, unfortunately, lacks the most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.
