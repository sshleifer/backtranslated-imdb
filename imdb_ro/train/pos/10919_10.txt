Five Deadly Venoms are not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but they feature some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in the history of Hong Kong film. Chang Cheh's director creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece. This film has launched the careers of the five men playing the venom. Meng Lo is still playing a bad game. He will move on to Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, will go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any hammer fan can do this. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninja (also made by Chang Cheh). But everything is very good and is one of the best.
