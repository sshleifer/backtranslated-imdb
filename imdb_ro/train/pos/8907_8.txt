I saw the movie at midnight at On Demand last night, not knowing what to expect. I've heard about this movie, but I never have any opinion about it. I have to say that I was impressed with what I saw. I was really angry in some parts and I definitely remember jumping into my chair several times. Blob was scary looking. Now, I look in a jelly jar and I wonder if it will be left in my hand. Steve McQueen was very good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the movie. I also liked the old man at first. For a horror film of 50 years, this has been well done even by current standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
