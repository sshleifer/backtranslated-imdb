This early Sirk melody, shot in black and white, is a minor film, but at the same time shows the German director's flair in improving tedious lines in something akin to art. Situated in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who has sinned abandoning her husband and her family in the small town to attract the Chicago scene. She did not fulfill her ambitions and was returned to the city she left with a wishful letter from her daughter, informing her that she also preferred the theater (a high school production). Back in her old town, she faces once again her lack of spirit and has her biggest, hostile (and dull) daughter (Richard Carlson) and ex-girlfriend. The story is nothing new, but Sirk is distancing himself by creating meaningful compositions, each frame being carefully shot and helped by the fact that Stanwyck has a young lady. It has a hardness of 76 minutes, and that's just as good, because the material does not have the feet to go any further.
