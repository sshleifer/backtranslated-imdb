The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it does not really fit into the genre of movies that came from the early 1990s. I do not think it really can be considered a noir movie, but it's quite dark sometimes, due to most of the lighting and odd characters of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical shows from each of the three main actors who have done a good job with their roles. I figured, though, that Hopper and Boyle's characters remained unsolved, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is a boyfriend or I hate a guy. The land is very good, and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand over to the director (ie when he first sees the serif). Overall, this movie is worth watching. *** 1/2
