This is not a bad movie. It's not strangely funny, but it's interesting and fun. It has some funny moments. Cher offers a good performance in a very different role from the real life itself. Its performance alone deserves the clock. If this movie came out today, it would not have been nominated, but by the 1980s it was excellent.
