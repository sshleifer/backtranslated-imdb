I watched the movie as I recovered from major surgery. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a Western space, I loved it. I may have missed the flash of high-dollar productions that I did not imagine and gave me a great escape. Unfortunately, our society has so much availability, discarding small attempts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy school performance at Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for art. I'm a cop and I found affinity with retired LAPD. Dreams like my haunting that I will not be able, at the time of the crisis, to be able to respond to save the life of another (or mine). While it was a romantic ending in which Farnsworth took out the evil (predictable) we needed a small happy tale in which the good could triumph. My world is really too cynical.
