Note that I did not say it's better ... more enjoyable. Lack of social and realistic comments helps keep things moving. In fact, I was surprised that it was not a Troma movie, with all the Troma trademarks, including acidic liquids, wicked witches after each crime, a ridiculous rape scene in the bathtub (which is a little bit upset, because the rapist is a snowman) and foolish deputies. There's a lot to be loved: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who notices his legs or feet, runs a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if it is supposed to be near frost (or below), nobody's breath does not look and there are no signs of car evacuation when the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you more of peanut or peanut peanut than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl receives boys for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is honestly murdered. He tells him to break into the sheriff's house, from all places, to do his job. But first, he tells him he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open a wine. 5. When Jake's teenage boy's head is interrupted by a sledman, his father argues with the sheriff if Tommy, the sheriff's son, is dealing with him. The sheriff claims that Tommy would not have fought Jake because Jake "is at least two feet taller than Tommy." At that moment, someone in the background lights up: "No longer! <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally melts, the sheriff struggles with a flat snowman made of some kind of fabric for a long time. This is much better than the fight with Tarzan with rubber crocodiles or gladiators struggling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have been able to keep a straight face right now. Overall, a fun movie. There's not too much blood.
