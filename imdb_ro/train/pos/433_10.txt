This is one of those rare movies, it is wonderful and convincing, dignified and weird, a real gift. I think it is a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or for any holiday, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (see magic). I loved Josie Lawrence in the role of Lottie Wilkins, but every leading and supporting actor is perfect in this movie. Next, the costumes, if you are attracted to fashion and costumes, are extraordinarily well made. I just want to release it on DVD because I wear my tape version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth the time, just make sure you sit down to watch without interruption.
