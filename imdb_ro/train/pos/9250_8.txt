Clark Gable plays a con man who busts in the life of boiled women Jean Harlow. He tries to beat him as he removes him with his gross attitude. Despite cynicism and against them, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a blow, he ends up leaving Harlow loyal to the woman's prison, where she discovers she is pregnant. Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers's writing are excellent throughout life, with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman and a black woman owned and her father's father playing with almost a stereotype trail). Gable and Harlow show their miracle as actors who add some nuances and strange characters to them that send them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. A beautiful shot makes Harlow put in jail, then led into a surprising snowy yard as the camera watches her. This is one of the best genres of "criminals in love" and "prison for women" and has some of the best ever cooked dialogues ever written.
