I have to vote for 10 out of 10 in the rare chance of seeing this review, pitying me, praying at Hollywood and engaging in her weird / funny world. But with all seriousness, it was good. The first episode obviously finds his feet, but he has that oddity from Silverman that goes through him. It's not like a good comedy, but that's a good thing, too much has a laugh-track for it, and that would not be right with the clues to laugh, it's for the audience to hear the inner buffoon laughing at the absurdity of everything . I can easily see this as the bizarre Drew Carey show with strange characters and an incredibly strong central character. Well, it's worth a watch, I look forward to the following episodes. A very good chance in the ordinary comedy. <br /> <br /> PS, Sarah? Call me ....
