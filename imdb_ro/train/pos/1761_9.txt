Only once at a time we get a R-rating comedy that has the time and attention of everyone. It's an even less rare case for critics to want. I just came back from the 40-year-old Virgo and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to a display at 10:35 and every row was filled. Not only that, everyone laughed their ass all the time. There are two hours of laughter non-stop. I dare to see this movie and not to laugh. The land is simple. A man is forty years old and a virgin. However, behind this simple five-second joke, we are offered a profound and complex story that is not just one of the funniest you will ever witness, but authentic lessons behind it. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, Virgo for 40 years. I met Steve Carell, in my opinion, one of the best stage thieves of all time. Carrying hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially the Anchorman, Steve Carell has gone a long way, finally, and proudly is given the time to shine like the star. No one will forget his name after witnessing this funny, funny, flamboyant, colorful comedy in the aisle. The beauty of the movie is that it's not 100% bad. The brilliant writing by Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really has a purpose and is not just a story to tell. Behind the cruelty and the non-stop vulgar walk of the film comes an important lesson to learn. Although not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us more than just a pleasant time. His stunning attitude will make you laugh all the time while seeing the real fighting of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not have been better. Not only does he deliver what we promised, but he offers one of the most memorable end numbers that a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if there were Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, but you can not win, you can now. Finally, I think, as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener offers a perfect unexplained performance like Trish, the only woman that Andy really has her heart. Not only does it give us laugh, but it's crazy to see how strong the story is. She was perfectly cast in her role and Carell are terribly, let alone hilarious chemistry on the screen. Canadian-wise rating, once again, Ontario slips away with a 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba slapped a 40-year-old girl, an 18-year-old girl. The same thing happened to my four brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say I love Ontario more and more. For all of your teenagers in the United States: Good luck! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell offers one of the funniest shows I have ever seen and almost everyone in the distribution distributes the laughter non-stop. Everyone will love the 40-year-old Virgo this summer and encourage everyone to see her as soon as possible. It's the best comedy of the year with your hands down. He battles all over the Longest Court, Wedding Christmas and of course, the last memorable comedy Apatow and Carell, Anchorman. It is a comic masterpiece and deserves remarkable amount of praise from critics who have been loving. Each of my favorite critics loved her and immediately deserves a spot on the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a huge star. Look at one of the brightest in the summer right now. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objective? 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Subjective? <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
