This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can decide which is the best book or movie. Whoopi Goldberg is great, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, might be fun, happy and miserable all at the same time. All together the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg and was not supposed to pass. 9/10
