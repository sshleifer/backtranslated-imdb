I lost almost all the first season, but when the other shows went to rehearse, I started to look. I've come to buy the whole first season on iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor increases me all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes Russell's going a little. I like more casting members (but I'm not saying they do not add to the show). Do a favor. If you did not check it, try. If you can catch the episode in which "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you will see how good this show is. I hope this series has a long duration.
