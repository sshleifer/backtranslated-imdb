The shows were gorgeous, the costumes gave a unique feeling for that time and they were a living Victorian historian, I was impressed with the accuracy of the weapon and the attention paid to the details. I would not say that you need some knowledge of Kela to stay with the flow of this film, but to understand the happenings and attitudes from the moment you need a bit of basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some fools do, any of the characters that have the accent Auzzie as we know it was at that time a country during childhood. OK, the story had some elements of fiction, but they are necessary for a wider tracking of the movie. Gregor Jordan said in the extra movie on DVD that he wanted his movie to "inspire an interest," and that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie gets his fingers here. <br /> <br /> See and you will not be bad
