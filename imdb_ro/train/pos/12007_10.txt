This is one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I approached about 150 people at St. George and I saw this movie in the visiting center of St. George's Temple. No one had eyes dry in the audience. Also in public there were some unreligious and anti-Mormon people who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by compelling music and the renewal of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> We recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the hardships made by the pioneers. After all, it's apart from American history.
