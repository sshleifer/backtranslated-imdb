I have discovered that this episode is one of the funniest things I have seen for a long time. The creators of the South Park have made the best parody of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched Romero's social commentary that he made with each of his films. I would love to know what George Romero had to say about this episode, I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping the true vision of his completely intact zombie era! Most spoofs deal with the pure gore, without making the spectator think like Romero is trying to do with his movies. I think if a zombie outbreak would happen, we could worry about our property values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
