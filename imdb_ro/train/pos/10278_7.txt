"House of Games" is definitely not without its flaws - plot holes, rigid action, final scenes - but they do not do much to distract the fun of watching a thriller that moves so methodically with its head. "House of Games" does almost everything a good thriller should do. Of course, this is not a huge act, given the fact that we are dealing with people's trustworthy world and their counterparts. So it's logical that we never really know what's going on, even if we think we're doing it. But that makes the movie worth it for those who play; a movie for which repeated views are indulgences instead of necessities. She has a clear propensity for Hitchcock. The film relies on several similar themes found in his 1964 effort, "Marnie," considered unclear when released, but now viewed as one of the most challenging works of the Master. It might be easy to consider the idea that Lindsay Crouse's character is the same as Tippi Hedrin ... ten years later. Both are strong loners, both with compulsive behaviors that force them to go too close to the shark pool. Just as the repressed and tight character of Crouse says: "What is life without adventure?" Put the Reality Check on a low set and enjoy swim sharks!
