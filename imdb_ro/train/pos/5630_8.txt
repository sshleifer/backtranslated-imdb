Marjorie (a splendid and riveting interpretation by Farrah Fawcett) avoids being assaulted in the car by a serious rapist Joe (played gorgeously with conviction and dreadful intensity by James Russo). However, Joe steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He pays him a day of death. After marrying Marjorie to a lot of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn Joe's tables and lock him in the fireplace. What does Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone create a harsh, harsh and often disturbing morality story that finds strangely the strict brutality and painful despair of rape, while also showing that every person, when pushed to the extreme, is capable of violent and inhuman shocks. Joe perceives women strictly as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal". However, this film, to his admirable credit, refuses to make Joe simply a one-dimensional rape. Instead, he is a human monster, terribly truthful and ultimately pitiful, with a wife and child (especially Joe's climatic confession is really painful). Fawcett and Russo are both in the charts; they receive the pleasant support of Diana Scarwid as passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as Patricia Sensitive and Sandy Martin as sympathetic police officer Sudow. Both the agile cinema of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's sparkling skin, which pierces the skin, considerably increases the claustrophobic tension. A real power.
