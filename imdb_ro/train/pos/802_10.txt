I know I know it was a good end, but honestly it was great. I like when a movie ends in a wonderful nature, but this time I was impressed by Darth Vader turning against the Emperor, I really was stunned. The success in that movie was when Luca was tortured and defeated by Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, removes his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinema of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of the Rebel Battle and all the imperial war ships and the Super Star destroyers. I liked the new race they brought on the screen Mon Calomari, Ewoks, the Sullestean (Lando's pilot) and more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in that movie: 1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is mortally wounded . 2 - When Luke sees Obi-Wan and Yoda's spirits and then Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (Star Wars star scene) 3- When LEIA kills Jabba, croaking murderer Hutt. /> I personally like the scenario and battle of Endor, which features a fight on the ground and space, as well as the best duel of the Star Wars between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on Death Star. Post-script: Scenes with Leia in slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.
