If you like "Othello," you like this movie because half of the film revolves around the scenic production of the play. The film has a big cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's life while Edmond O'Brien plays the entertaining press agent. Some of the players I really liked were Millard Mitchell as a grizzled reporter who finds an angle, and Joe Sawyer, the 1940 response to Drew Carey, who plays the policeman on the cage. <br /> <br /> Big moments in this case with noir realism all the time.
