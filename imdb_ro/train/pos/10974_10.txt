Why should you look at this? There is certainly no reason why you should not watch it! Amazingly funny and directed by Albert and David Maysles, Gray Gardens was originally meant to be a film about East Hampton gentrification, but it turned out to be more exciting to make a study of the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales, Aunt and the cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly amusing (Edith spent most of her day in bed singing, Edie performing pigeons and dances with a master of many cats, one being called Ted Z. Kennedy). The movie is interesting because it's funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released (in February 1977), aged 82, after she met some of the fame she and Edie got After filming (she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and still lives in Miami Beach. This film is so engaged and spellbounding.
