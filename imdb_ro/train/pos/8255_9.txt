Fido is a nice comedy that deserves a wider recognition, especially with regard to the mass stupidity that we should have fun nowadays. As has already been pointed out, this movie is hardly a real zombie movie, a nice satire that uses the strigo to show your fingers. While there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (style 50s), I can not imagine anyone being scared or stopped by Fido and the other sufferers. > <br /> While the distribution is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson were remarkable. Humor is not in front of you, but rather subjected; there is a great deal of attention to detail and I caught smile benign more throughout the movie. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not strive to be - Currie, on the other hand, manages to produce a black comedy.
