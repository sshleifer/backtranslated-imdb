This is one of my preferences of all time. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a romantic chicken-like comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and that's what it's ... One of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters: "You're thinking about what I'm thinking," and Ed says, "Now, what's going on That's what I think, a movie is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and you can get the same joy behind it, and with that, you can! I also enjoyed the way of Walter M. de Einstein's portrayal I think all the characters fit well and the story goes well They are so many times I find myself smiling straight with the movie and quoting my favorite lines as they follow him I would recommend this movie to anyone has a heart and enjoys a romantic comedy of good-of-now feeling!
