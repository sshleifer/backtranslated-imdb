This film may not put the Catholic church in the best light, but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is beautiful and pink. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem right now, but in retrospect they do not look as wonderful as they once did. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, including religion, but the story really is about a family and the family's ability to stay together no matter what is cast on them. This film is also based on true events, which does not mean that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you look at news articles of that period, you will see that churches have not handled the incident in a way helped the family. Both churches are to blame here, the Catholic church for forcing such a family regulation first and not responding to the violence that came with her and the Protestant church to tell her mother that she only needs to obey her husband and priest and not the fight. In this case, both have left this family down. I think the film does a good job in showing this fight both in the church and in the family. In no way does the form or form put down the Catholic Church, but just the opposite, shows how an incident can change the course of the ideas of religion and how a person can have a much greater effect than then.
