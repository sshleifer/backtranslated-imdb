Blonde and Blonde has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more of a movie, you are absolutely unreasonable. It feels like a late Carry On era, when the series was no longer a burning track, but it was even more fun than not, think behind England and you will not be too far from the mark. Pamela and Denise are courageous, charming, and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece I do, although you can give me a lot of things I've been told to like. Support towers are energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a few turns in a movie that is already practically forgotten, making a lot of difference to anything, so just a smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder are needles and I hope you hate me for that.
