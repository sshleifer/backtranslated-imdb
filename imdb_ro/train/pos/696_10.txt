Surprisingly well done for an independent movie, An Insomniac's Nightmare is painting an amazing picture of what you might be suffering from insomnia. Wonderfully written and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream, while the spectator is taken one night in the life of an insomniac. With Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we get to see what he sees as one-night long hours. The narrative is almost hypnotizing, and it is impossible to return from the opening lines. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how one can handle a lack of sleep, balancing on the edge of the distance between health and madness. With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and committed. It is highly recommended.
