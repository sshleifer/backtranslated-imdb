this movie is such a moving, amazing work. I saw her at the theater when she was out, but I was only 13 years old and I did not really "get it" ... I saw her again when I was 20 years old (on the video, of course, and now I own it) and it just ran . Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped in it from beginning to end. I also read the book, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. casting, act, music, costume, scenery, everything, is great. laugh, cry, cheer up ... it reveals any emotion that can be imagined. is one of his best works and should not be missed!
