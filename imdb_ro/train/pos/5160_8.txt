Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock are caught in the ice age of the planet, and Capt. Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, the former pair has the hardest time. In addition to the frost and sanctuary temperatures found only in caves, there is a third resident, beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this age, he slowly begins to return to his ancestors' behavioral patterns, feeling a natural attraction to Zarabet and casting "prudence in the wind" to leave this place. With McCoy's constant "reminders," Spock is afraid of reality. This position is one of the few moments when the character becomes "emotion" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it on the handle, approaching the beating of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly in a previous installment, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to receive the girl, another addition for him. Ian Wolfe, the "old" perennial, tests the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio in the past.
