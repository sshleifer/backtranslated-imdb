Like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, I can not ask why this has never appeared on the video. I remember seeing her at the age of 12 in "The Late Show" around 1972. And I remember the poisonous gas attack and the horses dressed strangely. (I do not remember the worst pieces I've seen described here, probably cut them off to the TV audience.) But the scenes I really liked were those involving Lord Kitchener's death aboard HMS Hampshire , 90 years ago. The convicted cruise scenes approaching my field in the storm have really cooled, as I remember. You do not remember the musical score, but the comments of others are looking curiously now. Take it on the video!
