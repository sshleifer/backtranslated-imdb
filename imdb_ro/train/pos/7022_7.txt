FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I waited for the film to appear for almost a year and eventually I saw it at the premiere in SB. I met some actors who were really nice and who were wonderful in the movie. I watched the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I totally went into it. The film was really nice to look at him and the music was good too. recommend it to anyone who is a fan of ryan donowho and dominique swain was good in it too. the other actors were also good. I hope it will appear on DVD soon !!!!! I first went to Ryan to watch the OC and then I saw him in a bunch of good Indians like imaginary Heroes. He's great in this movie and everything he does is indie. I also like Dominique, but I have not seen it as much. I hope to see both of them sooner!
