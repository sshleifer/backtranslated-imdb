I was deeply excited about this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! A beautiful girl. Her actor was superb. Real life and very human. Although I do not like the part she was supposed to smoke; I hope it was just a fake motive. Anyway, it was absolutely wonderful, and the story moved so much. I found myself immersed in the story and her character. It's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie in fact. I was walking in the blockbuster and I just realized that she smiled pretty well on the cover while I was walking. Fortunately, I looked in the downward direction that this movie was in! I thought, "Awe, look at her!" So I took it and I saw that this movie was described as wonderful things like "A Little Gem". I read the plot on the back and then I thought, well, I would first look at IMDb and then go back and rent it later. I'm glad I did not, because I would have missed it. After I searched for a movie with my friend, I knew I would regret not renting this movie, so I went back to where I first found it and I broke it. has been on my wardrobe for a week since school started for me this week and I did not have time to look at her but tonight it was a perfect opportunity. I grabbed it and was stuck to a beautiful cinema, a delightful score, and a movement from start to finish. I was so captivated and I have to say, some parts almost moved me tears. I would also like to make a special mention for this boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. It was remarkable. Also, the actor who played Carol's father, who, unfortunately, is not listed on the site. His voice was so loving and gentle that I could really feel his love for Carol. Even though his appearance is not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. This is really a great movie. If you are a person who is moved by bright but emotional movies, then this is certainly one for you.
