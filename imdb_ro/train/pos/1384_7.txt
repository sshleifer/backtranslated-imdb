Also known as "Water Lilies," this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle to enter the world of love and sex. This story is said at a slow pace and works very well. It offers plenty of time and space to get to know different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them. Using a small cucumber puts additional pressure on the people who play because they all have more screen time than normal but the people who play in this movie are doing so well. Everyone is completely credible. The visual setting is great, especially the underwater photos in the pool adds a nice effect. Many movies have been made about the same subject and yet it is not really different from any of them. They pull some "standard" pressure methods out of the high hat and work on them. It's not bad at all, but it's definitely not great, and I think it could have done better if it had taken some less explored angles. 7 of 10 synchronous swimmers
