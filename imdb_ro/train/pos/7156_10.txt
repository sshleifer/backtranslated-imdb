Holes is a great movie. I like it very much and it's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few Disney movies that is not cheese. Holes are generally a very cool picture. I want Disney to make more pictures like this. Holes are indeed a rare breed of Disney fury shows that is cold. Do not understand the wrong idea, I do not want to guess Disney mouth, but most of the stuff is for the kids and it's ok. Children deserve to have their entertainment as well. But Disney was guilty of trying to turn to the teenage audience and usually fails. But not with the holes. It's the type of movie anyone can watch and enjoy, and not once thinks it's a cornice. Indeed, it is a kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy because there are characters that they can refer to. Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment, but not too cheesy and living a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more movies like this.
