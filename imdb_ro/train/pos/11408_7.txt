Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the kind of person he almost never knows his name. However, he once again plays the coroner - one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that have played his part several times. I've already seen him twice and loved him every time because he was so funny and a fresh breath. Also, this movie is great to watch that, in addition to Girardot, there are other wonderful characters along the journey - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is an impressive cast and has certainly made it easier for the male and female leader Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. These great characters are one of the great reasons that these old B movies love. While the mystery itself is rarely so great, thanks to the writing and the actor, the film really satisfies. As for this movie, Vance is greatly played by Lowe, but, as I said, the mystery itself is just a later thought - with a bad plot involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything like this - I'm training in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something like the bad one I could do in the movie, I would have done it! Car dealers and some of my old bosses would have been visible! <br /> <br /> Overall, while it was not the best Philo Vance movie, it was really good and it's a daring shame Lowe just played this role once. Besides William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hindered by a long and long succession of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others), playing Vance. This is a similar problem that has affected the Bulldog Drummond series - too many different actors playing the leading role. <br /> <br /> They are well worth seeing and interesting - though also quite impossible.
