This is a movie I can always watch and never get tired of, has many laughs, weapons, actions, crimes, good lines and a decent, top-notch plot, Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role as Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she can and she can act too much, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in acting as "Max" character, a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier to TV, bad guy, "Livingston". The center is based on Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while fighting and quarreling with each other about who gets the money for those agencies, throws into the Assassin Sutherland mix, which has almost all the best, perfecting perfect crime , there is the usual love story, but it played very differently than you think of Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian Mafia, the Italian Mafia and the Chinese Mafia here in the mix, the movie is shot in Boston, where you have some extraordinary and local photos, a great photo and music in this movie, this movie is just the symbol of a crime comedy , has everything he ever wanted to want. Check out Sutherland's toilet in a certain scene, very unusual. this movie is a revolt and will make you laugh hard 10 plus for me.
