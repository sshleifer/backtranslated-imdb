A long-closed prison, closed for over 20 years, is reopened, and Ethan Sharpe (late actor, great character Lane Smith), once a watchman there, is put into service as a guardian. While prisoners are put to work to fix the place, they are instructed to enter the old execution room. It unleashes a ferocious spirit that makes merciless harm to both guards and prisoners; (Viggo Mortensen, who presents a true poetry in a primordial role) is pushed into the role of hero. I know it's incomprehensible to praise a movie for his atmosphere (he was shot in a real abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror film to a higher level. It has a great sense of transformation, established right from the beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; they led him to the concert "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and actually began an impressive career in action movies, thrillers and horror films. They can have stock characters but have a talent to bring them to life: the Chelsea Field as a young woman fighting for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a tired veteran convicted Cresus, Tom Everett as an unshakable Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as Lasagna, Tommy " Tiny "Lister as giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It is also noted as an early credit for Kane Hodder (as revenge spirit), who helped him land the concert to play Jason Voorhees in the series "Friday 13". <br /> <br /> A bad illusion of the filmmaker Mac Ahlberg, the scary music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, an extraordinary vision, incredibly gloomy location and a general, light and intense presentation to make it pretty of fun. It's an ugly, terrible and fun thing for a fan of horror. <br /> <br /> 8/10
