The first time I saw that, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only about fifteen, and I thought maybe a deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I saw him the second time a few months ago, and this time, because Felix's suicide attempts at the beginning of the movie darkened the film a little. This scene has done some of the things Oscar told them and made Felix later in the movie to be useless cruel, and their personality confrontations were not as amusing as it could have been. If I had not known the story before, I would have been worried that some of Oscar's antics at Felix might push him over the edge. As it was, did not make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, a good film and gave birth to one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
