This is one of the most fun series ever! I laughed until my parts broke apart and rolled on the floor. If someone were to be released in America. Region 0 or 1 - non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know it's released in the UK, but that's Region 2 and PAL out! Let's give this series his fair shock. America needs to know this series. Moffat is a genius. I liked Tracie Bennett's weird and whimsical role. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Thrace was a treasure! Release the show in America! or play it back on PBS. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please reward us, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
