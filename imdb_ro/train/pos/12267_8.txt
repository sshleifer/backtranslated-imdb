Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I borrowed the books from the school library all the chances I received. The most preferred of me was "Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. This documentary was a brilliant exhibition of Herge's story and the development of Tintin. The personal experience of the filmmaker in Herge's interview and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the source of inspiration for the character Chan was very moving. A great documentary by a very talented and well-loved artist. An extraordinary example of someone who has become internationally famous and brought the joy of millions of children (and young people to heart) around the world.
