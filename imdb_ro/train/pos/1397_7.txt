"Shore Leave" is mostly a Star Trek adventure average. There is nothing wrong with the episode. I think this is not the best representation of what the show has given fans. It's easy fun, nothing more. However, I'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough value to make a break from the serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew a free time, and a landing party is drawn to a planet that seems to be the perfect place for a holiday. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it may seem. There are moments of action and tension, but most of the story is played for laughter. Okay, but unexceptional.
