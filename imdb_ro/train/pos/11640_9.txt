What I liked most about this movie is that, like Hitchcock's films, it's a thriller that does not take it seriously. Hitchcock understood that people are going to the movies to have a good time. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but she has a lot of laughs and always has a flashing eye on the room. Rachel McAdams is great as always. Cillian Murphy is later than he was in Batman Begins. In old times there were guys who always played the bad guy. I do not see much of these days because I suspect that Hollywood agents think it's a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is very good at bad. The director is surprising. The story is good, but the dialogue could have used others. "Red Eye" is a very fun movie and people applauded when closing credits began to roll. If you're in the mood for a pleasant escape thriller, "Red Eye" might be your ticket.
