My Super Ex girlfriend was a nice surprise for me, we were really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be bad and predictable and you know what? Was! But this movie had so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick from. I know this was a very stunning movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such an extraordinary addition along with an extraordinary cast that seemed to have so much fun and that made the movie work. > <br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, my best friend) is not your usual woman as a librarian looking for a woman when Matt, your average man asks her, is in more than expected, asked G -Girl at a meeting, super hero of the world! But when she finds out what a jealous and crazy little girl she is and she decides it would be a good idea to spend some time, but Jenny will not have it since she fell for another girl, Hannah, and she will make her life a living hell , I mean, let's face him, he could not have picked a better girl to break up. The effect was corny, but seriously you move fast, story and cast did the really work story and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step up from Prime. My Super Ex girlfriend is a fun movie you should not really take seriously, it's just a nice romantic comedy that I think if I could laugh at it anybody could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
