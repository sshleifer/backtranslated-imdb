"Mask" is a moving film that works on multiple levels. The simplest story is that of a street interpreter who binds a child while trying to pass through his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although sometimes the story makes the old man become a job, it is so well done (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it is easy to go beyond his situation. And if you stay with her, the movie is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos everywhere. This is a great movie for both children and adults. The trick is how to attract Americans who may not like foreign language films?
