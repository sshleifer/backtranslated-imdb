I lost my number of times when I saw this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue back - yet I was drawn to it from time to time. In Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible license "Kralik," who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent Klara. Kralik secretly becomes Klara's secretary, and at work Klara is made in Kralik on the contents of his letters (to Kralik). Obviously, Kralik is assaulted with Klara - but he is unable to make his feelings known while he is in competition with his "pen-friend". Confused? Well, you will not be - this story has a sweet, almost sweet ending - but we all know it's the end we all want. Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time the owner of the Hugo Matuschek shop, Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch," Kralik's confidante. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant female "Vadas" - so well played that you can only help him to hate him right from the start. Finally, William Tracy, who manages to fall in love with all of us with his confident start of a "Pepi Katona" junior shop. Recently re-fabricated as "You've got mail" with Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - though they suspect younger audiences would agree. If this movie is in your Christmas area, we suggest that you pour a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a Kleenex box at your fingertips.
