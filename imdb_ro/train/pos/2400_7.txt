I see what my priests saw in Bette Davis's youth. She is splendid in all of this political comedy, close to the madman, who sees Warren Williams as a political operative constantly following his feed. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as her former, and I found myself rooted for her all the time. The character of Williams is not at all inclusive and neither is he a decent service op. Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate, he came out of his sleep at a political convention and was appointed governor to prevent the nomination of a rival candidate, so this whole mess is waged by the international political war in a party called the Progressive Party. If you have a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one you're affiliated with reflected in Williams and Kibbee's "Progressive Party" fiction. I could draw parallel, but we're not here for that. This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever seen any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, Williams's right arm, who looks and behaves a lot like Bert Wheeler. I was fooled. Yes, both my wife and I recommend this.
