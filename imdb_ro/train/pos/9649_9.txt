Presented at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title "Come Undone," 25, 26, 27 April 2001. Cinematography uses techniques that add the story. Even with autumn / winter for "summer" and spring summer for "flashbacks," there may be difficulties in pursuing continuity. Whether lead is homosexual, actors have a good relationship in real terms; from physical violence to the other to their passionate love. The story pulls you in the characters a bit slow at the beginning. But as the end is near you really care about where the boys will be in the next summer! And you'll want a sequel to find out.
