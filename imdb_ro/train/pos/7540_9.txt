I liked this movie pretty much. I have always been a Whoopi Goldberg fan and this film just emphasizes this. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family who moves up the social chain because of her husband's success (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. It moves into a white neighborhood, where people are friendly but a little strange to her. The various events that occur during the movie make some laugh, but in most cases turn to other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. We recommend that you pick it up on TV or rent it soon.
