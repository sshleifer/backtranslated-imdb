Vaguely remembered about the vestiges of the 1940s, such as The Sierra Madre Treasure (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed, and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a Texas couple who heads west and looks for money and money. He finds both, but not as he had expected. The film's script contains a lot of surprises and twists. Excellent cinema, great movie editing and Western cheerful music add tension and suspense. The expansiveness of the great country of heaven provides a wonderful setting. And acting varies from good to excellent, with extraordinary performance from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam, the specially recorded track, records the film with a strong final. <br /> <br /> Correctly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" considers me to be something else. The land is full of amazing and unlikely coincidences, so much so that others think the script is wrong. Normally, I would agree. In this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the little town of Red Rock seems almost empty of ordinary life, coincidences and time unlikely suggest a story that, beyond the noirish, is ... unreal. It's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with unlikely events to force Michael to deal with himself. From this point of view, coincidences are not script defects. They are plotting points needed in a hairstyle story of a young man who has to confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining his always clearly expressed voice that ... a young man, looking for himself, stops in a small, almost deserted city, a thousand miles out of nowhere. It's his final station on a trip to the ... twilight area.
