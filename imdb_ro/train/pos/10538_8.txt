I work at a movie store and as such, I'm always looking for an excellent movie. We decided to check Nothing as it stood in our Canadian section and tried to support the country's cinema industry. I was in a surprise. The film presents David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very fun story that seems to multiply so much in our minds and relationships ... without working so hard. It is a consistent comedy through the interaction of the two characters, as well as funny exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have a cable!"). What else can I say without saying that it deserves a shot, even if you abandon it in the first half an hour.
