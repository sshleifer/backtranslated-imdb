Interesting, fast-paced and funny. I'm not one of those people watching loads and a lot of television. I came across this show while home sick with a bad flu case one day and was immediately coupled. I have developed quite a lot on John Burke. Both he and Claire have done an amazing job of hosting the show together. You could really say that they both loved their jobs. The super-collector segments were excellent. I found myself interested in things that I never gave a single thought. What I would like to know is: What happened to Jack the dog? Is one of the hosts adopting it?
