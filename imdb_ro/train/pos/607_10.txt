Maybe I loved this movie so much, because I felt down in the pits and it's kind of a wonderful little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Story of great, intelligent, beautiful effects, excellent action (especially De Niro, which is wonderful). This movie made me happier than I was for a while. It's a very funny and intelligent movie. The shameful gesture of the history of the kingdom about the prince's savage and its consequences, the way the magic witch's effects were attributed to her and dozens of smart touches, all made me enthusiastic. That's a lot of what makes it so good; is an elaborate film with special effects with more story than most fairytales, yet there is incredible attention to small things. I feel like I'm going further and forget it all.
