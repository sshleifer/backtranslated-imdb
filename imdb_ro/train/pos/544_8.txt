I liked this movie. It was almost the same as the first (the lake cottage), just to kill only women, it also kills the men. And the scenes are more exciting, 2 of my favorite scenes are first when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and describe Kimberly's last moments before being thrown to the water, and secondly when Stanley visits Allison in basement, just before going to the set when kissing him. These scenes for me were very intense and riveted. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, that is, there were times when you noticed that nothing was wrong, as if it was shot the way a movie is usually shot, you did not see the camera's "live" shooting, but very little you would notice shooting errors. what went wrong?
