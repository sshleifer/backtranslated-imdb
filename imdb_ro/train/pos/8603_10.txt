The film is a fantasy. The story line is thin, but it serves as a structure on which beautiful songs are sung and played. (I still can not believe such beautiful and attractive people could play this well.) Some of the dialogues are wonderfully intelligent. The costumes made me feel like watching a haute couture fashion show in 1942. The films are designed to serve different purposes. It is designed to be entertained and certainly does. If I have a negative comment, Nelson Eddy would have been a little too old to be a nice conjure. Some of my approaches made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing magnificently. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as blinding as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. This genre is long before my time, and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and the conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love classic rock music that fills the most modern movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this music is simply more memorable, more delightful, better built. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see today in cinemas. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. It is unclear why so many other posters are apologetic about the preference of this film and, in general, of this group of films. They say it's dated and trying to explain why it is. And those who do not like say it's not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly continue to be fun when many other movies are forgotten. There is not much quality in all respects in this movie so that it is not remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to any user who appreciates the talent, beauty and extraordinary music.
