I really enjoyed this movie. I hired this by waiting for something not too bad to spend an evening. It has been a particularly satisfying experience. Some of the scenes were hilarious and they managed to be so in a movie that does not intend to be just a stupid comedy, but with certain moral values ​​and meanings. He leads both counts. The leaders are all good, but especially the one who sees, produced the movie. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were sympathetic and cared for what happens to them in the end, which says a lot. The script is intelligent and involved and has a refreshing feel. I think you will not be disappointed to look at this.
