Since 1994, we had a really long holiday around July 4 - something like 17 days off a row, which with two weeks of paid vacation, weekend and holiday itself. I stayed in the city at that time, and I stayed very much at my parents' house. I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I was looking at my parents' tube. I just finished watching a X Files segment when a program called Personal FX appeared. I was instantly engaged. I have always been fascinated by the objects in our house that came from the homes of my parents' family and by inheritance from the property of my relatives, and I have often asked my story, the value, etc. After my long trip, I used to go to my house during lunchtime just to catch FX personnel. I remember an episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment, in which the series was filmed, was renovated and that once renovations were complete, the Personx FX would return to the air. Never did! Personal FX was the first and best of the collections. And he's gone out of the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still painful. How to go, FX.
