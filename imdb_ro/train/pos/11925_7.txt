I happened to get this movie on cable after an afternoon. I have to admit I've never been a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good movie about the sport. What seemed more interesting to me was the representation of the foster family system. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad mental health of the community and the stimulus system, I was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the traces and downsides of this system: people who leap from family to family, parents do not always take active involvement and transitions that can not be broken by the heart and melt in the heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film and both deliver very credible performances. Perhaps it was just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding a tear at the end of the movie.
