The best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely rich effects, but also branches of human mind, soul and philosophy. The story presents a cat family, where the big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and rescues his body, but when he wakes up, he is left without a soul. So the two cats embarked on a journey to find her. We have associated this journey with many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I follow it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so in the physiological aspect of it, then you will adore. The animation is superb, and creative scenes will fit you on the screen. For example, the ocean froze in time, the god is eating soup from the earth, a strange and easy storytelling by Hansel and Gretel. In conclusion, Cat Supa is an absolute treatment for anyone. PS - Not for children, including free violence.
