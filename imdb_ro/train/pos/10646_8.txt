This great movie is largely composed of the documentary film currently featured on a DVD with Prelude to War. The great American cinema and narrator Frank Capra made these films that simply draw attention to the main points that provoked World War II and the rise of Hitler. Every school child, whatever it is, every American should watch movies today because they are so close. History is always repeated! Lord Chamberlains is still alive and hit; the tactics used by the Nazis by countries infiltrating the sympathizers, and then the Communists and now by the Muslim terrorist groups, are still working to the advantage of these evil groups. Stretching and leaving Hitler aggressive since 1935 - France, America and England have caused deaths of more than 50 million people. The Americans, the French and the British today would let Hitler do the same thing, despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let the dictators break the treaties. These great movies can be too simplistic World War II. They do not say the horrors the Soviet Union simply caused because when America was equipped with them, fighting Hitler. This film tells the true facts and reasons that led to the terrible war.
