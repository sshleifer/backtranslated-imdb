Pretty good image of a man who is in a wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to tear the lady, why not just get her off and let the cops try to figure out how it was going to happen? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths that you have to worry about remaining closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit or say a word? Are there really policemen there, which are wise cracks, clogging gums, smiling monkeys approaching a suspect in such a glib manner? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented, but it's so corny and unbelievable today. Grab the maniacal pause by Elisha Cook; his frenetic hammer never fit with the record. His facial expressions made for stick synchronization.
