I thought the kids in the show did a really good job. I was especially pleased with the performance of the Emma character. Very good! The waterfalls were good enough for a low budgeted show. I managed to watch the movie and enjoy it without having to watch my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the toothbrush and her burning. The ghostly appearances of the children of the released children were also good. Another good point of the movie is that he continued to move. There were not many slow scenes. Adult leaders were also credible and therefore helped keep the show fun. All in all a pleasant night watching the movie.
