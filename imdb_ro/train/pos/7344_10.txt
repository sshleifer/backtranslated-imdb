In my opinion, this is a good example of the film that could have been much better if it was a short 10 years before. I doubt it would benefit from modern technology, but it would have been much better if it had been at least 90 minutes instead of 70. Artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this movie boasts the finest background art and the best character design. The animation is extremely smooth and realistic. During the movie you believe in the world you see, so everyone has done a great job. She can also boast one of the most sexy, animated female characters, if not the most sexy, that embraces typical anime girls with ease. Unfortunately, there is a series of negative disorientation about this movie, which will not make it so appealing at this time. First, plotting and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films and are truly old-fashioned. Secondly, due to the length of time, it would greatly benefit from another 20 minutes of dialogues. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment. Conclusion: A great alternative to another short story about the Barbarian Conan, but not a novel.
