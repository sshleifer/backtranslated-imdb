I liked this movie so much that I've seen it twice, and that's about a documentary. The musical score, the cinema and the sound are absolutely stunning, as you would expect from an Imax production. Even if shot for these immeasurable theaters, Imax looks and sounds great in my home system. In fact, this would make a perfect DVD to showcase your system. The subject is also so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racing engine in history because he is the only one to win the CART Championship, F1 Championship, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The scenario follows the path of two very important father and son cars. The first car is in a chicken basket and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario has ever driven and followed the restoration to brilliant perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow it from cutting the mold through the racing season. Imax offers just the right magic to make building fun and fascinating cars. Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time of this film, tells the story. His anecdotes and wittism, fired for many years as owner and driver, give a lot to production. The main feature is race scenes. Raise the volume here! There is something about traveling along over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you on the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The ultimate magic element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This racing world god, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who proudly watches his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can say I'm a close family. I wish we could have all the experience.
