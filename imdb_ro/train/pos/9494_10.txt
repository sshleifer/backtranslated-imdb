WHITE FIRE has been recommended to me by a guy who owns two separate DVDs and VHS. He claimed to be one of the most entertaining and the best low-budget cemeteries ever made. Generally, I do not watch movies knowing they will be bad, but I made an exception for that ... and I was very glad I did. It is filled to the edge with an action (much surprising, gorilla graphics), sleaze (isolated from nudity with a key female character, but so much in one scenario that it becomes hilarious) and a strange scandalous dialogue, all of which add to the tone of the film. Ginty, the unusual star of EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget action turbulence), is amusing in the lead, giving her the best performance she can get. Williamson is better than usual, clearly knocking him with unmatched joy (and not coming to the middle of the road). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the bastards, one of which is a sadistic sexpot that speaks with an accent that seems to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. She is invaluable. Again, I can not tell you how stupid it is. It's not so bloody that it's wrong, but it's something unusually violent in parts, with some food shields that go back to fireworks, and has a tortuous torture sequence that no man will forget soon. Also, when Ginty is overwhelmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently receives a chain saw, and the spraying moments that follow will have any and all fans of action that applaud and scatter beers. <br /> <br /> Do not miss FIRE. It's an act of disturbing action - if it's wonderful stupid.
