As with other commentators, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library to search all I could about this story. I even wrote to PBS for more information. Despite all these things, all we could find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. Fastward in 2002 after years of searching on ebay for a week and there was a VHS copy of film. There was another bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The bailiff who missed me wrote the request for a copy I gave him. Although I owned a copy, I searched for it and finally looked for a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie.
