"Good Earth" is a wonderful movie that you can not hear anymore. There are many big disasters and events, but it's also a heartless love story. All this happens in less than two hours, which is short of current standards. Special effects and costumes are great for the time. I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role. In principle, she has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and broken by the heart. The performances of Asian and Asian American actors are terrible. <br /> <br />
