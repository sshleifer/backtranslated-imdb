brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the memories of childhood full of terror from stories like IT - just the opposite. There is no terror in these childhood that any of the friends - who are still friends 20 years and older - remember or seem to suffer. On the line everything is described as a friendly jostling, probably periodically described as "picking on" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no "angst" movie, and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are the young people who grew essentially the same people. More mature, but essentially the same people and the same power structures. Pretty amazing! Not just because people can really grow relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this sense, this film is a small Pearl - as it is supposed to be the intention of the film: A portrait of unforced emotions connects people together. What, seen in opposition to later films, portraying the dark faces of childhood - violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine are what is happening easily, but since the mid-1980s, along with the growing adoration of children and childhood of 1,000 commercials, animations, and series directed directly to children), several films and documentaries have been successful in portraying the dark parts of growth - abuse, loneliness, pushing for excellence - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, to look "!" <br /> <br /> Thank you for that. Or the illusion of counterweight ... 8/10
