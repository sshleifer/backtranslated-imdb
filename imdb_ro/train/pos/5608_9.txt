Of course, it quickly became unclear after this film, but from "Knife in the Water" to "Locator," Roman Polanski could always be counted to offer something fascinating and unique. Despite many themes running (alienation, paranoia), two of his films are not as similar. The story of this is somewhat akin to its own "repulsion" ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. The "tenant" manages to balance darker absurdity than darkness (I am a bit hesitant to call humor, even if the bizarre behavior and dialogue of the protagonists were occasionally funny) with a really tense paranoia. Polanski has always been a master in anxious building, and the moments in this movie are almost unbearably creepy. In addition to Polanski's usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew make great contributions. Polanski's actor is often overshadowed by Polanski, the director, but his performance here truly truly surprises his masterful characters and the feeling of being a prey. The themes of social discrimination make this film more than strange to be weird. The rest of the play offers great performances, especially the likelihood of Isabelle Adjani, and Meelyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters are usually annoying. "The tenant" is often underestimated because people are ready to boast both "repulsion" and "Rosemary's baby," but it is as brilliant as the other classics. (9/10)
