I've read some previous comments stating that this movie is losing steam to the end of the movie and also has a similar end to Cape Fear. I do not agree at all. I'll give a simple review for normal filmmakers. I thought casting was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a bad psychopath! I have a lot of respect for his acting after seeing his performance in this movie. I was ripped through this movie. If you like mystery thrillers, then surely this movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This movie is full of top celebrities and I highly recommend!
