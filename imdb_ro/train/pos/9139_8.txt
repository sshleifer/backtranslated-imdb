The movie is fine, it has moments, the music scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a classic one. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (right for a start, because it's a great and up-tempo party song), Take Me With U, a pop pop song, The Beautiful Ones Ballad, probably the closest thing to R & B on this whole album), Computer Blue (a somewhat angry hymn to Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever made, is very vague in Appolonia) When Doves Cry at this masterpiece ), I'm going to die 4 U, Baby I'm Star and, of course, Purple Rain (a true classic, a very fitting ending for this classic album). The film and the album are both very good. I strongly recommend it!
