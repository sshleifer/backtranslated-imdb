These, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite films Sammo Hung. Fat Dragon is harder on this trip than in "Condors," but it's no less certain as a director or actor. He is, in fact, at the very top of his form and offers a devastating and brutal shareholder who boasts a half dozen stunning sequences and manages to tell a compassionate and sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but serve as an appealing adjunct to action and ensure that viewers do not hit the fast forward button between physical collisions. The opening scene, which has a funny sword of light sword, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence where Sammo's pedicab is followed by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. The rapid and angry battle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a dazzling choreography pattern and a sharp, gorgeous and easy direction one of the best in his history. The violence of the movie escalates slowly until, finally, when the climatic confrontation occurs, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a Sammo production. The director / actor's attack on Billy Chow and a house full of angry and threatening opponents is a bone crack, physically punishing delight. Wonderful at all levels and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Great score too.
