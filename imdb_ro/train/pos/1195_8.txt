I saw this movie about twenty years ago at the late show. I still remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, most critics saw him as a solid, almost boring guy, and women just liked watching his movies because of his appearance. This film, however, has proven what could be an interesting actor. He has not achieved enough roles throughout his long career. This is the best performance. He is totally credible in a really villainous role. From what I read, he was a very hardworking and easy-going man in real life, and he did not fight enough for such roles. He would basically do just what MGM gave him. This film proves that it could handle more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying was the character of Lloyd Nolan. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really made me sick. The last scene of the movie has been stuck with me for all these years. This movie definitely deserves a look.
