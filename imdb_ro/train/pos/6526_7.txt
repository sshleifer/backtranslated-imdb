I always enjoyed watching this when it came to television during the first year of the 60's. It's a typical Hollywood story, dramatized, stylized, and inaccurate, but it's a fun movie and a good movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who had been Beluche's supporter in the '38 film, is the director in his directorial debut and swans, as he has never ever directed a movie and will never be. DeMille has gathered a crew who has recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn pull him out, including DeMille's producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon, who oversees the project. Also, from the ten commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, deputy director Francisco Day, director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, who, as a team of costume designers, received Buccaneer's only Oscar nomination. A large cast of the DeMille team led by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future general president, Andrew Jackson. Also in distribution are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom, and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours it draws in some places, but it behaves with some great fighting scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
