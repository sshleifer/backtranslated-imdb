- I did not want this to get complicated, Leese. I have to assume she will read it. Fear goes to 30,000 feet in this thriller of action, action. An overnight flight to Miami quickly becomes a struggle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her hairdresser (Cillian Murphy) intends to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot. As the minutes tick off, she is in a race against time to alert potential victims before it is late. One of the many reasons I like this movie is due to the chemistry of the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people keep flowing in each other ... I handed both of them to make a movie like this. Especially the character of Murphy .. Jackson, who seems to be really complicated in acting so charming and innocent, still tries to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally captivated. I mean, in some places, he really seems concerned about Lisa. A ride full of excitement to the end. A lot of movies that I would not like to see a prequel or a sequel, but I really would not mind a prequel to this, which would be with Jackson on Lisa's supervision. The favorite scene is probably that scene of the headbutt button, because it was so unexpected. There was also this beautiful accumulation at the famous "pen" scene. When will it make her move? There has also been a nice change in Lisa McAdam, where she has changed from being the victim to the fight. I also liked the scene in which she sits in the food yard and pretends to ask some ladies a survey of the food yard. How wonderful was Murphy, totally stiff .....
