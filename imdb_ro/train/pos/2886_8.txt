Cinderella is a beautiful movie, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it's one of the best movies in the 1950s. I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly. You can see the cruelty of the Cinderella steppes and cetaceans, the Cinderella's sweetness. Mice are fun and sweet. I think they changed the story a little, but I think it's forever. It's such a beautiful movie, and I do not think anybody would hold it off. <br /> <br /> I'll give you a 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it is certainly a classic one.
