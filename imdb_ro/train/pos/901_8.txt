Well ... Vivah is a good movie, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not very good. The high point of the film is direction, music and Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film starts from a common factor in the Indian film: - A girl who is not loved by her mother. The story is the movie is a bit common but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. The minus point is the common story of Bollywood. In general, I would say it is twice you have to look at the film if you want to see the typical Indian values ​​of the family and love the course!
