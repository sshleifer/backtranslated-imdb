Okay, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has an extraordinary story and a plot, as well as great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hot and is perfect for the role! He is great in Hollywood. Has a bright future ahead! This performance took a long time, because I like this show very much and I hope it is very successful! It's so exciting. I've waited for 6 or 7 months and it's finally here and it's great! I have a tape. I can watch it whenever I want it now! Too bad it's only once a week, though. I would have wanted to be at least twice a week, because now I want it to be Tuesday every day! I hope you enjoy this show! Ashley ~
