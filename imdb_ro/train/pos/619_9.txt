I anticipated this movie as decent and possibly clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I have never heard of him so far) has played an incredibly good man; he was so serious and romantic, I and my friend who saw the movie with me, fell in love with him totally. Claire Danes, who liked me before (LOVE her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy it even more. Her act was fantastic, I could not say she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, casting was perfect. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were just as well; DeNiro as a homosexual pirate ... invaluable, invaluable. I laughed so loud in that scene where Septimus comes to the ship ... Oh, my God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her like the mumbled mother in Hairspray. But she had a good amount of melodrama and snap comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it was fun (but not stick-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects were not quite common, but when they were, they were wonderful; the cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were well placed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who likes fantastic movies such as the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. He kept my interest all the time and I will buy the DVD when he goes out!
