This movie is incredible. If you have a chance, look at it. Although, a warning, you will cry your eyes. I do, every time I see, and I hold it and I've seen it many times. Performance is remarkable. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you've seen it, keep in mind the interesting use of shadows and light. The home theater is a phenomenal film, and I miss it 10/10 - for true - thanks to the excellent actor, an amazing plot and heart dialogue. Very tense, very moving. It does not give all the answers, but it does many good points about humanity
