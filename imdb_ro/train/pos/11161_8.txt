This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think people around the world can identify themselves with "Frank" and his thoughts to a certain extent! These thoughts are extremely fun and women will also enjoy this movie. I'm sure all cast members perform well and this movie could have been a terrific blow across the globe if it were made in England or the US. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are looking for a treat! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
