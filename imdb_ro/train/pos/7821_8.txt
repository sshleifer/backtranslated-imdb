Very rarely, Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and comes to think of it for Kevin Kline and in this case, it must be one of their best movies. It's more about the film about how strong friendship may be more than Steve Biko's story, though we understand what the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to keep the name of the man and let the world know what a corrupt, deserted society, South Africa was. The direction is remarkable from David Attenborough, as it was for Gandhi, although if there is any criticism that could be directed, it could be at the length of the movie. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit in a historical movie. What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extracts. Thousands of people in both movies. This film opens your eyes to what happened before the separation of the Aparthitean, and you can not move from it. 8 out of 10.
