This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or frightening images, but always powerful. Cats riding and drinking from a water elephant, a circus with a bird that consumed the sky, and the pigs eating their own fried meat - that's just the beginning. Scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that requires re-tracking. In addition, the DVD includes an amazing commentary by the director, who, given the highly reserved dialogue, improves viewing. The commentary provides some scenes performances, but also offers invaluable quotes about Cat Soup crafting as follows: "Well, the artists wondered what we had to do in this scene, but I did not know, so it's hard to say why it turned out the way it did "(a wrong paraphrase). Also, the sound throughout the movie is very high quality, very accurate, and very moody. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows: <br /> <br /> First view: watch the DVD without comments. Second Watch: Watch the DVD with the comment. Third watch: Rewatch without comment. Once you've followed it three times, you will not stop there ...
