The best-selling book on honor crimes in Jordan is retired by its editors, after the allegations show that the story was made; associated with other accusations of his author's past as con-woman. A few years later she returns to the surface, accepting that she has obtained a certain dramatic license, but she wants to co-operate with a filmmaker to prove the substance of her accusations. What follows is a fascinating perspective on a pathological personality, someone whose behavior does not make sense unless what she says is true but apparently incapable of saying something that is not surprisingly dramatic but not proven in best and most often verifiably false. It's almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri hopes to win by appearing in this film: justification? celebrity? - all he accomplishes is to project a certain image of himself as a deeply injured person, and even that can not be taken at nominal value. Director Anna Broinowski appears more and more in the room as her film progresses, and increasingly excited to spin; but is finally rewarded with a remarkable, though terrifying and disturbing story, and one of those films that reminds us of what a weird world we are living in.
