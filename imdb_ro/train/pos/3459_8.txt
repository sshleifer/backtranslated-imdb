Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was a negative Columbo character. Columbo's first "own" episode, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from classical. Jack Cassidy interprets Ken Franklin, a half of a crime mystery writing partnership. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no talent other than the Gobi's gift and a book promotion ability. As soon as Jim decided he no longer requires Ken's marketing skills, Ken makes a plot to kill Jim. Apart from the fact that it is not a new plot, it is actually the real life story of a crime story originally intended for one of their books. I do not take a long time to Columbo to find that Ken is the killer, though unfortunately another crime has to take place (Ken novels and then kills a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to get a conviction. Nothing is wrong with "Murder By The Book", but it's not quite top-notch. I would just give Publish or Perish the edge of this: Both episodes present Jack Cassidy and the world of publication, but "Publish Or Perish" is a more tense and unpredictable fraction. But this is still a big episode.
