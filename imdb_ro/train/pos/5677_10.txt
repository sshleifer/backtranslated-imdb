The third and, in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. The only downside is that there is Lord Percy who was the funniest character in the previous series, but Prince Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is really bad. As a package is quality through and through convincing sets of regency, gorgeous cutting sarcasm and some pieces of the lost, the "macbeth" actors that stand out and Prince Georges' lucky chick impression "lucky" and the missing words in Johnson's dictionary . <br /> <br /> Some comedies were both intelligent and funny, but strange observation or lashes become strange, but especially a scream.
