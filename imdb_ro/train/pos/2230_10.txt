I've been searching for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was broadcast on television in 1983. All I remember was that it was a teenage girl alone who survived a plane crash AND survived the Amazon. I remember people searching for it (the family) and she knew how to take care of herself - she tells the story and I remember her very well knowing the bugs were under her skin. I do not remember anything about this movie and I want to see it again - if it's the same - and if any of you have a copy, can you send me an email at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be curious to get a copy to see if it's the same movie I remember. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I had passed through my own problems and this movie had a strong impact on me. Thank you in advance!
