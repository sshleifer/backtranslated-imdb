The man about the house is a true comedy in every sense of the word. Comedy refers to a character called Robin Tripp (played by great Richard O'Sullivan), who is after a wild party, ending at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was ordered to say goodbye to their old compatriot. Obviously, it happens to happen as it moves. The man about the house was a pre-cursor for Cooke and Mortimer, which was featured in the George and Mildred show, featuring the two characters who owned Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would turn out to be the man's headline for the house with Mildred (the longest and much missed Yootha Joyce), especially getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-usual character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always confused and ever came to want to borrow something (and never to return it). a version called three companies, but it does not have a chance compared to this original much more fun. Thames threatened to produce a comedy about a man sharing a 2-bedroom apartment in a very conservative time, but he should worry because evaluations at that time suggest that about 20 million people wanted to look a bit of inspired casting comedy and a sharp script. Which modern comedy can not reach that high standard. This program is available on DVDs
