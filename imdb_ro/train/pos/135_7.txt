It was an excellent piece for the series of dolls because this film showed all the series, from one to seven. And it was about a woman trying to stop the new doll master because I'd never guess the puppets would be in pain. In addition, I showed some series of master puppets that I have not seen and I see so bad as the second part. He showed an appearance of the torch that can turn things and people, which is cold and showed the return of the puppet master in the first part. He also showed a bit of aliens from the 4th, who was also cool, showed other episodes of people who could be good for them and did it. Therefore, thanks to this Master of Dolls will be a great success.
