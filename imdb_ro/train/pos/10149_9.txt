A cute funny story of 2 people who cross the paths as they prepare for weddings. The former police writer and public school teacher crash into each other in this new job, even if they marry other people. Perhaps a small point of view by the fact that "partners" are both A-personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. It's not hard, but it made me smile. And hey for the boys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the throats - you sell the sixth story, everyone wins!
