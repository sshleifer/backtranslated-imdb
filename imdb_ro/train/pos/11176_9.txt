Okay, I must first point out that when I first saw this movie I was 9 years old. If I had seen it two weeks ago for the first time, I probably noticed that this is just another horror movie made with cable TV, with some well-done scenes. But when you are new, you do not care about these facts. This has scared me the hell since then, especially those Zelda scenes mentioned above (and I still do). Nowadays I hang on this movie. I have to see this once in a month, and every night of this year I look at it with a pack of 12 beers and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I agree with those people who said that the action here is quite unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby looked as if I wanted Louis and Rachel to look, but you can not see too much devotion or feelings on the faces of the two. Hughes and Gwynne save the scenes that "creeds" respect. What I'm saying about this is that there really is no other movie that has no resemblance to Pet Sematary and I do not want to say zombie stuff here. The atmosphere of this film is indeed a noble and one of a kind. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks superficially like a cable TV but leaves you with a snarl, compared to the best horror coolers out there? Okay, I canceled a few minutes ago, but I have to say that all the pieces at that level are acting too much for perfection. But tell me if you really know a movie like Pet Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead here ... this is much more compared to intelligence than those things.
