The barman guided in some way the wind blows while playing a song dEUS. Anarchy pronounces on a logical and common thought. The story behind this movie goes just like the wind blows. And it can be really refreshing to look, if you're ready and willing to be. Visitors who say there is nothing to keep the story lines together are correct. Who the hell is anyway, Windman? However, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a wonderful, lively place, and Any Way captures this feeling. It also captures deception, racism, bureaucracy, addictions and violence that persist undetected in an apparently friendly city. The film is fun, fun and deep. The bartender debut screen will not have such a big impact as his musical debut. In this light, some may be disappointed. But again, "Worst Case Scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for any kind of wind blowing.
