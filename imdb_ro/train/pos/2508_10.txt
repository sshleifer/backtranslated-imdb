This movie is amazing. The part was just ... wow. I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde after I grew up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) comes over a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers from the fact that he is forced to live from others, the half-life of a vampire. It's a sad movie, but it's not a monster. The land was very unique and contrary to the typical vampire movement. The story was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing. The only blame I would say that had the film, despite the lack of a happy ending - though quiet - would be more languages. I had the unassisted version (I'm lucky to understand that everything saves a part of Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. Overall, the movie was great.
