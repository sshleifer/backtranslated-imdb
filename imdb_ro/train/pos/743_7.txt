This work is striking in describing the teen's life exactly when it was executed. Although this is a broad generalization, the parents of those times were too absorbed by themselves to be true parents, and those who were at home tended to be too distracted by the real problems in which their children were concerned. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us how to give up, even when it's painful, and does this with a sweet, melancholic, but informed way that Foster speaks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I liked that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie, in fact. The transition from the funeral to the wedding was meant to show that life is going on and so must we. Baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and overcoming them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass, and we have to go through them at better times. The whole metaphor of "motion on," and the procession of life, is present throughout the film and serves to give hope in the end. I like this movie, although I do not see it often because it tends to make me melancholy. It should not be seen by young children, and perhaps only those raised in the 1970s - 80s would like to do so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
