Madhur from CHANDNI BAR has begun making real movies, which some have called dry. He did SATTA, which was another realistic film, though filmed, but a great movie. the film formula he's flopped <br /> <br /> He's back with superlative PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that draws inspiration from the lives of journalists and is a brilliant film <br /> <br / > The film is well reported, although the half-baking Romantic portions of Konkana could be avoided but forgiven. The entire Upendra Limaye track is superb <br /> <br /> while the Kulkarni Atrium is very large <br /> <br/> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends is funny at first but sometimes repetitive Bikram- The country is brilliant and so is the whole hospital scene and also the ultimate child abuse that shocks <br /> <br /> The film has an open open end that is beautifully manipulated Madhur is doing a good job Music is okay < Konkana excels as Mad havi, using her expression at the best Tara Sharma is decent except his voice Sandya Mister is good as usual Upendra Limaye excels in his role as a policeman, one of the talented actors Unfortunately it is not well used today Atul Kulkarni is also good his small part Boman Irani is detained and doing a wonderful work rest are fine
