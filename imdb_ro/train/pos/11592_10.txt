My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing boat and said that the movie he was most impressed with and which remained in his mind, all these 39 years is the movie Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked if it would have been possible for me to get this for him. I'm sure many things go wrong because he only has 3 hours of daylight and he's been on this ship for three months and will have another 3 months before the expiration of his contract. Because we have Indian blood, he connects to this movie. On January 27, he will be 47 and I would like to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and, as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
