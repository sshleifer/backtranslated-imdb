What could be more than the idea that private detectives get involved with the women they should spy on? And most of the dialogue as it is written is perfectly banal. But actors turn the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the unreal lines. And the direction is wonderful. Each scene does exactly what it has and ends without being dragged too far. I have shown this to many friends in the mid-1980s, because I was puzzled by the way such bad material could be done in such a good film. Friends also liked it.
