I've been watching a lot of cool episodes of premieres (especially now that the Amazing Race is coming, but that was one of the best examples of writing and action I've seen from Bruckheimer's house. especially the younger officers, was on the scene, and the script and editing, the soundtrack and the act made this episode a force tour. If I were the producers, I would present this episode for Emmy, the portrait was made by Coop and Jimmy within the episode of 48 minutes, which makes many talented people do their best. I hope there is a prior warning when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I will notice much that I do not I noticed the first time.
