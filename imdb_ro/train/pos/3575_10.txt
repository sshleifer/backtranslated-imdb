Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I simply cried. Rlen's role, Glenn Close, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's domination. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duvall, Joe. The story describes a rural family dealing with the accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy," that is, he was so distracted and overwhelmed by what he did, became emotionally paralyzed. Then to the end, when the character of Jason Presson, Arnold, left everything to a stranger, I was so frightened for him that I actually thought of some terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with its character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs DO NOT add too much to the movie. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic brother, Andy, as a bastard who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a madman who hit Arnold around frustration with her own merciless problems and blaming her for her troubles. I could not be sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to marry together, he did not. Both did not deal effectively with their problems. They did nothing for the film and they were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as grandfather, touching that he was the only person who showed Arnold any attention. I felt that his role should have been elaborated. Players only did what they considered appropriate and sufficient. However, I liked it so much, so I actually smiled and wept tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans were a family again. Actually, I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
