I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment! Powers Boothe offers stellar performance. As a fan of some actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann ("The Academy", 1981), I never thought an actor could capture the "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie surprises the best show !!!
