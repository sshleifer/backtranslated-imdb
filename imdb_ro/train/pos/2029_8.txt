As a horse loved one can not appreciate this movie. There are some movies that show the ride, as it does. I'd love to know if Brian is doing his own movie trip. He would also like to know if they enjoy horses. Brian was in many movies where he traveled. Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is hard for me is that riding scenes are always full of tilting, as a horse can always run at full steam. The camera is the first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse. It would be very interesting to know how this movie was broadcast to find all the very good riders.
