Living in (some) colleagues. Of course, artistic licenses have been taken, but some of what you have seen in this film continues in some colleges. I went to colleagues in Southern California, where races are spreading pretty much with theirs. It's funny, because they are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc. and I can honestly say he is there. But the thing is when the class is left or when it's just waiting to be in the class, they (the students) seem to cling only to people of their race or ethnicity. They were? Not realy. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended, she once wrote about it: "we should try to spread ourselves with the students of other ethnic groups and try to get to know them." Otherwise you will create your own segregation. Racism certainly existed in one of the schools I attended. Once someone put brochures around the camp talking about the glories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing has happened like the incident in the movie in which the young Caucasian left and started shooting in a multicultural gathering. I can only hope and pray that this will not happen. > So is "higher education" too dramatic? Exaggerated? May be. Is that so? Depends on where you went or from school. The race thing in which the ethnic people are just spinning around with theirs is happening. Minus the exaggerations from Hollywood, the work on the race has come pretty close to me at home.
