This movie is simply incredible! I was expecting something very different from the movie I saw. However, it is very insightful in showing the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its relation to the behavior of animals. Allow me to warn those readers of this article, who are easily offended by too sexual content, because the explicit sexual nature of this film resembles a kind of pornography. It even has a scene that is very close to rape. Meanwhile, I suggest to see this rare work of "sexual art." Every minute of the image inspires the sex of the seventies, by the way. You do not have to forget how the times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go to see! It's worth the money and the time!
