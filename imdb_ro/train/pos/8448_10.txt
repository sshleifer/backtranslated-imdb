I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life on the Streets," so when I heard it was a meeting film coming, I could not wait. Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone back, but the greatest pleasure was for Andre Braugher to come back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss has always been the strongest part of an extraordinary show.
