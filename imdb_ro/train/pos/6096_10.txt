I know from a technical point of view this is not the biggest TV show ever, I mean it was shot on video and its limitations show both in the audio aspect and in its visual aspect. The actor can on time be a bit crumby.but, looks so much.it scared the fuck out of me when he first broadcast in 1988. Of course it would have been 5 years old.but I recently purchased the DVD the first 3 episodes that unfortunately I heard is now deleted.and they also heard that Warner will not release again because of the poor DVD sales. Also, the TV show did not have the same feelings as movies, in fact I thought it was more sinister, although the color palette is similar to the nightmare on Elm Street (both the movie and the TV show were made the same year ), this has a more serious tone, while the movies were becoming more and more full of sardony and joke. freddy as crack.but wise clown I think it was the power of this television show, you did not have freddy popping up every minute utes cracking a joke before and after he kills someone. in fact, this has more than one dream feel to him, strengthened by soft focus of lense.im I am not sure whether deliberately by the performers or just the limitations of being filmed on the video. I love this show, and not taken as a movie play can be very enjoyable much better than anything on TV today.
