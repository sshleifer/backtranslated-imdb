A long film about a very important character in South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before the usual time. The old film does not show how important Biko was, which really represented it. His life and teaching are reduced to little, at best, some wisely remarks. The film since 1987, the goal was to push South Africa over the threshold that would have led it to release. So, the film aims to show how irrational South American apartheid supporters are in 1987. To show this, the film must look beyond Biko's death, so focusing not on Biko but on a journalist liberal white man and his absurd escape in which he lives. His escape is necessary because of the victim's victim, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book about Biko after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this mode to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has a long age because it does not show South Africa with no historical distance, the distance that took place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and is called forgiveness, provided those who want to be forgiven to speak will go out . The film is strong and emotional, but the very historical limit makes it quite weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Pan-European books or films all have these flaws: they look at the person they should portray from one point of view. This explains why the movie has grown so old, seems to come a long way, as if nothing had changed at all. It takes a remake.
