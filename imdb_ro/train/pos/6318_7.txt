I tried to rent it on several occasions, but it was always with my girlfriend, who as a general rule usually rejects movies and whole comedy with the comment "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the state of spirit for that film. "Thus it enters into the" Almighty Night of the Almighty Film "! Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood a pretty good film. Finally quite forgetful, he has moments of fun and some laughs moments strong. I was not familiar with the fact that he was a remake and, as a general rule, he is watching films that try to ignore this fact and pursue their merits anyway. George Clooney puts a humorous and short coke as a safety cock on wheels, which for the most part left me to ask two things ... 1. It would not be better for every comedy if Mr.. Clooney has put a vague 5 minutes? and 2. How do fake tattoos look old and discolored and how easy can they wash? The distribution, all the full-fledged actors, has done a great job and you have the impression that they have had a good time together, which is quite important in a movie like this one. Needless to say, it does not go as planned in both the plot and the humor, but it has made me examine the special features and consider viewing the original, so I think it's a success! Rent it for a good time, maybe take some friends and a pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear Paolo Conte appreciated for a long time, and he left me screaming fragments long after the credits rolled.
