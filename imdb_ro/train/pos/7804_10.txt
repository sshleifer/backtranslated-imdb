I always look at this movie over and over. I have to look at him at least once a week. I'm from Africa and looking at that movie, I learned a few things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for the people in their lives. I wish he was my brother. I also saw and love Mississipi Masala. What a thrilling situation. When Denzel tries to get his brother in the office, he reminds me of my age when my brother was always mad at me to take care of me all the time. My brother always took care of my old father and wants to see me the same. How did Denzel make that African accent in the Cry Freedom movie? I saw the first film in Africa and I did not know then that Denzel was American until I moved here.
