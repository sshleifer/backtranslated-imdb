Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are the sequel to Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Their fake journey is almost immediately after the first movie and is just as good for a job if it's no good to entertain the spectator. Complot is a bad person in the future trying to kill Bill and Ted using bad robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they have to compete with the gruesome saber (death) and bring their lives back to normal. The actor in the film is up and even thought he's a bit weird at times, especially Bill and Ted's conversations, is a great movie. Rockers from Wannabe have made another great movie. Choose this next time at the blockbuster!
