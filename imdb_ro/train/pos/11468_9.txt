I'm really surprised at how little was done in the movie about the Columbine massacre. There is no major document, very tangled. Luckily, we enjoy the talent of Ben Coccio, who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made ELEPHANT as fine. Two different events that share the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something tangled and unknown ultimately about the motivations of the two killers and what actually made them carry their fantasy in horrible reality. ZERO DAY, supposedly made of video tapes made by shooting and found after the event, is absolutely riveted. Even if you know where it goes, you still have the hope it will not "go there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is awful. The movie is wonderful from top to bottom, from director to screenwriter (not too improvised, though it seems very spontaneous), the two main actors and also the actors who support them. There is only one aspect of ZEROZI that has troubled me. Okay, so we can not understand why the bishops would do what they did, but certainly one of the taxpayers was their ANGER. However, these boys do not seem angry. They might say a few things to show they are, but in fact they did not convince me they had NEVER inside them that forced them to kill innocent people. But that still leaves me feeling "why?" that director Coccio wants me to be. However, rent or buy this movie, it will drop over you and stay with you for a long time. People in BLAIR WITCH might only want the kind of success these guys have done to make a mock documentary.
