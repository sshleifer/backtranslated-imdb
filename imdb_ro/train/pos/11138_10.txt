Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's brutal, painful and realistic, but very fun. Top performers, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will continue to become Oscar-winning actors, offer stunning performances. Voight, Texas bastard, Joe Buck, who migrates from the small town of Texas to New York City to become a hustler. Do not apologize for the chosen profession, but it's not that easy. The women in New York City, such as the rich lady interpreted by Georgeann Johnson and Cass, played by Sylvia Miles nominated for Oscar, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck tries to escape his past life in Texas. She was raised by her grandmother, Sally Buck, performed by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. New York City locations are wonderful to watch the relationship between Fatso, played by Hoffman and Buck's characters, evolving into a friendship between men and men. Men are struggling to survive life in New York by not playing by rules such as getting a real job. As the movie evolves, Buck's past gets to the surface and is haunting but not clear. The film is not for children, but compared to today's movies and television programs, midnight Cowboy might be more popular. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can not forget. It's also a tearjerker of a movie, so get out hankies out too.
