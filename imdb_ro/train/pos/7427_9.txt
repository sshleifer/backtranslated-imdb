I saw the trailer for this film in the 70's when I was only 16 years old while watching another movie. Oh!!!! how enthusiastic about me and my best friend. I could not wait a month until it happened. I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theater. I love, I love, I love. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is brash and quite trashy, but also shy and uncertain with Babs and is so bold to look again. When she always plays green in the studio and lights up with a full voice, so different from the perfect notes from her, but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way she looks at her and she is so proud. We could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like we had the long sweater and the cap that was the same as the one he wore. this came to television on time and I received my daughters to look at teenagers and they loved it. Perhaps I was so caught up in this at a time when everything was extreme, I do not know. The end is always delaying even today.
