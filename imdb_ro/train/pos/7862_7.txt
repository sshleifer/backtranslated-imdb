Here's proof why Mary Pickford was America's Lover. In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of a squatter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "toppers". Scenes in which a kiss and love fall in love are simply delightful. She even wants to get drunk. That Mary could take this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to its diminutive state (5 '). Tess has to face the many physical and emotional challenges. She does this with the vagabond not seen in many time heroines. Tess packs a pair and does not want to fight anybody. Why she agrees to help the daughter of the "hilltop" be beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford is almost wonderful. <br /> <br /> Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply awesome as a negative character. The scene in which he manipulates a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or anything else) on the screen of the movie. If Forrest Robinson (interpreting Dad Skinner) wore a beard, would he have been a match for the model used in World War II, recruiting Uncle Sam's posters? I wish you! Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at first, it is worth investing in your time to see the pure "American" play. The film highlights the choices available to everyone, which implies that someone else is happy and what it means to be a true Christian. Recommended.
