Robert Siodmak is doing a fabulous job with this B movie featuring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does it, I could add without much help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and Tone. It's Raines all the time, a beautiful, tied actress who, for one reason or another, has never reached the status of some of her new "counterparts". Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadow and music is truly remarkable as he deals with this genre. Umbrellas, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the movie takes place in a nightclub with a very young rifle by Elisha Cook, accompanied by a delighted Raines. It's this scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to a new territory. Siodmak's commitment to the material is composed only of Raines, who gives a sincere interpretation as a woman in love trying to save her husband. Franchot Tone called this phone. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die and did not seem happy to have lived. And, except for a brief moment in prison, he seemed to be in love with Raines. The funny thing about many of these movies is that, as World War II progresses, interest in psychiatry has deepened. But, often, terms have been misused in movies such as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". The tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has a paranoia attached to his disorder, but seems to be closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by headaches, he could have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain. Phantom Lady does not have the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
