First saw this jewel from Joe Sarno back when, and I have to say that after seeing her, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the movie was moving a bit slower than I expected for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer made it in, the first time I saw her anywhere, I got up and noticed. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spice on every scene she's involved with. I've seen most of Sarno's films and the other Jennifer Welles movies, and I have to say that Sarno and Jennifer were both the best guys. Sarno's direction in this adult domestic drama is superb, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) a acting acting that makes this happen. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (alias Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both frequent Ms. Welles co-stars, as well as the frequent stars of Sarno's work, turn into credible performances as a pair of adventurous and yet normal housewives. This movie is classic Sarno.
