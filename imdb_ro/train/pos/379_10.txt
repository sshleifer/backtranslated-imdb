1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even wonderful - but this lacking on a gong went a long way to convince fans that the Oscar is little more than a hood ornament for good party members. > 11 nominations and not one title: this was the scorn of the Academy for one of its greatest directors; and one who had to wait another eight years before any prejudice prevented him from giving him the statue before giving him 7 for Schindler's list, which probably is not as good (and half Polish ). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I will not beat "Out of Africa" ​​(who won that year); but in my mind there was a class behind this: an epic tale of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big rage. Perhaps it was gorgeous music or cinematography (the sumptuous), but rather simply the actress: Whoopi, who proved to us all that it was much more than a comedy; Danny Glover, whom I have never heard before; and, of course, Oprah. The rest is history; but at that moment: who knew?
