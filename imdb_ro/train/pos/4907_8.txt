A well-done and imaginative production, truly clich√©less, this story somewhat picaresque tells a story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in lesser conditions than the ideal: man, a condemned man who has escaped his youth for he's worth as hostage. Directed by Alan Gibson with a perfect sense of a balanced narrative movement, the film offers freshness in almost every scene as criminologist Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of conditional release was particularly unmerited, outlines a a complicated escape plan, but ultimately succeeded, after which his spontaneous nature reaches the forefront as he escapes to his childhood residence. Often, as he staggered into the songs or danced, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive, and while the police are approaching an inevitable confrontation, the tied pair is seen to be very similar in their responses to forms of (Lindsay Wagner), appointed to help a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn), who is in charge of prosecuting Steckert and his "prisoner." This is an incredible story, a quick and new adventure that takes advantage of Harris's performance of capital, fine transformations from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as a kid kidnapped with an appropriate capricious score contributed by Wilfred Josephs and Frank Watts' top cinema, with all the shootings shot in a beautiful autumn Ontario province.
