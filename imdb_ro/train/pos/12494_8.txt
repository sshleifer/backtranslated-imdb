Finally, an indie film that actually offers some big spirits! I've seen most of the horror movies coming out in ... Theater, Right-to-DVD, Cable etc ... and most suck ... a few can be tracked ... even fewer are actually good ... Dark Remains is one of the best. I recorded this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved her ... and my wife and I loved it! Without the name actors I assume that the budget on this movie was pretty low but you would not have known ... the movie looks fantastic ... the total role acts for the movie ... the story is good ... and the scarecrows are wonderful! While most movie makers focus exclusively on scarecrows, they often forget the story and character development, two things that help improve efficiency. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that that character and story are important. It develops both at the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters and, therefore, you are more scared when you are in danger. Watching horror movies costing anywhere from 80 million to $ 5,000 to do, I find "Dark Remains" one of the stones there. Check this movie!
