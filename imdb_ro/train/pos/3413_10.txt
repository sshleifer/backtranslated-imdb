I just came out and can not believe what a brilliant documentary document is. Rarely come out of a cinema in such astonishment and wonder. Lately, movies have become so much that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when he first came out and this movie is done to me now. I did not know anything about it before she came in and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you may feel that this is one of those delicate movies about an amazing triumph covered by top music and trying to be fully convinced of what tells a great story but then do not let us let's enter. Fortunately, that's not the movie. People tell the story! This makes it so good to capture every moment of their involvement as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is so much beyond the climb that does everything that goes through so much more tense. Touching the Void was also a good doc about climbing and showing intensity in an appealing way, but this movie is far more a human story. I just saw it today, but I'm going to go and I'll say this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
