I saw that just this last Friday at Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee's on Beverly. This movie had the most applause of all the movies tonight. Since two music videos were first opened, I did not know what to expect, since they were very fast and with great attention, I was not sure I was immediately ready for a short time. But to my surprise, I liked it very much. I thought that the main demon character was very good. I was so impressed with the performance I checked my name. I was surprised to see he was the Witchblade guy. It has become very good, especially since then! Whether he or he was given poor roles or was pushed by the director very hard for this short. The girl did a good job. I think it was hard because it was her first performance and she was so young. Dad did well too. There was a lot of nice cg stuff for a short, both for this and for the short game "Mexican Hat" that was also nice, but I enjoyed the most because it had the most deep and excited and I take care of the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was rather illustrating and dark! He dealt with real topics using a more imaginative approach to keep ADD people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just want to have seen the character of the demons and a little less to start, so I gave them 9 out of 10. Also, I think the final credits have gone a bit slow. Otherwise, it was beautifully told, directed and edited. The moment was very nice, with a complete change to the rapid editing of MTV throughout the day. More will come from this director in the future as well as the actor. Now I'll think of him as the lost actor, not the Witchblade guy.
