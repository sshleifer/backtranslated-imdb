I look at the Cold Houses because of the real life experiences described. It was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully manipulated, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well-developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to address, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of portrait and practically honest treatment has an influence on the population. of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am encouraged that 3/4 of those interviewed in the group under 30 years voted just like me 10. Get to the hard ones - I will always reserve the "best episode" place for this episode. Continue to take chances and accept my heart's gratitude.
