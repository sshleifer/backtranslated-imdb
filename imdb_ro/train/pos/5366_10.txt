I'm staying here in November 2006 and still can not help laugh about this movie. Arnold's best movies came about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All three are amazing. How much an Arnold paint in this movie will make you laugh many times. It seems surprisingly good for me in Predator and Totall Recall. They have done a great job in making futuristic scenes, as it should be in 2017, but you can not help worrying about the style of the 1980s on men and women in the crowd and normal TV monitors in the Man Running Studio, which we all know here in 2006, are on the way out with a flat-panel display and HD TVs. Also, the computer graphics of the "Running Man" game intro would not look so in 2017. However, the story is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie I wanted to get up and not care about the end, what I do with the movie today. I really think Arnold's performance is much better than he gave him credit. Now I would not have chosen him governor, but that's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic "stalkers" too, and I think producers do not try to overcome combat scenes. When the stalker's dead ... he's dead. It does not last 20 minutes each. Stalker scenes are fast and fun, but do not try to overlap it. I gave this movie on 10/10 and this comes from someone who does not enjoy many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphics you see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
