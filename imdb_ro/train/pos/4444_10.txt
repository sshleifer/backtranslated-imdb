Most horror enthusiasts in Italy seem to hate this film because it has nothing to do with the first two films of the Demons. And with the "Demons III" in the title, it would be supposed to be. The problem is that this movie was never meant to be part of the Demons series. Distributors only "Demons III" above the original title "The Ogre" to win the popularity of the other movie. The new American DVD release of this image has the title "Demons III: The Ogre," but the film itself just says "The Ogre". I do not know if the previous versions had the title "Demons III" on the movie itself, but this new version seems to be a little white lie. If you manage to pass the title "Demons III," you can enjoy the "The Ogre". Start with an intro creep, and it remains pretty late throughout. There are no gore and movie movies slowly, but I still dig it. Just do not expect it to be like the other Demons movies. They give it "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
