The film was completely awesome and cool. The graphics were superb and it was amazing. In particular, Flik was gorgeous and wonderful in the movie and was fun and was and was sometimes intelligent. Circuses are colorful and are superb in the movie. The locusts were also cool and cool in the film. Hopper was a clean and perfect character. Even Dot was cute. When the bird comes to eat garbage, the scene was superb and good. Even the last scene was great and great. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to crack high schools. When the ants build the artificial bird, the scene was good and beautiful, I should really appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
