The novel is slightly superior, and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, the quiet but gloomy humor that falls in the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the murder-child obsession that takes over part of the plot. If the film deviates from the novel, it tends to absurd. However, I do not want to suggest that the movie is bad in any way. It always shows that the part and story remain in the mind as a good "one". Some of the minor characters were stockists who could turn their hands on anything. It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
