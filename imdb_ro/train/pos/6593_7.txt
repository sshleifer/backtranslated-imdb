I watched this movie twice now and I think it's good enough for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of pre-Columbian Indians from South America to the islands of Polynesia through the fall of balsa bald. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and the crew as they select the balsa in Equidor and float with them in the Pacific River to gather in Peru. They are launching a 101 day adventure at sea, testing the power of their primitive ship, surviving only with the means available to locals of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
