Triad Shinjuku Society: Chinese Mafia Wars are unlikely to get distribution in outside film festivals. Why? Could your censors stomp a film in which police officers would analytically violate male and female suspects to make them speak (and the victims enjoy it) or to see an old lady with the broken eye in the skull? These are just a few of the shocks available to viewers about the story of ultraviolet policemen and gangsters. It makes Clockwork Orange, which has been forbidden for years in the UK looks like a Disney cartoon. If you see this movie? YES It's a fantastic and essential view for Asian filmmakers. Shocking moments are to illustrate what's happening in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the crazy ending in DOA, of course). Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike who works at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this movie outside of a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I did not stop you, try to find a Hong Kong version on the web because I'm sure it will come to that country.
