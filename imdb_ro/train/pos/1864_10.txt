I looked at Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What a wonderful and awesome young movie. This movie is a must-see for anyone who deals with how to overcome child abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington puts out a remarkable show as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex Alert - Feel well and tearful. The most unconscious moment is when he finally meets with his mother, who was taken from the age of two months. And one of the most courageous was when he ascended to his mother and an abusive sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and I just wanted to know about it a few years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
