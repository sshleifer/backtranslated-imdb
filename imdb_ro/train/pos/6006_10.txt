When I saw this as a child, he answered all my questions and removed any mistakes or misconceptions I had. It's easy to watch because it's animated, which makes it unhappy. It has no moral prejudices or "sermon" issues, so no one has objections to it. It is a pleasant film that simply provides menstruating facts in a soothing, "matter-of-fact" manner. I hope to show my daughter.
