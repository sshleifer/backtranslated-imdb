With the rapid interconnection of madman scenes in an asylum, mounting / overlapping images and vague interlaced narratives, this is a very hard-to-watch movie. It seems that a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or a porter in a shelter to be near his wife and can save her. But she is clearly upset, cluttered on the floor with a free expression, much of the time and fear, misery and confusion written on the face for the rest of the time. The filmmaker sometimes goes to her point of view and we see vague images about her in front of a pond that drowns a child or crashes into a drowned child. She is tormented by something. When the point of view goes to her or other crazy people, the director uses distorted lenses and such things, showing us what the crazy people see and then how they react. And the place swells with crazy people, laughing, hiding and in a case dancing frenetic night and day. At one point, the man tries to get his wife out, but the night outside the door terrifies her and returns to her cell. Gradually, man enters a nightmare in which he interrupted her in another attempt to steal it, and kills the doctor and many with her companions, and at all times the mad people laugh and applaud. When he wakes up, he is released and swept the floor. Some fascinating photos of the life, streets, 1920s of Japan.
