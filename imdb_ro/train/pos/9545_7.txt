I do not know whether to recommend this movie to the fans "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label a few things about this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" extraction. The concept is similar, editing is just as frenetic and quick - which is good because, apart from making the movie more dynamic, it hides some defects caused by low budget and other factors. There is much more gore, less eroticism, and in the case of Meatball, the transformation of the human being into a creature that is partly a familiar car called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by some foreign aliens . <br /> These little expensive cosmic space actually use human beings as ships for their gladiator games that they play with each other. They infest the body, somehow manage to put a crazy amount of mechanical parts into it apparently pulling it from nowhere and turning it into a killing machine targeting other Necroborgs. Their purpose is to defeat another stranger who is in another Necroborg, take him out of the body and eat it. Generally, the plot seems somewhat stupid and I did not expect too much, at the end of the movie I was glad. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, it's a low budget move, but it's still fairly decent. Do not expect too much from the actors, they are mostly not very good, but they can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the gorilla, some bizarre situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Though the story is not too original, it has some charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
