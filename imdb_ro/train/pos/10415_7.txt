Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are songs, each related to the same characters. Three times, Ahmad pronounces the absolute word "Timp" in the declaration of love addressed to the princess, answering his three questions at their first meeting. So strong is the impression it causes, that the princess will oppose Jaffar's three attempts to conquer it - through three successive blows: cheating, hypnosis, and memory. However, Jaffar holds what he describes as the three inestimable instruments of dominating a woman: whip, power, and sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanic horse, the Genie, the Genie, and the magic carpet. Genie offers three desires to Abu at their first meeting; three times Genie laughs out loud in the mountain keys, and three are his considerations about human fragility before they leave. Abu exceeds three obstacles in the Temple of Zori (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magic eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports it in time to save Ahmad and the princess, and the bow and arrow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three, and there is magic in this movie.
