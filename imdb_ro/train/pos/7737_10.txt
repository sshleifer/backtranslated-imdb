If you are so great as a fan of an author like me by Jim Thompson, it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted into film. This is not the case with Scott Foley in the performance of AFECT DARK MY SWEET. A classic, no-nonsense, sexually charged suspicious noir that closely follows and rewards the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward probably show the best performances of their career. And always the Bruce Dern phenomenon could have even penetrated him with him. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion goes beyond logic, and the double cross is never at hand. I have to see for all fans of the movie noir. **** !!!
