Although there were some tricky spots and some plot lines that were not exactly personal, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, except for Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were real to form, and the meeting scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and actionable as anything else for to grab the little screen. /> <br /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie," known as "Life Everlasting," is a fan movie, but it's on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer, and Yoshimura have done a wonderful job by shooting free seasons of seven seasons and each major member of "The Best Show on TV" together for the end of the series that NBC never bothered to give it. True to the "Homicide" form, there were no happy terms, like life. That has always put this show apart from the shows of the policemen who have lost their minds on television. Kudos for writers and casting to create something over the series and in the movie that caused viewers and television producers alike. ** I call myself a "Omicide Maniac" if for no other reason to keep my colleagues in a cooperative mood. **
