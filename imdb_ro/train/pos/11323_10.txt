Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by an h-game. In a nutshell, the producers made it make a success without any h-stuff. It could not have been otherwise, because character development is wonderful as imagined in this series, and any change to it could destroy perfection (you will understand once you see all the episodes). /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer has spent time presenting the characters), things get the rhythm fast and soon after the middle series, the action becomes so intense that you are missing out on the spot. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that took place in Fukuky in the last 50 years. The pilot actually begins with the end of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started in the last battle and surrounded much of the city. He unconditionally confesses a struggle between two servants who trigger his Reiju to call one of the most powerful servants of the Saber battlefield. His first contact with Saber left him amazed. "Such unimaginable beauty ... I was in a hurt for words." <br /> <br /> You do not have to compare this series to another to fully understand the plot. FSN offers much more than some sword struggles, good animation, spectacular lights, excellent soundtrack, great character and relationship development. Present the changes that take place in the personality of the characters, as it precipitates the events. The action reveals the dynamically credible emotional and behavioral patterns of individuals (not similar to those in the linear series) that constantly model their personalities to reveal under the mask of perfection the wrong characters. <br /> <br /> The Saber character is related to a medieval legend that has been altered to suit this series and should be accepted as such. You do not have to watch the FSN thinking it is not really the historic viewer, remember this is a series of adventures / fantasies and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes, I would have followed them with the same breath.
