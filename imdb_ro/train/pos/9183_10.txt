This wonderful BBC television production of 1983 (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classical love story "Jane Eyre," with Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the best version that was made so far, because it is Charlotte Bronte's most faithful novel, both in concept and in dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when film makers begin to mix with the blood of a classical life, then the classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of this "Jane Eyre" have approached the story with respect and faithfulness to the original, which results in a spectacular addiction that deserves to be seen several times, to enjoy the multitude of sweets, delight and suspense. The performances are delightful, the music is accurate, even the gothic design of the house and the outdoor photos are beautiful and set the right tone for production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, though easy, is that this version, like any other version ever made by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that created Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice but stay in Rochester after learning that she had a crazy wife and she was still married to her. "Oh, bring me a divorce," she'll tell her husband or live with him. But Jane Eyre knew he could not be content with this course in life and respected. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had learned since childhood, not from the Lowwood Calvinist brutal institution but from the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred and did not turn the other face. One day I would like to see that a version describes these influences in a less adaptation. A classic novel ending with the heroic writing "Even so, come Jesus!" it should not have the foundation of that belief from it.
