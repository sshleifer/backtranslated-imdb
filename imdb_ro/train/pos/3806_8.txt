This movie took my breath at some points, I just liked it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the character dialogs and the story could have been done a bit better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story of some guys trying to kill a dragon, it's gone nothing to him! <br /> <br /> The general design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes ... everything is just magic! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this movie. Characteristics of the characters were wonderful and funny. A bit Tim Burton is if you want. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a great design, presented in a simple but wonderful story.
