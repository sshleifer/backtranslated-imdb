Hood of the Living Dead had a lot of livelihood before the opening credits began. First, any game about "... Living Dead" invokes his sister, Mr. Romero, and instantly sets a high standard that many movies can not afford to aspire to. Secondly, my movie companion voiced doubt that any horror film would overtake Leprechaun Seminar In Hood. Skeptically, we set ourselves to look. <br /> <br /> I was rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good zombie movie. Of course, the budget is low and, of course, the amateur friendships deal with the distribution, but Hood of the Living Dead loves the zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it is so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE is together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. Prior to this planned escape, however, his brother is shot to death on a journey. Ricky's scientific mind presents a superior CPR or 911 option: injections of the experimental formula for the regeneration of his lab. Unfortunately, the little frog wakes up in an ambulance like a bloodbath in Oakland! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economical to eat enemies than revenge in a car, but again, I'm a poor judge of the complexity of urban life. (How Poor of a Judge? In response to a heavy scene involving four men, I expressed my shirts "Ah-ha!" White Everyone, so the blood is presented Economics! I used the same technique in my own "Jordan replied," No, this is the band dress, the white jerseys have been banned from bars in New Orleans for a while as a result. "Oh.) A lot of film is set in someone so there is a lot of hanging and waiting for the zombies but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere - it exceeds the budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Explanation: When man plays God, the zombies appear! Or, maybe: follow the FDA-approved test rules before human experiment! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the zombie canon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with a shooting. As for the current zombies , infection spreads with a bite as usual, but quite unusual headstands do not work - there are heart shots that kill. Zombie has pulses, the absence of which proves true death. And these zombies make jaguar-frightening noises. <br /> <br /> Free zombie in-glum movie: A mercenary called Romero. Gemstones. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Zombie angry jaguar noise, of course!
