I met this movie as a 8-10 year old boy on a cold and dark afternoon in November. I was out of the game all day, frozen, and when I came around 16:00 I took a cup of hot cocoa and I sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not happy and bad - and it was, in fact, dark and moralistic. It captured my imagination. I'm sure he misses the text and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the purist Tolkien. But it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to bear a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfishness, disturbing decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaint. But the only place where this movie stands out clearly above the new movies is the vocal characterization. John Hurt is great in this. If you do not like the way the character is drawn, look at it and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I have seen it again many times and often I always return at that moment as a child thirsty for a magical adventure. For this reason I say "lucky", the film is nostalgic for me, so I overlooked its deficiencies. But, between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, I approached and I still have.
