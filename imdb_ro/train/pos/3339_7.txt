Brothers Farrelly, Bobby and Peter are at him again. With "Fever Pitch," the creators of other films that dealt with many rough themes, they dropped that tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's movie on the screen, which would have been hard to do. The novel, with the same title, dealt with the obsession of a man with football because it is established in England, where this sport consumes the majority of British sports fans. It is up to Lowell Ganz's and Babaloo Mandell's writing team to turn the book into a language that would attract the attention of most Americans when they make their hero, a fan of Boston Red Sox. Fever Pitch "is a film featuring an obsessive fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life revolves around the Red Sox season and is an eighth grade professor with unusual ways to involve students in the subject he is trying to When Ben takes four of his best students for a local business tour, he meets and falls hopelessly with Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who goes to places, but at the age of thirty he does not have a life of his own. The story follows the two lovers by taking part in the Red Sox at home games in Fenway Park. The fans of this team are probably the most loyal people in the world who are left with a team doing great things, but by 2004 he never won a World Series. In fact, the end of what I heard had to be changed because it was the year that eventually won the event that he had escaped by eight six and six years old Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple in the center of the movie. Mrs. Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises her in her appearances in front of the room. Jimmy Fallon, a popular television comedian, has become a film actor, has a better opportunity here than in his latest appearance in "Taxi," in our humble opinion. The Farrelly Brothers' film will also satisfy fans like baseball fans with this baseball story.
