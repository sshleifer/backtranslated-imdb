Ossessione is in a very bad state, but is currently undergoing a complete restoration at Copenhagen's Digital Film Lab. The material used is a secondary generation "Positive Master", originally from the printing that Visconti has managed to conceal from fascists. It was scanned on Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data), then processed using the DaVinci Revival Restoration Software. After that, the rest is manual work and we do not anticipate finishing before the early spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully it's released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that restoration efforts will be met by many future generations.
