A Chinese scholar who severely criticizes the arrogant, warmongering policies of a ruling moment around the pre-war Japanese emperor in Japan is accused of being "communist" and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who totally supports her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save his family from hunger. This film is a huge statue raised in the praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less sublime in the lead role and it was a monumental scandal that she did not get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. She went to a young woman with a very limited potential. <br /> This profoundly moving and most "human" feature is a necessity for all the "true children" on earth.
