Definitely one of the most spooky and twisted whoever I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were great and they kept me through the whole adventure. <br /> <br /> The very classic pieces and the props really give a sense of atmosphere to the process. Minimalist feeling works for the whole picture. My only complaint is not with the movie itself, but with the lack of a decent DVD movie widescreen edition. I own the fullscreen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to resist the full-screen presentation), but a wonderful Deluxe or "special" edition will surely get my money.
