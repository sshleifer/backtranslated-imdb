How beautiful to have a movie that the whole family can look at together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marries in Las Vegas in a whim and then not only have to break their children's news, but then they have to try to knit their households (each has two boys and two girls) into a cohesive family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two pre-eminent and two younger children, does one miracle at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. Fighting children (and a small affair of love between two of them) make us wonder if everyone will ever be able to understand. More exciting than Brady Bunch, which is a nice way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
