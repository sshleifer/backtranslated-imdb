People expect no less brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this film is no exception. Some of the movies I loved were not good at the box office, but, I'm glad to say, this movie is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad for then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I did not think Professor Screw Eyes or "Scary Cyrus" was too scary for the little kids (the audience targeted for this movie), but I figured out what happened to the terrifying teacher at the end was a little too dark, the movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and exciting classic I have loved for years.
