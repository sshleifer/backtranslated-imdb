New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, each segment having a duration of about 10 minutes. Shorts do not bind exactly, but they all have something in common, love. Each short is about finding love, be it a couple, or just two strangers sticking out. The film is an overall cast including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irina Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an exciting premise, I was expecting an extraordinary movie; the problem is that New York I Love You is not added. The sum of its parts remains. Some of the segments are fun, original and exciting, but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it's terrible. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. The story seems something some film students might want to do. After saying this, the movie has some wonderful moments, one of the best being the old couple segment played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, going to Brooklyn on the 67th anniversary of the wedding. And there are moments like this that made me a spectator, I want the film to be more coherent, because there is plenty of potential here. But as unsatisfactory as the whole story has come to be, for me, the cinema and the soundtrack saved everything. The editing was perfect, the way the shot was shot was very impressive, and the etheric soundtrack could not be more appropriate. Finally, New York I Love You feels an experimental film and, as in most experiences, there are high and low values. It's the way someone looks at the movie as a whole that will determine if they enjoy or not. It may be useful for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
