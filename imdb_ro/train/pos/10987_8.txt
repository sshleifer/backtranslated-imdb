Trawling through the Sci Fi Weekly News section of the local video store, I have lost the hope that I will find any good movies I have not seen yet. Hiring Cypher was like a punt on a horse, perhaps very limp. My son is so cursed by the current "B" Science Fiction that he has not bothered to see this yet. It should be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. She must have been very quiet or I lost her. Well, this was a very pleasant surprise! This is not a movie B. It is not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and does not attempt to be - more of a quiet film, which must be seen several times for its plot to be fully savored. The special effects are heavily presented when used - my only complaint is super helo is an obviously CGI leetle at first glance, but they are entitled to the second appearance, and that everything else is top notch. In any case, the conditions are secondary. I will not give anything about the plot. The structure of the plot has a Russian doll look, which reminiscent of the Basic Instinct (although with a very different content). I'll say Jeremy Northam's choice was a stroke. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this film strikes his ear as a kind of dialect in New England, is a tad-off key. See the final breath of the fence and you will see why it is such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also just with her "kiss me - it will shoot me" edge. I rarely watch movies several times in a few days - this is one of them.
