It has been so long since I saw this movie (at least 15 years old) and still haunts me with a vivid image of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war may face, despite the provisions of the Geneva Convention. A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts are captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mission to establish myself in a Japanese port. Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as any other burglary, but at their infatuation they soon learn from a friendly guard in the Japanese prison that they are judged as spies since they were not in uniform when they were captured. The consequences of such a crime, by the Japanese Martial Code, are executing by decapitation. Despite the reasons and advocates of the sympathetic watchman, the day of reckoning approaches a clock bomb. The tension is so high that you will actually hear bitching, though it might just be your chest kicking with the percussion of a tremendous execution team. The end is, in fact, too painful to reanalyze my head much less write it here. But I promise you'll never forget her. Good luck finding your video in the U.S.
