The movie was a long-awaited release, which was a bit disappointing because of the expectations we set up. When we look at it again, I have to say it's actually pretty good. First of all, it is very true for original history (of course, not complete) and as such is only done to preserve the right to the film. The history of the child's modesty is presented and is very true to the original. The actress may not be the best around, and the plot is a little thin, but when you compare it to Vitti's 1966 movie it's much better just because it does not try to be a musical. Generally, I would just recommend it to the fans of Modesty Blaise or to a person who's watching it on television.
