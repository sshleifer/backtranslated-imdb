Jimmy Cagney always follows you in this story of a scene producer who is struggling vigorously against future "talking" movies. This story of love, deception, women and dance is presented in such a story. so as a viewer, never be treated in a boring moment. Direction of table scenes in the rehearsal rooms was extremely well done. The story was not really lost at this frenetic pace. Some parts of the material presented here became little data, but it does not matter because when you look at it in a time frame 1933 it's fabulous to follow this alongside a bunch of other movie dragos that were released in that period. Jimmy Cagney is a sight for the inflamed eyes in this film, without losing his temper as always - the producer of previews for cinemas as an intro. In this way, he tries to save his ass from leaving the business, he was a broadway producer before starting this. Joan Blondell is fabulous that the neglected interest in love, Nan, she offers such an unusual performance to the movies of that time, so great to pursue a woman portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was the enormous production at the end. They were magnificent in themselves, beautiful choreographed and wonderful products, but they did not seem to fit into the story. The only link he has with the main story is that Cagney had to put 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls were repeating throughout the movie and that these sets fit into a cinema. In this way, "Sitting on a Backyard Fence" was more appropriate for the story. The productions at the end seemed to pull this frenetic break story and it was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first music sequence and then I realized there were two more. These sequences also have a lot of chic from the audience. <br /> <br /> Everything is a wonderful movie with a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
