The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that could have used a better action and direction (or at least music!). However, for the achievements of Walt Whitman, he deserves a 10. An earlier poster calls him on the film, but I think it's a simple case not to see the tree forest. Movie makers were apparently more interested in getting the story there than having a brilliant film from Hollywood. And for that, I applaud them - the fact that it is non-mainstream also reflects Whitman's life. This film is more documentary than for the sake of acting. Being fascinated by a story like this, when you rarely hear about these types of stories that shape the current mental health, is the most important thing. I found a very nice look on history.
