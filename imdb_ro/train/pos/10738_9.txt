SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC film.2 French filmmakers who are in New York to film the action of a NYFD are confronted with this event and take full advantage of it. Before 9/11, nothing really happens that gives the movie an even better script. On the day of the attacks, it seems to be just another dull day to work, but this will soon change. As a filmmaker goes on the way with the firefighters, he shoots the first crashing plane, this is the only record of the first impact. He travels with firefighters to the WTC and enters the building. The second plane crashes people understand it is not an accident. In the next time we see fireflies making plans to save as many people as possible, meanwhile we hear beaten sounds, these are the sounds of people who jumped from the tower and fell on the ground, this is the most demanding moment in the documentary . Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life, you hear his breath as crazy while he is leaking out of the building. Then a kind of sand storm breaks over him and the screen turns black he was very fortunate to survive, and now he can shoot the empty streets of downtown New York. Since this documentary has so many historical records, and because the film would be totally different, this documentary will probably remain in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks live at home because we had the afternoon, so this makes it even more realistic to look. 10/10
