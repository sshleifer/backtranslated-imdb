Ah, I liked this movie. I think he had everything. I've been laughing loudly a dozen times. Yeah, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this from a girl's perspective. I think it's a shame that he scored only 5.2 in the standings. Too many guys who vote? It was much more than other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman I do not enjoy all the chic movies, but I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be gorgeous and not as fun as they would be. But, as I said, this movie had everything, almost in my opinion. Great scenario, good binoculars, fine arrangements. Although the character of Eva Longoria Parker reminded a lot of Gabrielle of Disperate Housewives, but what? Was awesome. I'll keep this movie for rainy days, days when I feel low and I need a few laughs.
