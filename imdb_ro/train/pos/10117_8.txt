The story of a executioner, his sheep farm chief, and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it is still very interesting. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the landscapes I have known so well through other films in this region. This movie was the first time I ever saw the excellent Maria Regan, and since then I've been a fan of her. The film also contains Bruno Lawrence, which is probably best remembered by the American audience in "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper has a role as a ranch owner who pays too much care for his daughter's care (Regan). <br /> <br /> Strong action with unbelievable destructive performance from all driving. I first saw this movie in a highly edited form on late-American television, but believe me, the unexplored version should not be missed.
