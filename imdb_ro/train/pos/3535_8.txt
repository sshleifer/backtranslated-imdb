** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this game. I received it for Christmas after two months of falling from my parents. I'm glad I did that. First of all, I would like to say that the only player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in London, and some bad guys destroy it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. Of course you have to save it and it's big enough, but it should take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think it's the funniest part, is when you're in the jet-pack, and people hit Big Ben. Just equip the rocket launcher with the utmost confidence in the jet-pack and throw the clock and enemies down. Have fun! The rest of the levels are very good, but quite short. There are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that's one of the downs, because only the first two are actually fun and the last two to unlock are just "kill 25 enemies", I mean, mon ! We have enough points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are very bad! Multiplayer, myself and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no robots. Halo did not have any bot, but this is still some games of many fine players! You can be a lot of bad guys and you go against each other and you can set traps, which is the best way to kill people without realizing their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is a strange bad graph, but this is not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (does not need any comment, just great, you go to jet-packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (the only levels I'm back to are the Loondon level and Istanbul's part 1). I gave this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> It could have a little bit of improvement but it's still good.
