I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on TV. Actually, I anticipated seeing the movie when it was announced and more than my expectations met. I bought the DVD now and I intend to follow it every year. With the exception of "It's a wonderful life," I think this version of "A Christmas Carol" is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a superb casting run by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and ability to play any role, and keeps his character unique to himself. How can anyone be remembered like Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it so easy. The direction is wonderful with fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special sense of time, place and era described. You will simply love this movie and place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
