It is sad to see this movie now that we know how ANC has been eliminated by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing. Woods got a little. Yes, the apartheid was abolished, but the power apparatus was reserved by minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in the Shock Doctrine, in the talks between the black and white leadership, "the Klerk government had a double strategy. First, relying on Washington's upward consensus that there is not only one way to lead an economy, economic decisions - such as commercial policy and the central bank - as "technical" or "administrative." He then used a wide range of new policy tools - international trade agreements, constitutional and structural innovation programs for power plants adjustment impartial experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, the GATT and the National Party - anyone except the NCA liberation fighters ". The statistical results are terrible, there are not many changes and AIDS is flourishing. Watching Cry's freedom in this light is deeply ironic - actually tragic. ANC has turned out to be the primary problem.
