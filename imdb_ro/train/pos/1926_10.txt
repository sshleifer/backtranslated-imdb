In 1967 I visited the Elsinore Lake port of flight and flew with a yellow planet Pratt Read. Returning to Germany, the above series took place on television and one segment was about California high altitude flight flights in the early 1950s. (The real life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the series) It turned out that the film sail was the same (same number N) as the one I flew to Elsinore Lake. Since I've seen the segment I've been looking for and I wonder if it's available somewhere. (other segments in which they were serious were Seat Baker Ejection, a tool to find avalanche victims, etc.).
