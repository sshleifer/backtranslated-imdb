Usually, musicians in the 1940s had a formula - and if you studied movies you know what they are talking about - a certain length of time, very spectacular performances that were great on the surface but never entered the real personages of the characters and so on <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and the year's light is better and deserves the nomination for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although he did not have the chance to beat the eventual winner - Lost Weekend). /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the rain." This is different. He really enters his "wolf wolf" (at first) that "raising any girl during leave" is nothing more than a lark. And if you had to do a "story" to do it - so be it - until. A kind of musician when he gets his "foot caught in the door." The eventual animation of the film is mainly due to his attempt and his new pal (Sinatra) to make the "good story" to "get the face" that he is in real and unexpectedly falling in love with. You will need to see the movie to see what I mean. Besides the fact that there are so many other great elements in this movie, it's a classic story of a buddy, nostalgia at a time when the Second World War was near the end (the war ended at about a month after the release of the film), an awareness that a guy who is always laughing at life can find out that he is indeed a great human being, great songs, and perhaps some other elements of the classic movie that I can not think right now. Why not a 10? Almost at the end - at about 2 1/2 hours it starts to feel a bit long. There's a small number of ballet that Gene Kelly makes that was a sensation in 1945 but looks dated and feels it adds just a few minutes now. But as a whole, they are a clear winner at every level.
