Being from a small town in Illinois, I can instantly refer to this movie. Considering the era in which it was made, the city's inhabitants look uncomfortable like many people I grew up with. Yes, the plot is so. And yes, the act will not be nominated for an Oscar soon. But that's not the point. The idea is to suspend reality and have just FUN. And this movie has amusing Fun. From the greedy banker, lacking money to the well-known deputy on the contrary, this movie was made to have fun at the SciFi genre and the small town that lives for the best. Who can not smile at Enforcer Drone or Droid Vern? and I loved FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. Generally, given the technology at their disposal at the time, this is a pleasant pleasure in one's childhood, when you could go back on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in your hand, and laugh at the foibles of living small town. This is a movie that I will watch again and again, if for no other reason than to have fun with me and my little ways.
