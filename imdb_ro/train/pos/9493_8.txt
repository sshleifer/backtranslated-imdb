White Fire has so much for him. With Larry Bird showing Robert Ginty guilty of burning fabulous hair and super macho mustaches, the film rises above other low-budget actions. Tom Selleck's charisma looks like a jerk. With Ginty beating everyone, the movie just grows marvelously when a diamond intriguing story comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, front bumps, chain attacks, and some incurable themes ... this blow ends on all the cylinders. If you are looking for wonderful B-Actions, here is where you are. Now if I can get my hand on the soundtrack.
