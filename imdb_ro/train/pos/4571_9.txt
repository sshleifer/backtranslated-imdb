The most important thing about this film is Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor's brilliant performance as Christy Brown, the guinean artist and guy who, despite his physical condition, overcame all chances. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance has been shockingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy made of his low-income family, the Dubliners, encouraged her to make impossible, and this picture illustrated this support did not read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to surprise the arrogant personality of Christy Brown. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie lovers.
