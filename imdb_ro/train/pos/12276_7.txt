Such environmental production has failed to achieve its main purpose, which was to properly adapt Allende's novel? Obviously, yes. Bille August has managed to make a superficial superficial film in which the core elements of the South American mentality are presented only as secondary events, resulting in total incoherence. I can not believe there was a whole production team who could not understand the book! There is, of course, a technical quality in this movie and I think the actors did everything they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this was the most important part.
