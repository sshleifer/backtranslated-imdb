This movie made me so wonderful to watch at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find myself empowered. And I always find human and real characters. It is a film that shows the reality of life in LA noisy, recurrent search lights from the helicopter, which scans the dangers that lie so close to normal lives worn by characters. It is also a film showing how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you can make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intentionally or not, has strong repercussions. I have found this movie as similar in many respects to Robert Altman's Short Cuts. They both had a record of perfect actors and actresses dressed in stars and both films gradually lets you see how the characters are interconnected with each other and affect each other, for good or for bad. Grand Canyon has done a better job of providing a coherent message (hope to the desperate reality) than Altman's film, though I found both interesting in their own way. This movie is a definition you must see!
