This is a racist film, but worthy of study and joy. For the first time, the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed, quiet thing, which with her still home on the way to graduate high school, and he retreated and kicking back waiting for the inspiration to do something. The second time, you realize how horrible the sister's husband is missing from her friends in the blues bar. He takes it, it is the thing to do these days, and the critical moment passes as if he talked about weather. In the same scene, the blues song of the sister is a real tear, if you are less sensitive and like this kind of music. Her performance feels like the climax of the story; a story of blues with good boys being "black men" in their element in the forest, SC. Meanwhile, all the white whims of the film lead what seems to be meaningless lives that just fit children. It's wonderful, as long as you recognize it as a fiction.
