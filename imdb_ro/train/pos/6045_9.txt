I was in the movie too, but I do not know if they really made this scene. On the way to a school (in 2005) we stopped at a petrol station at the same time they were making the film, and we were asked (our whole) to run away and shout Go! Free Bird! I was around 10 years old, could anyone who saw the movie tell me if this part was actually kept in the movie, it would be great to know! I remember that I thought the movie never came out because it was two and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I guess it was a pretty good movie, I could buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
