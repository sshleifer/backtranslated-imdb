First of all, this is simply the funniest movie I've ever seen. It incorporates perfect harassment, sexual humor and intelligent stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something that we do not really see), which has given me hope there is love there, that two people who love one another can work through their adversity; and that such a comedy to take life (which I think we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing interpretation to Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will see more films from all those involved in the future.
