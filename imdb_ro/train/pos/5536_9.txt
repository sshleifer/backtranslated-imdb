Actually, I enjoyed this show. Even as a young man, I was interested in all sports, including horse racing. It will always be difficult to make a series of racing games and at the same time get permission from the race to record footage on this controversial topic. An episode that I especially recall about a horse expected to win a big race that looked a little colorful. A syringe was found on the stable floor, and everyone thought it was drugged, but nothing appeared in the blood tests. All too late realized that the horse was not doped, but the knee cartilage was removed. As if driving an oil-free car and the engine lit, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
