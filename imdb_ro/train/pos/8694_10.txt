It was in 1988, when I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a huge fan of Spitting Image (since winning the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded each show on tape and I watched it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie stood before an image of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said, "I need a shave." Or the funniest of all, when he played the ball with his dog - but the other way around! It is a shame that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion; was one of the most fantastic and smarter TV shows ever. Compared with other satirical shows, it was definitely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and I'd like to see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
