I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I certainly did not care about the opera at the time, but changed my mind. I loved this movie very much and I enjoyed a work since then. I really bought some CDs. Who cares about his acting skills, he actually played what was adorable. It was so charming, so charismatic; Frankly, I wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many criticize it so harshly. He was so right, he does not accept people to push him or judge him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed!
