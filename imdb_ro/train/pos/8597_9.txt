I liked this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that never happened before - a Secret Service agent goes bad and engages in an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison," they think he's the old man, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He is just a moral-erroneous agent who has an affair with the First Lady! Since he does this, he is not able to pass an acceptable polygraph exam, and that makes him suspect number one when it reveals that there is a plot for killing the president. "Garrison" is forced to go lam but at the same time still trying to do the right thing, protecting the President. Douglas does a good job in this role. I'm not always interested in the people she's playing, but she's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as the chief colleague of the SS who hunts Douglas until he is convinced he has told the truth. When he makes the two of them work together in the end to discover and then stop, if I can, the plot. The brethren are also interesting. I also have never - and unfortunately - never see a first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. This is just a blow to action that is trying to start. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them and one reason why you see so many critical comments. However, here it is unfair. It's simply not smart enough for the geniuses on this site. My advice: cool down, go together for a walk and enjoy all the actions and intrigues. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it becomes great entertainment notes ..... what is what movies are all about.
