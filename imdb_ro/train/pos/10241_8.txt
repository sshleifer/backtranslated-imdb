I'm trying not to get IMDb ratings at heart, but I was funny when I saw the rating of 5.4 at one of my childhood favorites. I'm not as amazed at age 17, but as a family film, it's a sweet and well-understood film. Children will surely love it and will not bother defects, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages of the film. None of the films have been preached in any way, in fact it has a big message that added to its sweetness. I will admit, however, that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes such as Screweyes' death (which still fights me) could be a daze on the scary side. But the animation is far above the media, with beautiful colors and good animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful and the song is memorable, exciting and funny. I liked the characters, Louie is probably the deepest of them, but the dinosaurs were at least engaged. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and excited, when he told Screweyes, "I gave up!" had me in the stitches. My favorite is Screweyes, though, an effective bastard who's hard and I think he's smart. But if I want something, the movie is kept partly when he explains how he lost his eyes and why he feared crows because he could have been more developed from the point of view of depth. The script, while not worthy of Oscar, has its funny and heart-warming parts and should keep children and adults entertained. The voice that seemed to me was what the movie did. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith had solid performances, but Kenneth Mars had a special mention because he was absolutely gorgeous like Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. Generally, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating, I honestly do not. Sure, this movie is not perfect and is not as good as a dinosaur movie, such as Land Before Time, but it's fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
