This movie is great. Simply. It's rare to find a comedy with levels and this is a good example of bleeding them. When I first saw this movie, as the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked, "Did you just get that?" For those doubtful, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! See the different characters, each jostling for the position, and if you see nothing else, see the connection between Vick's healing and the movie path. It's all in Vick's head! The opening line about Vick's world. The closure scene with the camera enters Vick's head and inside an entire universe! Corresponding, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
