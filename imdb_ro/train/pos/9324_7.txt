I've read some reviews and I'm pretty sad that a lot of story seems to be considered. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie, and there are just so many things that can be done in a movie - US or Canadian - or anywhere. Colm Feore is doing, at least for a "F @ g-Hag" like me, a great job to play not only the "gay" but also to play sick. I mean, the man really can not get much pale! However, you may never know the tape down from ... um, the end. If you need decaying, there are some SKing movies you might want. <br /> <br /> Being the daughter of a recovering Alchemist, druggie brother David Cubitt was the trick to me. I'll give it to him, he grew up fast and believe me good. And as an aspiring writer, moemes, I can see a lot of ideas and views. But I'm fresher than poetic. I may be pleasant, but I liked it. A beautiful story well put together - by the Canadians, quelle surprise. It only reaches the line of "The film of the week", missing it without being drawn, highly appreciated. And she was pretty smart portrayed.
