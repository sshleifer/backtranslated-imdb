The film takes place in a small Swedish city where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her father for her father's birthday, which sometimes always has a kind of tragedy, the question is exactly what will be this year and you will be surprised ... It's a very well-composed film with a story has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You are happy, hurt and practically everything between them. Finally, you can not fall in love with Mia (if you are a guy I guess (the main actress)) She is an extremely well-chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
