A woman left alone after her husband's death is attracted to his son's boyfriend and the man at hand. In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins to sleep with the man at hand in an effort to revive herself. The twisted side? The man at hand is also her daughter on and off love interest. As if this is not quite strange, my mother manages to fall for this man, and when her daughter finds her she blames not only her dysfunctional, but her tangled life on her poor mother. Although you might think bad about this woman, the truth is that the film manages to portray it in a positive light. Nicely played by Anne Reid, this character has size and great emotion. A really brilliant performance and a nice movie.
