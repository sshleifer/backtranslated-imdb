A solid movie B. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its undervalued delivery is refreshing in a time over top performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked family dynamics. Wendigo looks foolish, but it's a representation of the child's toy and the dead deer. It's an amalgamation, is not it? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy slash of their instant grace. Watch her and reflect on your inner child and the movie that could tell you and you'll be fine. Good job.
