I saw the movie the day she went out last year. I loved it. Well, now it's on the video and I saw it again. I love this movie! Things I do are sometimes bad, but that makes the third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are good, but witty dialogue will make you move. I'm the kind of person who says I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other things, avoid it. But for all the others, enjoy! The actor is superb. Hank Azaria is the best (no comedian or fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (uh, does not correct me, ill) and then William H. Macy, who gives his best performance, praised everyone at macy at garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was good enough as the Invisible Boy. Two Problems: The most boring part of the film is the sub-plot of romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and Casanova's paranormal hearing. Some scenes really progress the story in no way, but it's an explosion. Kink and especially writers have the tendency to shoot on a stage until all that is hilarious has disappeared, but bam they are switching and you're ready for more. I swear that after seeing this, you will be tired of the climax of the explosion (which I think was quite cool). The room is quite cold and is moving at a furious pace with the actors. Also, Tom Waits offers remarkable performance (he has a heinous evil of his hero) and, as someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show a certain humanity for them. Captain Amazing is quite funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I'm ashamed) and the rush is quite cool as Casanova. Beef: The most fun comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So, overall, a great movie. I give it twenty stars and I hope someday everyone will see the brilliance in the best parody of the film, the six million dollars. Laughing right now when I think about it. 20/10
