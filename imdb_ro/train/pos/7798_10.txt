I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice it to say, whenever I'm depressed about how unjustified or unnecessary things occur, this is the movie I rent to put in the right mind plan. Background music makes you aware of the ease of existence and how simplicity ensures the greatest happiness. The Indian singing girl is just an example of a character in this movie that does not try hard and is happy as a result. Ruby (Ashley Judd), Ruby's colleague, is different = the eyes and the smile could make the hardest day. I'm watching this movie and I dream of better days or a good conversation with my friends and I realize that alone - Ruby is alone quite often - is not the same as being alone. Recommended for anyone enjoying a pleasant voice of a movie.
