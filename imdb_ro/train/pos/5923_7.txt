A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town and have to deal with a high-ranking professor (Glenn Shadix), an incestuous relationship, a wonderful girl MÃ¤dchen Amick) a great secret. Okay, so technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving corn) are happening, people are scared about cats cats, they are bad by a line, there is too much cheese to handle! So, yes. You will enjoy this. A lot. It will not move, touch you, scare you, or make you nervous in any way, but it will make you have fun and laugh!
