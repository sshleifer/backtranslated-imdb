An oath to claim is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was as good, although different from the film. You really did think about how you would answer if you were in character shoes. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ALL! Although production is not good at Hollywood - no great special effects - values ​​and ideals are portrayed more than compensating for it. And the cast has done a wonderful job of capturing the emotional bonds between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill. You do not want to miss this!
