This is a delightful movie that is so much over the top that my wife, my daughter, and I found irresistible. Plot is just crazy, but "real rings" in the world of soaps in all its scandalous impossibilities and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performance of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. There is no one better than Kline in playing THICKheaded. She was really desperate for the attention and affirmation of the Field character - and almost bipolar swings - played nicely on Field's famous, "You love me!". The exclamation of the Oscar. People who can take so much salt are, however, too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only film I have not found impatient with Whoopi Goldberg; I thought it was "spot" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first class. Just a great movie, if you are going to go for a trip and to rush!
