While I was an impressive young man when I first met the Gundam Wing series, I reaffirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, gundam design, character design, and depth of character are harmoniously executed. While appearing at first as a bunch of boys, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can be partly created only by great arts, with individual personalities creating clear and agreeable distinctions among the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to get attracted to a certain character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I can be biased to the sentimental attachment of this childhood spectacle, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deep problems of war and life in general (how can we achieve peace) while we offer action battles in costumes big robot, which at least is excellent.
