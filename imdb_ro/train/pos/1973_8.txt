I never trust anybody's views on a movie. This is also true for criticism. Sure, if it gets positive reviews that is OK and a plus, but most of the movies that become critically rave hate. I liked this movie for what it was, a fun movie. It takes you to life for a few hours and a fictional character ... this is Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is great in this role, as in the first. Anyone who says it horrible in this movie must have felt the same thing in the first movie that it returns the same as in the Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays it to perfection. One of them is great, just like in the first. Who can forget the first film when telling the police: "If you're going to arrest me to do it ... otherwise, get out of here!" The great scene, and believe me, it does it again. I was captivated by it. Her costumes, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, deserve the price just to see Stone's performance. I can not wait for this movie to be unreleased on DVD, because I can imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are plenty of twists, like the first, including the end!
