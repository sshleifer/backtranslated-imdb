In The Aunt and The Moon (The Moon and the Moon) he describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete, who is obsessed with growing breasts in Catalonia. I like this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's films (also Jamon's director, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and interesting life can be at that age. Also, being in Catalonia (northeast of Spain), it has brought me a lot of memories. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, cute people, a beautiful life and, in particular, a lot of people who do not.
