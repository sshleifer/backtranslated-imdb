I do not like to write reviews, so I will impose my opinions ... I liked this series at first. Adventure, Action, Comedy, Drama ... I thought everything was brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved everyone. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth most important person in the distribution. It's not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from field to office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I do not know if it is because Hammond was more important than I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned into ****. The first seven seasons, however, were wonderful. The Stargate movie seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, even if it was not the original intention, a brilliant configuration for the series. I recommend you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you will have a total appreciation of it the second time, believe me) and then watch the rest of the TV series. The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. That's just a jump if you spoiled yourself in the first seven seasons. After you finish this series, make sure you look at the spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
