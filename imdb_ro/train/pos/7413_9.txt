The shower keeps itself in many ways. Almost all the film takes place in an old bath, and the inhabitants provide humor, pathos and emotions. The love and friendship between the owner and his retarded son are deep and moving. The way the older brother is attracted to this tiny world seems to be forced and convincing. The story is meandering, full of surprises and ironies, and generally touched by a sense of what should call neighborhood in interpreter's relationships and conflicts. This is a movie I shoot when I want to believe again in the world.
