A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be granted for the effort. "Holes" does not make the same mistakes that one might expect from a Disney movie about troubled teens set in a camp. For the first time, the events are not explained in detail. Flashback scenes really serve a purpose and show some mature subjects that could surprise the spectator. I have to admit that, at first, I was a little off of the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Aside from the story, this film also does a good job of questioning certain methods that are used in correctional facilities. (An example in which Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because he needs to drill holes to build his character, such as learning to read, will not contribute to this.) "Holes" is a smart and beautiful film. I have to watch it!
