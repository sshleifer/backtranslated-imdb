Twelve Monkeys is a crazy movie that travels over time, filmed by action, which plays Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, a man who is sent back in time to gather information about the devastating plague that followed in November 1996. Unfortunately, far from 1990, when everyone thinks he is crazy. This movie is thrilling and has great action performance from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys is one of the biggest traveling movies that I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece 10/10
