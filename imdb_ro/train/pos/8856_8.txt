BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOW THAT IS DEBI, start with promising, setting up a simple heist who goes in order from different perspectives (in the RASHOMON style). Around hour, Sidney Lumet turns this movie into something that is far more than the sum of its parts; Finally, it turns into a family drama with many facets, exploring the whole field of emotions / human relationships as the story reaches the climax of temperament. As in Lumet's case, he succeeds in convincing exceptional performances from his star-cast cast with no notion of over-action or hyperbolic. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarf Ethan Hawke, who interprets his brother, Hank. That does not mean that Hawke is not bad; in fact, he is quite upscale enough, in a troubled role that fits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for its relatively short appearance (the fact that she does not add the meat). The character of Albert Finney (Andy and Hank's father) is the most exciting and, in my opinion, worth a little more time. Amy Ryan also performs his job properly. BEFORE DEVIL KNOWN IS DEBIU is not an exceptional movie, but proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of its features and trademarks appear here, not least involving the use of its characters. Infused with a killer script (it's not a word game), smart dialogue and rhythm, and a decent score, BEFORE THE KNIGHTS DEVICE ARE DEAD is a must-see. A really understated jewel. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Just enter the Top 250 to 248. Highly recommended.
