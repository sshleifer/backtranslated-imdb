As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit this. Crying is not really that bad, but there are a few situations where you really have to ask yourself "what the hell is going on here?" There are many things that make this more funny bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore became so fat and slow when the film was filmed that the special effects consist in accelerating battle scenes to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is an instantaneous slow-moving resumption, jumping on a ten-foot high wall (by falling back), naked men walking in huge letters and sex that literally bring down the cable rope that supports the roof caught in the fire). Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore's film would have been completed without a completely free and random comedy club scene, where Rudy is having fun with all his clients, interfering with people doing strange dances. There are so many bad things about this movie, but I'm stupid in a fun way and if you take your eyes off the movie, you can lose another mistake. Rating: 1/10 for real value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for raising mistakes and geese, averages up to 7/10.
