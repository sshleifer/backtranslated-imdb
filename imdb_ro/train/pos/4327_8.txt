I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they made a very good show with Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even with the arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Mrs. Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have done a better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long books by Dickens - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long time and if you do not care about all the legal situations can be disturbing or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough not to be boring. I loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There's always a kid - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have a chance to judge for ourselves ... I have to say I loved the show. Perhaps if I read the book again, as usual, after seeing the movie, maybe it may be more critical. Meanwhile - I think it's a good presentation.
