I was a fan of the book since the third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequence and then watched the television show. It was a good show in itself, and now, as an adult, I still enjoy the show. My only real problem with this was that he did not follow the book. The first time I saw her, I was so disappointed we stopped her. But that comes from a girl who has a first addition to the book. But after time I decided to try it again and ignored the book (like what you have to do with Harry Potter movies). I found the wonderful series! It was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy for everyone to go. It's really nice! Clean and wonderful!
