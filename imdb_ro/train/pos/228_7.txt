"Convicts" is very much a kind of third act movie. All the dialogue and interaction with the characters that appear in it come from the long wind of a southern late day. And, by extension, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, he worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems to be almost wrapped up in comparison with it. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is only this appropriate part. The slow rhythm leaves much room for Toyomichi Kurita cinema, which infuses the movie with the right sense of light and fragile heat. Because it is essentially a filmed game, little in the way of editing or directing, it all comes to acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are entirely real, uninteresting in terms of life. Lukas Haas, a young actor I've known from the "testament" and "witness," plays a character very similar to his other roles. He is quiet, retired, slightly scared and sad, in a way. These are qualities that seem natural to him. Perhaps a title like "Convinced" is a serving of this film. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to create a picture with a much higher, Western image. If slow-stage scenic productions do not interest you greatly, you'll want to get through this too. Otherwise, it could be exactly the movie you want to do more often. Enjoy.
