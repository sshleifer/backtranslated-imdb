This movie has scenes that come back to me in strange times - that intense scene in which Mr. Muckerji told Mrs. Melandez that someone spoke with the witnesses of the girl who was pushed by the window by a woman who fits with her description is one that is rolling - the way she continues to refer to him by name - in a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and when Boyer discovers that he has just taken poison and gives her a last smack on the side of her head she dies - - It's a delight! "Fools - Fools - all my life" ... etc etc - you will get the point .. I have to buy this. I love Dan Seymour - he usually plays a brilliant foreign sultan or chief of police and appeared in Casablanca and many great pictures.
