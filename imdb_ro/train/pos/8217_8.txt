With this movie being the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only sees but produces and drives, too, you know it must be fine. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best in the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy to be in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action sequences, it does not have the dirty and stony impact of the other three movies. This movie captures all the enthusiasm that makes a good Clint Eastwood movie and has quotes that make a good Dirty Harry movie. In Diry Harry is "Well, I put you, punk?"; in the Magnum Force "Man must Know His Limits"; and in this sense it is "Continue, Make Me Your Day." Also, in this movie, it's nice to see a landscape change because you're a little tired of seeing the same old streets in San Fransisco in the other films of the series. With great action by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good director of Clint, this is, in my opinion, the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.
