Dan Katzir produced a wonderful movie that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a true love affair that is in trouble around modern Israel. For someone who has ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, insecurity and heart that make love so sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time only serves to intensify sentiment. Instantly, you're attracted to Dan's situation, and you can not be deeply moved. You can not write drama and passion like that - the contrast between his desperate realities, Dan's relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in a state of turbulence make it so eminently pursued. If you have an ounce of passion and you have ever been in love, you see this movie.
