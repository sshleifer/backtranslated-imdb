One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and I'll probably watch it at least 100 times. My friends and family are reading so often on this DVD, you think we have done nothing but pursue it. The beginning of Alcatraz is a little slow, but either wakes through it or stretches on the side where Eddie is on the stage. Watch the "Cake or Death" part of the "Hitler / Pol Pot" side (Hard to explain, just watch it). The best part of the show could be Eddie's facial expressions. He can say very much with his eyes. (Mascara, eye and eye, perhaps help, right?) Correct warning: Eddie tends to throw a lot of four-letter words.
