Funny movie. I have seen this movie at the Mardi Gras Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in Sydney since 2002, and laughed from start to finish. The act was subtle but very funny. I'm not absolutely sure about the influence of the "Real World," we do not understand this here, but the movie is without the understanding of the event. Heather B steals any scene in which it appears, especially when acting with her red co-star, a rare speaker. Highly recommended. I would love to see this released on Video / DVD some time in the future.
