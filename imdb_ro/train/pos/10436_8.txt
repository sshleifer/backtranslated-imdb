We managed to capture last night's doubles in "Before Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004) and I saw both films in a row without having the chance to twist or think of the meaning of each movie separately. After I've slept, I have to say I prefer the second one, and I'll explain why. Prior to Sunrise, he introduced us with the young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 when the film was released; and Julie Delpy (Three Colors Trilogy), then 26 (although they look much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer who travels to Europe after he broke up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student on her way home to Paris. They meet the Budapest-Vienna train and decide to spontaneously disconnect the train together. The two spiritually intellectuals and intellectuals spend together a whole night walking on the beautiful streets of Vienna, changing ideas and thoughts and gradually falling on love. The film was written everywhere in 1990: the technology quickly jumped, the new millennium, with all the hopes and dreams, just waiting around the corner, and the young adults as described in the film were full of love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's emphasis, if mistaken or purposeful, was half the American and half French, and changed from one spectrum to another , credibility) were a mirror of time. Watching the naive couple swallow up life with such meaning and enthusiasm, acting clich√©d and romantic, but still managing to get their audience for them, is what made this film work for me. The fact that the director does not let you know if their relationship continues after the movie or does not make everything more valuable while everything. Sunrise is a walk through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a romantic classic encounter and a film I will definitely return to for a deeper understanding in the future.
