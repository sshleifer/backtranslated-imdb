The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," located in the small Äänekoski rural town. Episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deceit and disillusion, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of a young waitress who tries to make a love affair for his colleagues: she emits an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode also shows the old man who dies in a hospital and his wife tries to help him die dignified. Particularly striking is how the old couple has to fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital, and their loneliness contrasts with hospital crew's "routines" (despite signs of occasional empathy). Compared with Altman's classic, this film is maybe less professional, but it's certainly a great piece of art.
