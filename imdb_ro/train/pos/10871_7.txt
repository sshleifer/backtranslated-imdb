Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's choices sometimes feel like a longer image, with many characters and abandoned or eventually unsolved plots. Some of them are treated with really great and far superior success, Elections 2: Harmony is a virtue, but it is still a fascinating thriller of excitement about a contested triad election that avoids ordinary gunfire and explosions (though not violence) changing alliances that can return over the time required to make a phone call. It is also a film where the most ruthless character is not always the most threatening, because the end of the cooling is just too clear: one can imagine a life of psychological counseling that is necessary for all the trauma someone is causing to an unhappy spectator. Simon Yam, too often a variable actor, but always in the best way, under the direction of To, has never been better in leadership, not least because Tony Leung's much more extrovert performance makes his peace stronger.
