I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count how many times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but for the first time when the camera cut her body after being clean-shaven for her first trip to Gilley's, I was in danger. Debra Winger, as always, offers perfect performance as Bud's young, naive wife, but with the attitude needed to be married to a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a country music person, what we were not, this is a soundtrack that will make you sing even with each word. If you have a chance, please see this movie - you will not disappoint.
