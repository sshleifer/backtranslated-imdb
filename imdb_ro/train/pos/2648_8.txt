Indeed, the story of two cute brothers and their fall from grace (through drug addiction) and subsequent redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is your typical, but sensitive, but intelligent child. The other brother is a future physician who works hard and becomes less judge because he himself falls prey to addiction while facing the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. It is not about too many hardships, such as drug fables, and, in general, a pretty realistic outline of family dynamics that drug problems pose. I would recommend anyone interested in such character studies and congratulate James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a love work.
