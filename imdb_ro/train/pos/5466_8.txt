Excellent, pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as a new inspired (through Nietzsche's writings!), To avoid her sensibilities and exploit, she uses people to her advantage. Not too fair to the German philosopher, but interestingly this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much for me, but she definitely does well here, always leading herself and the movie before. There is not so much meat displayed here, as one might have expected, but a lot of risk situations and some amazing and inconvenient shocks. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive show for men, and I suppose with all sincerity that it's not a very attractive view of the golden female. Still, that's life!
