ANCORE Aweigh is a musical entertainment MGM that genre fans will enjoy, but I would not rate up there with classics such as Singing in the Rain or VAGON band. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra starred Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two Hollywood holiday sailors who are friends of a boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces his young auntie actor (Kathryn Grayson) a battle actress who works as a plus to MGM . Although both boys are originally attracted to Grayson, she finally voices a preference for Joe, but Clarence later hooks with a waitress (Pamela Britton), who he learns is from his hometown in Brooklyn. The thin film of paper leaves room for numerous musical numbers, including "We Like to Leave," the lamentation of Joe and Clarence for their sailors when they leave the ship; Gratison of torrid teaching of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's "I Love Fall in Love" (a number that is unfortunately removed from some of the footprints of this film), and "The Song Concern", a fancy dance that Kelly does with Jerry animated mouse Tom and Jerry's fame. Kelly also has a kind of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet, rivaling with his Pirates Ballet in the latest PIRATE play. Kelly is top-of-the-line here in a robust and energetic performance that brought him the only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and endearingly shy character Sinatra here is undoubtedly sexy. A fun diversion for fans of the MGM music factory.
