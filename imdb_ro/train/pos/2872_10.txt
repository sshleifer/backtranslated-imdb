In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic masterpiece of Disney. If you ask me, the stepmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really diabolical. You will have to watch the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite having made a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the table was well-chosen, and the writing was strong. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this disney-romantic masterpiece to all of you who have not seen it. You are in good time, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, do it with a friend and watch it.
