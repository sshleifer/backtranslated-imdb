This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see a great action. Mister. Torn and Mrs. Farrel do a great job. I think she should have her on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it. Great performances. It gives you a real sense of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally. Very unheard of the movie. It was when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I've always thought of her as a comic, but it's certainly not a comedy, and she's great. There are very few dialogues, but this seems more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence, and only his breath has a wonderful feeling. I have to see the movie.
