It seems so amazing that, even after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! Obviously, this movie was not that bad or otherwise people would not be able to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this huge movie, and I still do! I think this movie is not for everyone, but certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "over-hyped" or "over-hyped" ... well, we have just the movie audience to thank for it! lol * See, it's not CRITICS / writers of articles that make a movie "HUGE" or a "HIT" with the general cinema audience. PEOPLE make this movie a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in danger. Let's face it, a movie like this has never been done before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the sinking ship. This film is so precise that even James Cameron has timed the actual sinking of the ship into the REAL movie sinking that day full of facts in April 1912. Even the silver for the right good! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a boys break! Critics have thought that this movie will overwhelm your time! When this movie actually came out and people started to hear with WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising you remember) that it was a good / decent movie that's worth seeing, then everyone started to throwing in theaters in the fullness to see this movie ... not once, not twice but maybe 3 times and more! So I really would not say that this movie was "overloaded" ... at least not like the accumulation of the reloaded MATRIX or the HULK is "overhyped". Ha! Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover the giant film budget of Cameron, which made him make this mammoth of a movie. However, the money in the movies took care of that budget of 200 million and much more! <br /> <br /> Personal, I LOVE this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say that this movie is a shit just because of romance though! This is the sexiest thing I've ever heard! Do not like a movie just because it has a love in it! The story was sweet. Dialogue could have been better, but let's face this ... the real star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... it was GIGANTIC Ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, have done a good job. It's not the best work (I've seen a lot better from both of us) but it was not the biggest I saw on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
