One of the many musicals about sailors on vacation, is the usual meeting of the sailor, complications, solved in a kind of happy plot. It continues along pretty quiet, but it also draws in places. Dialogue is not as strange as "Top Hat," for example, and Randolph Scott seems to be no longer the place. They are compensation. He has some of Irving Berlin's most favorite songs, including "Let Yourself Go", "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket" and "Let's Face Music and Dance." Does Fred and Ginger, who, when dancing, take any film in heavenly heights and do not disappoint here. They make a nice dance, a comedy dance and a graceful dance all in the same movie! Great versatility and art. She also has Harriet Hilliard, who is pretty good at her role. She had a varied career, becoming the famous Harriet Nelson and Ozzie. Here she touches without being sentimental. Two songs are simply delivered. It makes a good contrast to Ginger, but you can think that they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More tightening made the movie even better. Pretty good, though.
