This is the best of Shelley Duvall's "Faerie Tale Theater" series. Ugly slaves are a relief for high quality comedies, and Eva Arden is the personification of the stepmother of sin. Jennifer Beals does a great job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with the charming Prince of Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays beautifully, although I'm not sure I liked the characterization of the "South lady" with some of the lines. Steve Martin is a comedian as the conductor of the royal orchestra, but Martin is a quintessential, but a little lost in the flow of the show. As is common with the series, there are some terrible comments for older children (aged 15 and over). With a few small blows, the show runs well and I live happily afterwards. Children up to the age of eight will continue to look after parents finally get bored of it - I discovered three times in a single day that I'm too much.
