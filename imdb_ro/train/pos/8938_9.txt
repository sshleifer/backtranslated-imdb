A great version of the best-selling film and Broadway game play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who have lived for over 100 years and told their story of attending a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll offer very good performances like Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, White New York Times reporter whose article about sisters has released the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the current ones are very powerful, if not as inspirational as the book. This is the only real disadvantage, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as the inter-racial background of the mother's sisters and why their father was so harsh. But something other than that, a very well done film, made excellent, strong.
