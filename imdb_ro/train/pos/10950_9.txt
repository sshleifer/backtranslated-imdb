When I saw this show for the first time, I thought it looked interesting. I watched her, I saw her spin around Sarah, as if the character saw the world ... around her. I took it but did not laugh a lot. On stage and in her show, she is racist, brutal, insensitive, and extremely selfish. We did not get it at first, and we took them to face value. Then I came to see his movie, Jesus is Magic. I think he served Sarah Silverman for me, explaining what language I'm talking about. It's like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to give us an idea and horrible images, but in the end you realize it's not an assault, it's a statement. And once you understand that, you will find that you are glad that someone was finally giving you. I do not mean to suggest that only intelligent people will understand or hate this show is to prove your idiots. While I enjoy a lot of "smart" shows, I still do not see the humor of your curve of enthusiasm until today. I think it's good, but I do not understand. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came. The creators of this show work hard, each episode is loaded not only with dialogue and plot, but with tunes or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not put together something to fill a slot of time and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to do the best show they can put together. If I wanted to predict the future of this show, I would say that it will go on the road of arrest development and sneaks and geeks. It will be canceled before the hour and will live in the hearts of the fans and on the DVD. But take heart, the creators of the SSP, your audience is there and we will watch as long as they let you make the show.
