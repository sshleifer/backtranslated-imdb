Shoot in an impossible program with no budget to say, the movie turned out to be much better than you would have expected, certainly more true to Peter O'Donnell's books and comic books than the two previous films. You can read the current tape in the Titan books or in the monthly Comics Revue magazine. It is one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low budget movies, it takes full advantage of what it has and has an interest in. On the DVD, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is obviously killed with stones, is a gas. Some people accused Tarentino of assuming his name with the film, but without him it would never have been done. He is a fan of Modest Blaise and chose a good director and writer. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
