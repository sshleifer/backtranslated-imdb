I first read the book when I was a young teenager, then I saw the movie one late night. One year ago I checked IMDb and found no copies available. Then I hit the web and found a site that offers War Films, so glad that I did, ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again. In my opinion, to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I watched a copy down through E-bay, author Alan White was a commander / paratrooper during the Second World War that took part in clandestine disarray operations and this was his first book. It's written by someone who knows this, and I think he's giving the book and the authenticity of the movie. I did not give a ten movie only because of the nature of the film finalization, not as well as the book. There are a few lines of plot that differ from the book, too, which is odd because the book does not refer to the wider nature of the war, but to the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally. I have a copy of the book to allow my son to read and then the movie to let him look in that order. If you can watch it down on the book and the movie, then it certainly deserves and I just want to make it much easier to read and see one of my best war movies ever!
