Because I'm so interested in lake monsters, I dug this movie. This movie is worth visiting. If you like so terribly good movies are, check it out. The effects are really good, as well as think of "Land of the Lost." I first watched this movie in the early '90s, perhaps more than 89/90 on a local monster channel show called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared, but I was 8 years old and every B felt more than a year. Later I saw it on DVD at a local Circuit City and I bought it right away, so I'll give it a 9 because it has a personal place in my heart with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good fun movie B for all ages.
