If you enjoy Cleese and the British "Pythonesque" noise of the time, then this little jewel is absolutely hilarious. Arthur Lowe is a true traitor! I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out, and its classic quotations have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do it forever! I have it on tape and is appreciated continuously. Maybe some commentators take it too seriously. I can not believe that it is now only available in the United States (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of British humor history!
