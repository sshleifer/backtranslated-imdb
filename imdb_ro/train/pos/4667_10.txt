I recently found this movie on VHS after I searched for several years, I was not disappointed. It improves every time I see it. Peter Ustinov sang and co-wrote the original screenplay (Oscar nomination). The other stars you've heard are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant, he was just released from the wretched prison of England of a worm ashtray (he hijacked it from the Conservative Party headquarters, elected for being a liberal). He immediately starts searching for a new employer from which he can kill him and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. Social engineers head for a men's club in London and learn the identity of the best city computer experts, he steals the identity of a Caesar Smith who has just left the city for South America to continue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. Speaks in Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially with regard to his security character, made up of an intermittent blue light. Ustinov asks the computer to defeat its security, and the computer tells him, "Disconnect the blue light." Using hacking techniques from the next 30 years, Ustinov enters the system and schedules his computer to generate written checks at various fictitious companies. The scheme begins to reveal when Klemper's assistant Willmar G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notices the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co seems to carry out with Ustinov's misleading companies. With the help of his secretary, Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily afterwards. Let me tell you how it would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent and before-to-time.
