This is the best series I've seen throughout the year. I can not believe it's just my luck - a series I love is six episodes (and more next year), and the constant flow of cookie-cutter cops never ends with episodes. The reasons for the success of the new tricks are many. Scenarios are good, and the mix of superb characters, the Actor is a top flight, and the combination of comedy and drama works as a living. Stories are not so memorable, but that's not why I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> Thematic song is a favorite and I was disappointed that it is not available in any published edition. A great thing, the BBC - a triumph of meaning to sexual intercourse (besides the young master who nobody finds in his eyes, and even though he is, he can still act!).
