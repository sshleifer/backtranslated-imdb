I watched this movie with his brother and girlfriend. The place was packed enough and I laughed so hard it was easy to lose lines. I knew it would look good, but it was much fun than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed very weird, just like ordinary people, if that makes sense. I'm tired of movies showing that adolescents are like cut people, such as "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to tie them. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and I look forward to seeing it on DVD, Go and see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I'm going to see her again in the theater and I'm not going to see things many times very often.
