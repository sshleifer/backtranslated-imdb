<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mixture of sensuality and maturity. The movie runs slow, very slow, but takes a rhythm to tell a story about crime and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives real performance), and Rachel Ward is just sexy. Sexual tension, psychological heat, the steps of the past ... the retro scene, the strangeness of Patric's character, all become a sexy mystery. I recommend this cause is the sexy movie I've ever seen. Check out the scene of love, it is especially sexy.
