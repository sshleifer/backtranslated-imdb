It's hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story and how Christy managed to accomplish this miracle is so intimate. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, very hard to imagine how much he has done to create this handicapped character. Watching it on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is pretty brilliant and interesting. Christy is not despised by the normal, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of loneliness and the pain in his eyes. An important factor in Christy's success is his mother's support, which seems to be more moving, and the unknown actress, Brenda Fricker, also deserves the Oscar for this role, this middle-aged, fat woman uses it all for to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also great as young Christy, what a show for a child! Christy's love story is very well done, confident. Christy wants love and nothing can deduce him from the love to love, his passion for beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, Aunt Petunia, in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are right next to each other. <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are good (in America, The Boxer, etc.), except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, the god knows why he chose to shave his shit! Really a career burden for him, what a pity!
