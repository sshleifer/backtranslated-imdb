Notice that everyone who did not like and did not like this movie commented that it is not as good as the book or that it is different from the book. I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different environments. While the books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, the movies are about 120 minutes long. However, the movie has the advantage of stimulating some senses: visual, audio, and imagination. I do not care if a movie is as good or actually has a resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it is. This TV movie was charming. An old and often-encountered, prone to encirclement story could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves pull it. A commentator found Riffen much older. I would not have guessed he was 40 years old when he made this film. It is her duty as an actress that she played an amazing 23-24 years of age. I also think it's about the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the game on the screen could have used "tightening". However, it is worth forgetting; It is clearly not a story of strong love, but rather a charming story that will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and that good goes beyond evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory word of f # $%, naked buttocks or kissing kisses. Finally, the musical score is excellent.
