The sopranos were probably the last best show in the 1990s. it's sad that, over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, not everything was written for you in everything you had to think, it was brilliant. the distribution was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his excellent character as well as others. Each character had deficiencies, which made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them and that is why it lasted so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to get it, many different things can be interpreted by the final id, like I think Tony did not die, but the meadow came in and sat down with them and the darkness it was just for suspense. Tony will have to go to court and handle that we hope is not dead like that I feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
