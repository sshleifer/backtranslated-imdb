well, but simply stupid. It's not bad for a horror movie / comedy. I read how people passed with the Michael version and that's a good trick in my opinion, because some adults hate horrors and when they see it, they'll make them interested in horror movies like this or maybe (they did not have it never seen) horror (probably comedy) uncle Sam, I'll have to see about renting or buying that movie, but the second one is a lot better than that, but I bought this on the Amazon VHS and I took it 21 November, the day before thanks. worth the four dollars, l.o.l. to this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
