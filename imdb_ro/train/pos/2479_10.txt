(Sorry for my faulty tongue, I'm not a native speaker ...) Yes, this is a movie that almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally I agree with all the superlatives around. But I will not use this semantic mode to describe the movie here. Because the "perfect one and only the best !!!" Comments make some people turn away (including myself) <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another "Hamlet" that has the potential to rival with many theater and all the cinematics - Then do not this rate, if you happen to find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, not many people will have any chance to see it. There seems to be no DVD there, and the German version - which is pretty good done - is not available in any format) <br /> <br /> Only if you decide to get a copy: Release it has cut a two-hour (or so) version of this movie. It is not useful and fun and it gives the wrong impression of a movie that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture. And he also hurt in a proportion of 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
