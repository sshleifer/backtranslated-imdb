While Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen transforms an extraordinary disturbing performance into "The Dentist". With his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in the upper step, the IRS finds him and a suspect wife of action; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing health more and more every day. When Doc truly realizes that his wife has an affair with the boy at the local pool, there is a series of events that lead to torture, killing, chaos of the total mite! "Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes Dr. Feinstone's character be relatable and ugly at the same time. Even if he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy for him. That my friends ... are good actors. A beautiful, solid dance of actors supporting this gem of a movie. Excellent direction, good kills and gore, and effective stimulation will keep you entertained during filming. <br /> <br /> RECOMANDAT IN VEDERE!
