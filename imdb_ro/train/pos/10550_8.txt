I have seen this as part of my Aberystwyth University course and I get tired of having no distributor in the UK. Well, no, because this movie is all Hollywood movie - original, creative, weird and humorous. It seems that today no one wants to see this type of film because, in simple terms, it is not in line with the generic conventions that most young people are looking for in a movie. has not written a review for IMDb over the years, but has felt the inclination to give this film a special mention, even if it's during the 30-minute break between classes! Essentially, this is nothing, because the two main characters are put into their own world of nothingness through a hatred of the world. The brilliance here is how the director has shown his interest in most of the time, with only two characters, and when the only mission-scene consists of a half-house and a vast white space. This is largely due to the stellar performances of the actors, both of which offer great laughter, while being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles. I'd love to write a little more, but I'm pretty limited. However, I encourage everyone and everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed manner, with a combination of good performances, a powerful scenario, beautiful sound design, and impressive (pretty) visions that create a very fun movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame so few people know about nothing ...
