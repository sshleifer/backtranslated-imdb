I never heard of this movie before I saw it, I wondered if it was an independent film and I was right, but with a good cast I decided to chase it. Practically, drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and owner Wayne Brown (JT Walsh of Pleasantville) receives a large amount of money wrong for a man who hit her hired to kill his unbelieving wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct it, take the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after making him a counter-terrorist, he decides he has to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he is following Michael to shoot a big gun until he gets into a car with Dallas Lyle (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the man-shot he has confused and makes a quick retreat. He returns to Suzanne and, knowing they are in danger, plans to leave the city together and add another complication, subtracting each other. But before leaving, Suzanne insists on going and stealing a large amount of money safely. Of course, things will not work well, and Wayne and Lyle will catch them, and Lyle forces them and now makes Wayne go and get his money buried. Eventually, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne wake up together in a moving train, but obviously he cares more money and gets what he deserves. He also starred with Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, besides maybe a Boyle blades, are all well and dandy, and he has a pretty good movie feel noir for a black comedy thriller. Very good!
