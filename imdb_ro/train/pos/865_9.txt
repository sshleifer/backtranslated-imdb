Vincent Cassel plays that part of Paul, an ex-cone, in an office job where he meets Carla, a secretary who is "pretty deaf," when his hearing aids are "very deaf"? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other to develop as people. What was particularly interesting about this movie was the complexity of the characters? do not fall into obvious stereotypes. Paul seems anxious in the office environment, is that he is not just cut for work? This conviction is scattered when it becomes a job in a bar and shines. The film has a certain amorality that I find refreshing and I have shown how easy it is to act in a criminal way, even if we believe it is harmless or justified. Finally, it's a movie full of wonderful moments, both exciting and humorous. One is when Carla makes babysitting and tries to comfort her screaming child. Does she still cuddle him? but he's hearing for his own comfort.
