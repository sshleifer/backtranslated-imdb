After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons noted 1979 "The House Next Door" was filmed in the end. The result draws a bit closer to the novel, which, especially in the first story of the trilogy, is understandable if it is not satisfactory, because it is a TV movie, the whole absorbing and actually very good, not as big as the book, one by Stephen King's favorites and one of me, too. With more time and fewer constraints than the theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original story of three parts of the ultra-modernly threatening house could have been explored and cultivated, especially the climatic revelation near the other end. However, the entire distribution is doing well in this wonderful story of mindless wickedness. There are some unnecessary shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fears is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its amateur-artist neighbor, who seeks to visualize his corruption on the canvas.
