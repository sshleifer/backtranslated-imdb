I personally could not get into "This is not a love song", it's a brilliant movie and there's an extraordinary story about it, I just woke up checking my phone time every two minutes to see how much movie. I like the relationship between Spike and Heaton, there so close that they depend on one another to understand life. At the same time, I want the relationship to be more than what it is. Heaton is in love with the spike, but Spike Ibsen't is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. The acts of betrayal on both sides have a great effect on the two men. Both are devastated by the fact that the other fled and abandoned them at a time when they really needed one for another to survive.
