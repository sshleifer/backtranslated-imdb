Fortunately, as a student, I have been able to watch "Diagnostic Murder" for many years. This is a doctor who solves the crimes with his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM offered 8 exceptional entertainment seasons. What made it different from many other police shows and deserves to be watched was often her expression and writing quality. The main scenario gave good results, and Dick Van Dyke's entertainment roots shone through the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were rapid rhythm, witty scriptures and, of course, the score of the feet. Unfortunately, it was unjust compared to "Crime, she wrote." DM is far superior, offering several mysteries that are hard to solve and varied. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. The days of some police shows that are good, familiar, disappeared. Now I'm just depressing "pebbles."
