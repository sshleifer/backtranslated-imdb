As in most of Eleanor Powell's films, it runs along the thinnest of the plots. For some reason - oh is explained! - chose to carry a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good boys and bad boys compete for the mine and who is confused. But, as always, Powell's dance is superb and worth the admission price. And in this film Lahr plays his lion cowardly, evoking warm memories of that 1939 Technicolor film. An extraordinary benefit is the hearing of a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and weak vulnerability that he later abandoned to his wise man. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful moment that shows his virtuosity. Look especially for his unique duet, Dorsey's trumpet, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique," maybe out of ignorance, but I do not know any other drum / trumpet sequence like this on the movie or recordings. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's poor character is relatively short. Powell shows again that he is the greatest film dancer ever.
