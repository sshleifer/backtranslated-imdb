I think a large number of viewers have totally missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films. This is not a bad movie - it's a clever language in cheeks to get the news. I do not think this movie was taken seriously for a moment. What makes this unique movie is that he is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of whom are black, one Asian and one Mexican / Hispanic character. These are not the usual Western women - they are hard - they can shoot fast and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They're so tough, even the bartender gets shaken when they pour their whiskey. The land that moves this story is typical of Westerners - in blame 'you shot my brother' I'll make you ! "Only in this vest, a woman's sister was shot and she came out of revenge for the band that did it. So she goes and rotates her old chicks in her bank, robbing days. One of them, Mary, is not really interested in revenging Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that there is gold and hidden jewelry in the city where she is headed. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that make no sense, not that they mix so much that they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So the film could use a little bit more tightly but, above all, this is a well-done film that failed to find an audience that recognized what it is. My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - "heroine," one is obviously right, other sexual orientations are never revealed.
