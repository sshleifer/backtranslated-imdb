I liked China's cinematic recreation in the 1930s in this wonderful movie. The story is simple. An older male performer wants to pass on the art of a young man, although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of the children of those who treat them well and their desire to be treated well. The works of the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and more complicated. The story here reminds me of a story by Dickens about the days when the children were almost mobile. The plot is a bit predictable and a little too sentimental to me, but it's worth the time to look for heroism, humanity and portrayal of history.
