This movie is an excellent military film. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing precision for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found that this movie is too slow for their taste, but? like a retired soldier? I appreciate the rhythm that the film crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allocated. The story itself has been told and reproduced several times, but remains for a professional soldier? and an African American to that? to report the story of the film crew and to present the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's job of becoming a Diver of the Navy, and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story he presented. There I have the story about how Mr. Chief Petty Officer defied the illegal order of his commanding officer on Sunday, that second-class Brashear secondary officer did not pass his diving test no matter how well he did and paid the price of a single-band loss, and a change of assignment. He also said the true story of how Brashear found the third lost hydrogen bomb in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the broken track that would have been overturned he in half, if Brashear had not removed him and taken himself. This was a complex story worth mentioning, and I'll admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the story and I can tell from deleted DVD scenarios that the crew tried everything they stood to tell a story as long as possible complete possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a funny story so comprehensively and to see the nautical traditions and honor held in such a natural and complete manner.
