I love this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. Action never stops. The whole movie was done very well. The end is very good. Ontop to be stuffed, they even have a surprised put there for you. When I saw the movie on the Internet, I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie, but I feel like I'm a big fan of Luke Perry, I decided to give her a chance. I'm glad I gave her a chance because it was a great movie. It was very original. Anyone who thought this movie gets a standing ovation from me. The act was great. Luke Perry did a great job once again. I give this movie the highest rating.
