Yes, it's a crazy movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget it ...... but if you like John Candy's Humor, it's a must-see. We've lost John Candy before he's made the big comedy brand, and he's just better in a movie: Aircraft, Trains & Cars (with Steve Martin). Excellent support performance of Eugene Levy, perhaps the best work in Sal DiPasquale's history. It also works well with Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. You have to see this dark and outlandish film if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
