In this documentary, we meet Roger, the wealthy manager of a Chinese factory that sells and sells beads and other small items at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities they offer, but interviews with four of them tell another story. The gloomy life of the girls is presented in contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras. Filming film David Redmon should be praised for having obtained excellent and rare images of everyday life inside a Chinese factory complex and to land a revelatory interview in the room with the head of the American company who imports and sells beads . The film is convincingly said and clearly serves its purpose as a window behind what are ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
