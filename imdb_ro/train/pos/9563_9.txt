First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original movies I have ever seen; shows a Cambodian's poverty environment. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around killing people to survive; has done it throughout his life. Sam Lee's (Wai) duty is to surprise the cambodge forever. There are tons of violent actions, but it has a good story. The film shows the battles between the two characters; they both fought like angry dogs. Go and watch PPL ... STRONG SUGGESSTED! (GO HK FILMS)
