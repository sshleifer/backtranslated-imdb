that's what I call a great movie. lives through the fantastic abilities of the actors and a simple but human story. there are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, just like life. The bus driver and his son collect people through the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the Belgrade capital. the fun and cruel situations that happen on the road connect people and pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> Watch it and you will remember it for life ... humorous and glorious lifestyle. and another reason for his magic: it's hard to get it!
