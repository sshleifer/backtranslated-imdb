... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. Despite all the other comments written here, I even prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more coherent story line. However, Davis Mildred's rough emotions seem to me more appropriate for a girl who seems to be a prostitute easily. are those raw emotions that are part of what falls in love with the poor doctor. It has emotions of despair, failure, "alterity" - strong emotions that repress them. Davis Mildred, on the other hand, displays his emotions immediately and without censorship. No feelings of despair, of failure or of "alterity"; Rather, she just survives as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrait was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis's, almost in the film. Davis Mildred was never vulnerable until he had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when it comes back - for her method of keeping the body and soul together and always taking advantage of love for her - it certainly unleashes the most passionate repudiation of the holy snobber than the attitude ever seen on the screen: "I am wiped his mouth! I wiped his mouth! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb voted concur!
