Revival jewel "lost"! Featuring an effective dialogue combined with excellent action to set the characters and get involved enough to care what is happening to them. The Douglas and Widmark characters are real heroes. Palan is the usual presence of his evil. Widmark wins the pistachio battle scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds, a "logical" end, and a long foot walk that shames the Hollywood tracking sequences. You know how it will probably end, but suspense and interest are sustained throughout your life. The end of the pursuit is one of the most realistic you will ever see. The film seems to slow down a bit, but it remains with him for the rewarding conclusion.
