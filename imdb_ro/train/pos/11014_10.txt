I liked to look at Cliffhanger, when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she slipped, I thought it was a terrifying scene, as I think when you see that, your nerves in your body I come to you because it makes you full of fear and your heart beats faster. I liked to watch Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as Rambo and Rocky.
