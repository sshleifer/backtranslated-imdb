I went into this movie thinking that it would be a movie with a buzz. I was surprised and very amused. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an amazing comedy program. The banknotes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny, with one or two flat jokes between them. The pleasure was enough to bind them together, a woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and returns to haunt the woman who comes out with her husband, her sounds to be accompanied, but actually works pretty well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Generally, it's a worthwhile cinematic watch if you do not get it on DVD when it comes out.
