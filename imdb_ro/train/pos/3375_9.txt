In this film, 2022 looks like the seventy. This is funny at first, but soon the viewer perceives how different the fact that the futuristic decadent world is despite appearances, the things we take as such can become unavailable. Characters often interact in a strange way, without tact or manners or respect. I think this is intentional, it's not bad. After all, whoever witnessed the social changes of the 1960s and 1970s can assume that by 2022 the inhabitants of an overcrowded city behave like this. I did not like most scenes of action, except for the priest's death: too cheap even for the seventies. The land is not too polished. But great scenes and ideas - such as Sol's death, the way the rebels and corpses are approached, "furniture" - overcome the shortcomings of this film. 8 out of 10.
