RIGHT TO DANGER can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score. It's creepy and beautiful, but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's, and while listening to the soundtrack that you remember A WOMAN'S SCRIPT, READ JOE BLACK and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you remember other movies that the story is unfolding on screen. As Sullivans leads America for trying to get rid of a psychotic man who has thought you about THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are THE BROWSER CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster episodes. Despite having seen everything before feeling this should not be taken as a heavy critic of Sam Mendes's film that I repeat is haunted and beautiful and the only defects working against her is a very sluggish opening twenty minutes and I was easily confused about the events that prompted Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stop thinking about how much a sentimental miserable Spielberg would have produced with the story of a father and his 12-year-old son going for their lives, not you can think of what a superb Mendes director is <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a film in which the entire distribution delivers perfect performance. I've never been so interested in Tom Hanks, but he's as good here as any major role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no point do I think I'm looking at a legend of the American screen that puts a fake accent - Newman's performance is due to the subtle language of his body, his character is broken by guilt, but Newman never drink or go over the top. While never supporting Newman, which offers the best performances in the film, the two British actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while the law will still have a long career as the main actor as Daniel Craig could have progressed as character character if he had not decided to become James Bond, a role that announces the end of actor's career
