I have to confess that I did not read M R James's original story, although I read many of his other supernatural stories. I've also seen most of the previous BBC stories about Christmas and this, in my opinion, goes beyond most of them, just like The Signalman. I can not really come A View From a Hill - the direction and "mood" are perfect, such as driving, enlightenment and, of course, storytelling and writing. I really enjoyed this and I can only hope for more quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC intends to do something more (not necessarily based on M R James's stories), so it's promising.
