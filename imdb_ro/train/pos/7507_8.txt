Greetings again in the dark. Mary Heron collects quite a lot of movies that give a look at their specific era. Last year, "I filmed Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," they were in the best moments when commenting on the strange society at that time. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is just as much a peak behind the curtain in the world of photography shot in the 1950s. The film is fun to watch both from the narrative perspective and the look technically how it was shot and put together. Blue B & W film and photos capture time and color insertion in Miami Beach through Bunny Yeager's photos are very well done. Supported distribution is strong with David Strathairn (fresh from Edward R's Murrow's role), Chris Bauer (Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the movie is Gretchen Mol wonderfully talented and undervalued. Mrs. Mol always brings a dress and spirit into her roles. She was absolutely fascinating in a little seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the famous Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is perfect. She seems to be enjoying this role and helps us understand how the girl next to Tennessee could become the queen of the underworld. As we would expect, the soundtrack of the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the artists interpreted. Although the film indicates that it has provided history in this industry, the last third collapses, hindering pure cinematic magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this fun movie to watch and one that will offer endless performances on HBO in the near future. Now, someone, please turn Ms. Mol to the star she should do?
