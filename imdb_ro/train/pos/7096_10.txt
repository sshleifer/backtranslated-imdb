I had the privilege of seeing this movie at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was faced with a camera crew from a local TV station looking for movie commentaries. At that moment, the only words that got rid of my mouth were "Wonderful, just wonderful." I like to think I can articulate a bit better than that, but at that time I was somewhat incapable of doing it. The story is intriguing and provocative, and acting is the first rate of all directors. This movie was the first film that Terry Gilliam has advised him that he does not have a hand on the written credit. Back with Universal, after his long and cumbersome struggle with "Brazil," Terry had accomplished what he wanted most; the final cut. "Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been carefully crafted with determination and persuasion, but justice is for such an individual to be free in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, there are limitations in such arrangements The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this movie is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the box, including an audio-director and producer commentary and an informative documentary and extremely exciting 90 minutes about making the film "Hamster Factor and Other Stories from Twelve Monkeys." It's about some of the movie's pitfalls, including a test of appreciation when the preview previews were badly tested, hitting the team with feelings of doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little re film and released him in enormous success. <br /> <br />
