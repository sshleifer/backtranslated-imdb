Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this season in 2003 (end of May) and a good improvement of Carrey's crazy and personal roles in previous comedies. With a slight antique in Carrey's tone, but with the trap and crackle of his old self, Carrey bears this movie at the height of laughter and also some dramatic, painful tearful moments. Jim's real skill elements continue to appear in this film. This pleasant summer fun hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements, along with the blundering moments that fit perfectly with this scenario. While still missing in a superb comedy / drama ensemble, Bruce, Almighty deserves credit because it was a great movie along with a solid message and a spiritual cynic and soft parody that keeps its good taste. Eight of the ten stars.
