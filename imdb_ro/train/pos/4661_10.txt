I can only praise the other reviews here. It is a delightful film with a common sense that it does without crossing the line into sentimental sentiment. Of course, sweet - without the addition of sugar. A small point: it seems to me that the slight objections to Ustinov's character, Pendelton being able to enter and defeat the security of the system, ignores the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / scholar of such things. Yes, the film was quite computerless, but he showed that Pendelton is studying computers at his apartment, and I think the involvement should have been as his gifts would allow him to simply swallow the whole subject, practically overnight. <br /> There were strange moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole is trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we should have believed that Pendelton was cowardly guilty of these situations, or if he was well-informed enough to pass the tests - it was unclear. he needed to know enough to fix the dummy's accounts. Perhaps Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own rather foggy notion of how the computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what is happening, it is necessary to know exactly what concept it had. They knew there was something about "procedures" that were important; they believed that "intelligent light" could actually control security, rather than indicate its state; they thought the user's terminal features would strongly influence what they could do on their own mainframe - although, in addition to things like graphics, they do not actually see it. they tried to avoid the subject of real computer operations as far as they could, and they did that pretty well. By allowing them to hold a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts have had any flaw worth mentioning. <br /> <br />
