Very sorry, many people did not understand this and the next episode. But do not worry! bad explain it and I :) This episode is divided into two parts. The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. <br /> <br /> The second part is what happens in real life. What people have not understood is that Tony's dream is more than a dream. in this episode is about preparing for his death. He loses his own identity and eventually even looks at himself, thus untie all his ties to this world. You will notice what I say at the doctor's stage, where Tony says he has lost his briefcase containing his "life." These decision-makers have really done a great job of interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode a unique thing with great spiritual significance. Like any soprano episode, acting and filming are great. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role of the monks. I'll look at it all the way. anyway this episode really touched me and I do not think anyone else can see what's happening in a near-death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 no doubt.
