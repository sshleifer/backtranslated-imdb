Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect to have fun and have the same fun or just as she did. Fay Grim continues to surprise by offering a solid continuity to a story that does not seem to need it. Once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, he is becoming more aware that this is one of the best successes of the brilliant indie film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. I am a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I am happy to be part of this short term. He is convincing and delightful as Agent Fulbright. Also a delight is Liam Aiken, who portrays pretty well Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry. This movie is a pleasure for so many reasons. I am delighted, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the loser he seems to (until the end of the madman) and to discover further that he is in fact a genius ... well, that really is a wonderful stroke of pen. I hope to make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems missing. He should give Ned Fool Grim and should look for Liam to seek his father, to validate his mother's wonderful change and the sense of genius close to himself to feel good inside him. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to retain many of his most important deeds concerning his father. Looks like it should be done. I would buy it. Even with more actions, this is not yet a movie of action. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery of a kind. I will look many times. It misses a 8.3 / 10 from ... Fiend :.
