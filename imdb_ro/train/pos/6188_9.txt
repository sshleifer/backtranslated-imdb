A murder investigation takes place behind the scenes, while The Vanities on the opening night play in an unknown audience. A strange combination of musical mystery and murder is worth watching for its distribution, production numbers and new film novelty. Gertrude Michael is an actress who plans to end the marriage between the show stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as her role in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" (which was also on Bette Midler's 70s album). So while the choir girls are mixing behind the scene, cunning detective Victor McLaglen mirrors the girls as they try to solve the backstory crime of an unknown woman. We learn quickly that maids (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson outside, that Jessie Ralph is the mother of Brisson and that Jack Oakie's stage manager falls into everything. A lot of plots spin through the musical numbers. The most famous piece of the show is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where do they come from?" And there is a weird rhapsody that erupts in a number of specialty in Harlem, starring Duke Ellington! Pretty cast. Some terrifying things here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good too. Brisson is a total of zero, though. Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
