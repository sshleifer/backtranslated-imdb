The wooden horse was one of the first stories of escaping World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I love this film on VHS by to the Amazon in England and transfer it from PAL format to the US I read the book when I was in high school after seeing a portion of the movie in the early 1960s on the TV Taunt of Peter and John trying to get rid of Germany during the war is more realistic than the whistle of escapades portrayed in the Great Escape. This movie is a lost treasure that should be more accessible to the American public.
