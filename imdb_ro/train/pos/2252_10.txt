Henry Hathaway was bold but also enthusiastic about his love for the people in the early days of US history. However, to criticize the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the people of Mormon are not necessary or useful in commenting on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway made a gorgeous direction that conveys what a Mormon people was in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the period from the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the release of the film. In subtle filming often in dialogue, he covered the philosophies and teachings of Mormon in many segments and scenes. I remember watching this movie on many Saturday morning during my youth in the early 1950s. That was just over 10 years after the film was released, and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I chose to build and instil more curiously who the Mormons are. I recently bought this movie and I enjoy the following messages that Hathaway has performed in his film. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Charity for those who need it or not, 3. Family is of great importance, 4. Listen carefully and carefully, because even the opposite messages have important points to consider and adopted. Work hard, both individually and in the community 6. Prepare and keep for the next days of need 7. Hope is a binding bond with a superior being and for our daily life 8. And there is a unique quality for any group and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.
