There have been many talks about "psychological Westerners," but this is one of the few who really are in this genre. She has great stars who perform very well, but the director is the one who makes this movie good. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of British safari hunting to play a buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays at the beginning of the film (as opposed to the average youngster, Taylor's middle-aged character), who wants to sacrifice buffaloes and admire Granger in business with him. He hires two other big names, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing he might be guilty if they disappeared, knowing if they disappeared, native American life would suffer a lot. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but he is a realist, unlike the unique dimensional sadism of the modern film created by nerds and dorks. She is insecure and needs a human company. Still, he will not stop at the murder. The end penetrates the two against each other with a staggering conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well described.
