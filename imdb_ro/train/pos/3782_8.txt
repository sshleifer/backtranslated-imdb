When I was a kid, I totally loved both Bill & Ted movies. Last night, Bogus Journey was and since it was at least 5 years since I saw her last time, I decided to come in. And I loved it everywhere! This movie is still funny after those years. "Excellent adventure" is better, but this rock is the same. Sure, some of the performances are a bit cheesy, but hey, the whole movie is cool cheese. In addition, he presents the hottest character of death ever in a movie! Conclusion: Totally like a fake movie! Excellent way! STATION!!!
