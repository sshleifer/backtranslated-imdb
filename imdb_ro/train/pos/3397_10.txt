Soylent Green IS ... a very good movie, in fact. I'd never thought of it. I do not really like Heston in his science fiction efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manage to come across all the tricks and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he is crying for much of Soylent Green as well, but as an incredible bully has to be played, I do not mind at all. I can understand why some people will turn their nose to this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visuals (what you know - looks exactly like 1973) and is lacking in action. But I admired the vision of the film about a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so excited to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving and funny role. Wonderful moments of wonderful characters - like when sharing some precious food with Heston - really make the movie. Soylent Green's message is quite relevant nowadays when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny, do not you see Heston in a movie movie Michael Moore ...
