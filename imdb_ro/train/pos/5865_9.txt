He saw this on the cable back in the early 90's and loved him. I have not seen him again until he recently appeared on the cable. You still find a great movie from Vietnam. You're not sure why it's not bigger. I found everything about this convincing film. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can refer to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is more aggressive now with our situation in Iraq. I would like this to be offered on cable more often for people to see. The human charge on our soldiers is not left on the battlefield. He brought home for the rest of it. And this movie is one of many that brings the house very hard. Excellent film.
