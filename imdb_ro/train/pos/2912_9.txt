Nowadays, we throw too much around the term "superstar," but here's a guy really worth it. I was stuck to the set of the whole show. The selection of the song was perfect - it contained only the songs I wanted to hear and recorded in documentary films during the newer songs. I liked that the band was just five guys on the stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this power, you do not need a circus to be entertained). The crowd's photos were amazing. How many artists can affect the original Beatles fans (now in the 50s and beyond), make the little ones jump to the opening lines of Can not Buy Me Love and influence everyone with each other? While watching, I realized that after John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney became instantly a later idea. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relationships, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he lost his wife Linda and never seemed to gain Lennon's recognition. I agree that the murder of Lennon was horrible, but only now I realized that Paul was something forgotten behind. I was very happy to have found love again in Heather. As for those who complained about audio / video quality, I had no complaints at all; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when it comes out the next format; they will never be satisfied. My only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when we had the chance. Thanks to this video, I was able to enjoy myself. When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember their killing and then the music. Now I have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because if not, he will first be remembered for his music. And hopefully another madman will not change that, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
