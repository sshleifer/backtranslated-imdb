Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her memory of what her youth was like growing up. Tony Shaloub performs impeccable performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not find decent work in America. He is in love with an isolated parrot while performing the duties of a guardian at a laboratory of behavioral science. The Chief Doctor is a bitter man, as Paulie, who can speak and fully understand language and learn, embraces the doctor, who later casts him down to the lower levels of the building where he finds Mikail (Tony S.). Paulie recounts her life with Marie and how they lost each other. The attempt begins to reunite Paulie with Marie, more than 20 years passed. The film ends, some say predictably, with Mikail bringing together Paulie and Marie. The story closes with the three who enter Marie's home, where you can make your final choice. Great Family Movie!
