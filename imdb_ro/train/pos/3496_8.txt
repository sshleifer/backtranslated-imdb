I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars. But they just do not understand the movie. The story is about growing in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren. And there is a good reason why so many critics like this movie. <br /> <br /> And the reason is because they understand the movie. I'm sorry for the low scores of some people. I would just like to write a short summary of a movie, but IMDb asks you to write 10 lines. Honestly, I have nothing to say.
