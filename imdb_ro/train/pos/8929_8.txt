First of all, I very much liked the central idea of ​​locating "intruders", others in the Fragile Self, on different levels - mainly subconscious, but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: in the Swiss-French border, where the protagonist leads the retired life; in his recurrent dream and nightmare; inside his sick body after heart transplant ... In the last half of the film, he becomes an intruder himself, returning to the old French colony, hoping to atone for the past. The general tone is rather bitter than pathetic, full of regret and guilt, the sense of failure being more or less dominant. This is a rather grim picture of an old age, apparently self-dependent, but without hopeless void and lonely inside. Direction composes images more to convey the passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning. Some of them are fascinated, not humorous, however, a kind of absurd game that only visualizes the sleepwalker.
