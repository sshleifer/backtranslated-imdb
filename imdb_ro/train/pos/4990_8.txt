As other commentators have noted, this is an indefinitely timeless film. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave it in Heaven, West, Lifeboat, etc.), it is a tough, well-structured and accomplished move on the denizens of a shantytown in New York. They are worried, beggars and women forced to prostitute, but they are a community of good and bad people, with loyalties as complex as any group. is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill and Trina Loretta Young. He speaks harshly, physically aggressive and obviously fearless ... but Bill is not the character that gives this film a surviving feeling. While he is spinning, Trina actually shakes (if the term can be applied to such a cute character). His devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll pick her up alone if she wants to leave or "I'll give up the baby if you're just happy." This is the dignity of Loretta Young's interpretation (at the age of 20) as a fairly simple character, that he does not seem to be either weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when he finds it and wants nothing more .
