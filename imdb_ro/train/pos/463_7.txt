Of course, the plot, script, and casting in particular are strong in the movie. So many beautiful things to see. One aspect I liked is, in particular, the idea of ​​an antagonist - ex-mentor of Luzhini (ex mentor) who works evil on the edge. His chess opponent - an Italian dandy in three pieces and reed - turns out to be a real gentleman and a really good chess player. In his credit, the "opponent" joins together with the final plan to complete the final game for the postum championship (Luzhin took a flyer on a sad window, but freed himself for it) through the unstable genius "Vaduva Emily Watson.) In death, then, because of the honor of an honorable chess master, Luzhin's defense (which he worked at a late moment of lucidity) is allowed to play. The Italian gentle appreciates the game and calls it brilliant. Talks about a very dramatic game!
