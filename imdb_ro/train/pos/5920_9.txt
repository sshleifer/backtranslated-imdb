American Icon Henry Fonda portrays "Elegant" John Howard, an elderly trucker who refused to lose payments after being detained after a long hospital stay. Deciding to make one perfect cleansing, she gets out of the hospital, steals Eleanor, and joins old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to move her prostitute band. /> <br /> The fabulous performance of Fondas is a natural anchor for a movie that draws on hearts as efficiently as funny bone trauma in more comical scenes. An extraordinary cast, including Robert Englund, as a young friend, reluctant, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-productive credit), and Dub Taylor (a charming sound, as always in the strangest comic part of the picture) helps immeasurably. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the affirmative nature of the image and the pointy of the journey have an incredible weight; this is an image that, if you enter it, you can remember much after it's over. The promise of the open road is presented here alive; the landscape looks just fine. Set to the wonderful score of Craig Safans' music, it is a remarkable aesthetic image. He loses something in his final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions), but he still keeps his vibes thanks to the attractiveness of his central characters. Not at all the exploitation / unity image in the schlock you can expect from the title (especially its 'The Great Smokey Roadblock') is a rewarding cinematic experience I can undoubtedly recommend. <br /> <br /> 9/10
