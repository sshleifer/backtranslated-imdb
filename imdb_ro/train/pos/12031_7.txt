(WARNING: minor spoilers) I fled to this side and followed from there, not knowing what was or was the plot. Surely he kept my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy he used to do the dirty deed went out like a pretty serious guy who just got his head twisted by a tough girl; I have to ask how true the portrait is. Whoever kills a husband and wife while they are asleep, can not be entirely cute. However, I had a sympathy for him, as he had been set up and taking advantage of him; that much has been clarified. My main complaint is with the end (here comes the biggest spoiler, skip this paragraph if you do not want to teach it). A few minutes before it ended, it did not seem that the truth could have been discovered. The way it was discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how was the police convinced to go along with her? The film did not show us that, and it seemed to me a bit too convenient without the explanation of how they were convinced to do it. I think the way they treated this was done for dramatic purposes, the omission of the explanation gave an aura of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise would not have been there (we'd already know what the scene was about and what happened to Brad in she). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a pretty good movie; I'll give him 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested in learning the real facts. One more thing: the film was made in 1996. Some of the comments here seem to be treated as a more recent film. <br /> <br /> PS Lunca Sisto is wonderful. I've never seen her before. It can also act a little (always a plus in the work line, LOL).
