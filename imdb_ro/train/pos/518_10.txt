Also known as "Stairs to Heaven" in the US. During the Second World War, British plane Peter Carter (David Niven) is shot in the battle but survives. He meets and falls in love with the wonderful June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake has been made in Heaven - he should have died! A French spirit comes to accept it, but refuses. He will soon ask for his case before a heavenly court, who should be allowed to live. It sounds ridiculous, but this is actually an incredible movie. The scenario is good with the actors who play the roles quite right and are nicely directed - Earth scenes are in Technicolor breathing (I have never seen such a beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white! Niven is a bit stiff, but Hunter is great (and very nice), and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images over the years are amazing (especially the scale and during the final test sequence), and the special effects are really wonderful (given the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven turns into a totally nude boy, operating sheep! This is an absolutely wonderful, thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the US, which is a shame.
