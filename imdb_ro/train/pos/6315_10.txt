Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but there is none of the following: A star vehicle George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original And yes I know, the basis for the film is another movie. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, this can be classified with the most authentic exits of this decade - and not for me. The film is from the beginning to the end, an absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is not a bad performance in the movie. Funny pieces are funny. Exaggerated parts are nervous. The script contains not a tedious moment of dialogue The cinema is fresh and beautiful. And it does not conform to the Hollywood rule (you'll see what I mean when I see the movie) When I was a kid, I remember seeing commercials for the movie. This movie came under the radar after not making much money at the box office and it's not even classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is considered acceptable by those who approach the film is that they are accustomed to seeing Transformers 2. If the movie is original and funny because it has been pumped as often as many millions of pieces of * * t, a cinematic experience would be a much fresher spot. When "they" say they do not do as they used to, "they did not see Welcome to Collinwood." <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of goat comedy that refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
