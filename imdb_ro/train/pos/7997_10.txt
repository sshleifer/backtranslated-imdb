This is by far one of the best-made films and it has not disappointed me at all. The sound track, along with a handheld camera work, was very refined. There are always chances that a film will not hold conviction, but others, but I felt that the rhythm of this image and the timeline were excellent. Dakota Fanning is becoming more and more a movie that requires a child with an old soul personality and never disappointed me with her talent. As for Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, both overtake the challenge of showing the darkest faces of mankind trying to move to the light.
