"Pet Sematary" succeeds in two major situations. First, it's a terrible horror movie. Those who are not produced these days. Second, it's an emotional and intelligent movie. So if you are looking for chills, scarecrows, fear and amazing visual settings, great action, devils, and terrible effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and really has to see for any Horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation to any of King's novels. Events are a bit hasty compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this undervalued film is not a complete achievement of horror / drama. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is known for being very emotional and frightening at the same time. The film captures the same feeling, especially due to the development of the extraordinary character and the loving relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer skills!) A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the movie, now it becomes very dark. The movie has a sinister sense of credit opening, but after Gage was killed, the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. Confronting the loss of a son is something that can destroy the whole life of the family, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the animal signer is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and despair lead an emotionally destroyed father to give a shot. Unfortunately, the legend becomes real, and the baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous meeting with the animal's signature legend has proven to be a tragedy, but this time is a lot, much worse. What will happen to the life of our American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is Surrealistic Nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to witness one of the most exciting Horror movies in recent times. You will not regret. The act is very good, although I did not dig the actor who represented her father. He did not seem disturbed when situations demanded despair. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby has truly achieved excellent performance and worked perfectly as a noble and delicate mother. The Baby Gage was amazing even on its horrible parts. * Shivers *. Generally, this is an excellent classic of all time and an embarrassing film that touches people's deepest fears ... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a sense of despair. surely ... I do not want to be buried in an animal eater!
