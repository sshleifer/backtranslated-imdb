An excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football stars. How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much can you lose if you think of an innocent girl? Can love beat the chances? Can you defeat the little people in town? When your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make him pay for it or will you be a man about it and respecting her right to choose? Do you turn it around and show it as a victory over a "problem" girl? Can you stand next to the one who is the only sin to have your own opinion, to make your own decisions, to choose for yourself? It made me think twice before giving me judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one is certain - a very disturbing film and theme in general. Thumb sus!
