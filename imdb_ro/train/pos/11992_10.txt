Ever since I remember, I loved the planes and the flight. I am now in college with a private pilot license and I want to become a trader. I never remembered why I was so obsessed with the subject until I hit the old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and hit me, that was it. My parents bought each band they had and that was the only show I would follow as a child. I had the theme memorized as I grew up and I can still recite it today. It's absolutely amazing and I'm going to buy the DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and it's absolutely long. I can not handle this show.
