The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles sounds desirable, because no production can catch the idea of ​​the current Beatles history. Then it is good not to try to recreate the past, but to create an illustration that works best with the available Beatles material. This is exactly what the Birth of the Beatles gives us, the simple story we know without any extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERI here on *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is exactly what some Beatles graduates might expect. The Beatles are seen singing songs that until then were not composed. Beatles interprets "Ask me why," "I love you, and I really do not mind." Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film sang only the songs they made in Hamburg, younger audiences may no longer recognize the Beatles they've learned to know. From the original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" from Stu Sutcliffe are detained. The guys who sing Beatles in this production do not look too much like the originals, but the rest of the film still makes a good view because the movie is for the rest pretty accurate. The guy who plays Lennon is doing well and the rest of the band is no harm. Brian Epstein is great, and the moment he sorts Pete Best in the band is probably the most memorable scene in the movie. Also as a bonus, you will see the original Cavern club in the movie.
