A new part of the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most people's thoughts about Queen Victoria are those of a woman who reigned for decades and lived in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable of playing the main role, as it gives the audience a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne and early years. Blunt Victoria was so fresh and retained throughout the movie. The strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors pay well, including Miranda Richardson, in what might be a throwing role. Although it is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic moments that "act", the story is still interesting to deserve to be watched. There are some historical freedoms that were taken by the script, the film tries to remain true in the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the time period. The set design and the costumes are remarkable. This movie will be most appreciated by those attracted to history, antique and blunt dramas and other actors. True recommendation. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
