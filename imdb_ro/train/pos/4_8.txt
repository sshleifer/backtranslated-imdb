FUTZ is the only show preserved by the experimental theatrical movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Although it is not for everyone, it is a truly brilliant, dark story, often deeply worrying about love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious morality story more relevant now that Congress wants to exclude homosexual marriage through the withdrawal of our constitution. The story is not about being homosexual, however - it is about love and sex that does not conform to social norms and must therefore be eliminated through violence and hatred. On the surface, he tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any other big fab, it's not about animals, it's about something bigger - America's compliance. The scenic version won international recognition in its original production, visited the US and Europe, and others of its kind, influenced almost all the theaters that came after it. Fortunately, I kept the show pretty much as originally conceived, with the original cast and original director Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> And it could change the way you see the world ...
