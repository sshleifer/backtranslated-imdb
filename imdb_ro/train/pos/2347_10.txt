I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies right from the start. He is wonderfully thought out, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. It's incredible how much TV needed a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It's an amazing relief to see a show that is different from the rest, where, if you compared it with some of the latest shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities and tired moments to see shows so close to identity. With a magnificent cast, a wonderful screenplay and a hilarity in each episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most remarkable shows on the TV.
