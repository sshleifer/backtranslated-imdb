If you adapted a book written in the 1950s in the '50s, set the bloody things in the 1950s and not in the 1990s. You see, the motives and values ​​of 40 years do not tend to play as good or sound as if it were true, so far off the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood continues to violate. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been established at the time it was written. You would think he would be crazy, but not. I would elaborate, but bmacv's comment expresses her pretty well. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. He seems to have completely driven his ass for this role. As a result, she looks like a crack on chemotherapy, and it's just as sexy as a sofa in gay skin. I found her "She could die at any time," she looked pretty disturbing, and she'd been very much off of her alleged "hotness" and the "sexual tension" the movie was about to create. Besides, the movie was pretty good; a 7+ out of 10.
