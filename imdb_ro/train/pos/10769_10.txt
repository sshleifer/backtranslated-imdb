I like Monte Carlo and I enjoyed this film. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very character, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as a girl rejected with a golden heart. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as a vivant bon. James Belushi is hysterical as a total robbery. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a vulnerable housewife. Delicious whole ensemble. Lots of talents, smart scenes, lots of happenings and beautiful places. Only a cute guy takes me for a terrible day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is nowhere on your horizon.
