Pierce Brosnan has sampled his last Martini and returns, in a scandalous self-parody, as a mocking, aging murderer, Julian Noble, who has a special love for teenage girls, bullfighting and sticky clothes. During a job in the city of Mexico, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a Denver suburban businessman in the city, to make a living in the hotel bar. Despite some completely different personalities and Julian's cruel and insensitive observations, they become friends. Mostly, through Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he did not write the movie with Pierce Brosnan, but I can hardly imagine this without him. He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene where the two meet in a glossy hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) is really a brave piece of acting skills. The scene takes almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably written with care, the two actors improvise to a great extent, but they are doing great! Almost like a new standard in screen operation. Think Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS, improvising and adding one of the most subtle fundamentals of several gender clich√©s and personal actors (James Bond, especially Brosnan), and you have one of the most delightful couples in the recent Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story wears poorly after a while. After an hour, the film runs out. However, and I can not put my finger exactly, I liked it very much. It feels just fresh and original, with imaginative use of sets and illumination, and some suggestions to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters do not get much to do, but this movie offers something new, in this sense almost manages to mix all conventional genres into a spoof of entertainment. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
