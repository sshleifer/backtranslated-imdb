Michael Cacoyannis had a relatively long career, but he surprisingly got few credits for his name, including some real beatings such as cold satire that did not happen, Fish Day came out. Iphigenia, however, is a climax. Adapted by Cacoyannis from Euripides's play, it is a superior interpretation of classical tragedy and recently made its first appearance on television in recent years in the United States thanks to the Flix channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but it certainly is not a "big" film, with an emphasis on the simple story: in the request of the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) much to the dismay of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both remarkable, but Papamoschou is amazing, bringing the most interesting elements on the screen, combining childhood innocence with the realization that he is the pawn in a political game. Recommended for fans of international cinema.
