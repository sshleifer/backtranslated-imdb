Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle movie. It has all the action, direction, story and entertainment value. All of this fits together, and when it does so, he creates a masterpiece, Fay Grim. This film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to get her son not to grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and disappeared. Soon the CIA contacted Fay in desperate search to find eight magazines of her husband Henry. These journals were full of confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement in the countries and actions of their government. Fay is sent to find these journals in exchange for her brother's release from prison and is sent abroad to retrieve these magazines and find out the secret secrets of her husbands she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked after seeing her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought vivacity to her two comic roles, but Fay Grim was a very different role from the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt it for her, I rooted for her and wanted to know more. It grabs you while it's on the screen and when you can not stop thinking about what's going on with it. I have not seen any other previous work by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I think I will examine some of his previous films if they are as good as Fay Grim. If you decide to make a smart choice for the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD I recommend you choose Fay Grim. If you have a good sense of how a movie should be, you will enjoy this movie very much.
