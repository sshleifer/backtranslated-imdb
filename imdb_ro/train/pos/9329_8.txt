I've seen the Perfect Son about three times. I can not see how this movie is a homosexual film, I'm not even homosexual, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a film with a gay character, I do not see why every film with a homosexual character should be strictly a movie about being homosexual. It seems to me that the film is sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your relative. I think Theo is changing his life pretty soon after rehab because he wants to see his brother dying in front of him makes him reevaluate his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be a father to move a lot, Ryan says he does not want to know about things he will never see or share with anyone. Is not that horrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
