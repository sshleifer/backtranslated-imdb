A typical 90-year comedy, a sitcom comedy similar to our modern day "My Family". Thatcher being the tip of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) accuses Thatcher of everything he can. "Bloody Thatcher" probably shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, cuts his brain with bread knives, Jenny, the older teenage child, only interested in boys and boys. Bill and Ben work as much as they do to keep their family in battle in the economic climate of the early 1990s. Granted the first two series were not as successful as the last, however, the 3 Series is where it begins with all the more laughs that I care to count on. In general, this show did not get the best viewing time and should have taken a little longer. Clearly, he could not have continued after Gary Olsen died, but I think he should get rid of "Catherine Tate," the "Little Britain" office and bring back the classics!
