Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress, which could be the loading force for other actresses to take care of. She has the courage to sit in a rare role encountered by a tough girl, very early in her career (and pulling him), which is a deed that should be recognized. Although her films later claim her in the same role, this film was made for her robustness. Her character is a romantic / fighter / lover student, struggling to overcome her disappointing existence in projects that is a little upset in the movie ... but not by a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story goes in-depth when the heated relationship faced by this girl comes to boil and her primary anger takes over. <br /> <br /> I have not seen an actress have such an aggressive stance in film production, and I'm glad she got that original race there in Hollywood. This film gave me a 7 because of the middle story about the youth of the ghetto, but she has such an actress who has a rare role in a minimal budget film. Good job.
