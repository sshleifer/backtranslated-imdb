Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies of the '70s. It is realistic settings and atmospheres. As usual, the usual negative observations were inevitable. I have noticed that most horror films in a certain period of time often fail to achieve enough. Obviously, because most horror movies are old and must be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of potential music critics here. Before reading the review, you already know what the final judgment was. In the movie a good gift because 10 is very well done. Raines reads quite well and the film, like a way he was produced, reminds me of many Kubrick movies. It really impressed. Excellent movie really. I consider a film anthology in the 1970s.
