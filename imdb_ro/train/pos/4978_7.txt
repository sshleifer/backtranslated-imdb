A short Shirely Temple. The child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Maybe it was "seen and not heard" had to be done. Besides, it's fun. Given the film age, there are certain aspects of this, from a social point of view, which consider me both very progressive and liberal. I will not go in here, I'd rather not ruin it for you, but let you look at yourself and see if you see them. How early it was easy to see from this short fascination that is already developing for the Temple. This is worth watching if you are a fan of the Temple. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while you wait for the good night glass of milk to heat up on the stove.
