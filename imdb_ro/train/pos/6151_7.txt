I will always have a poor spot for this Disney movie, another live action / animation part entry that seeks to recreate the success of Mary Poppins, and has never done it. When I was in primary school, we had the opportunity to watch a movie day, where all the school would enter the canteen, and a movie will be projected in old, multi-role and all-rounder. At that moment, it seemed an important occasion whenever this day arrived, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember seeing this way. And from what I remember, it's pretty charming. Angela Lansbury never put her name at anything that was not at least competent and she wins here as a magic witch (boy who might be misinterpreted, is not she?), Which can take her she and some young children on magical adventures in distant places. Come on, what kid would not want a bed like this? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
