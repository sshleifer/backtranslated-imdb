If I did not want to give anything here, I would say that this excellent technique, without blemish and uplifting action, will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half of fun: he will amuse, surprise, eventually be embarrassed occasionally and almost certainly the trailer to the hearts from time to time, as they approach the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming enemies or predictable in any way. Best recommended. A previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for the remarkable performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I totally agree ....
