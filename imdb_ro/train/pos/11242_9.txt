Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with British musical trends at the end of the seventies, should be sure to look at Breaking Glass at least once. The film, about trying to make a mark in the world of music, captures the perfect times, from open sexism, from difficult economic times to changes in pop culture, from punk to terrible fey and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. The music and fashion styles created every day in the UK in the late seventies are still rediscovered and recycled (there has been nothing new since 1980). It was an orbiting time, and Breaking Glass tells both a very personal story and the cultural landscape, and it is extremely good.
