I did this to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I'm reading now. I will admit that my jaw dropped when the pork chops and the melons began to roll, but people can not look at this film as a stereotypical or racist piece. It's almost a black movie for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated, and the stereotypes of the people involved were the jokes of time, old exaggerated humorous tendencies. We see that modern black movies do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hood" and the like. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'll find that today's films will look just as racist. What the audience should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr., who emerges from his contemporary temple, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same facial as the adult. Everybody involved in this movie had a lot of fun doing it. Why not enjoy what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?
