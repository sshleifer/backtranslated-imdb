In Mexico, the former CIA assassin and currently a decadent alcoholic creator John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), on the recommendation of his old friend, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the cold creature's behavior, making him live and smile again, and feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by criminals, he swears to kill everyone responsible for kidnapping. "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will certainly become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, it's never a horn and although it has a 146-minute execution time, the spectator does not feel when time passes. The cast is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are remarkable, emphasizing Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinema has wonderful moments, and the script has amazing lines. I really like when Christopher Walken's character explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death and prepares the masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, movies of the year in this genre. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
