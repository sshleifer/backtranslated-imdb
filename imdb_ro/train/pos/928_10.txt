I watched how much of the series I could see on TV, but unfortunately I started a job that made me work-nights. I managed to record a few records, at least ... and, of course, I purchased the recently released DVD of the full series. By watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was less raw at first, but they managed to create a fairly large number of defects after the pilot was finished. Voices are very suited to characters, and writing is excellent. It's pretty refreshing to see the animation return to its roots by re-introducing adult themes. The thing is that with the coming of society in the last century, you have to be a little bit more obvious about it today, to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. Characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations parallel to what we often encounter in real life. It's your typical sitcom in this respect, but humor is more like what you would expect from late night TV as a talk talk or Skate Night Live ... when SNL was actually funny. Good job, Dreamworks. Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to maintain this series ... and also to improve the merchandise trade for the series to help cover the high costs. It's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature, though. Hmm ...
