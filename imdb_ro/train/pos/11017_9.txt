This movie was better than the average action movie and in this sense they succeeded. This movie featured spectacular snowmobile and spectacular mountain heights, a very fitting Stallone, but also a good performance, performance from its main villain, because it will really shock you with its evil ways. The movie does not have a high performance of all time on the poor screen of the screen. Plot and story cry for this movie to make Stallone an extra special person, the characters of Rambo or Rocky or Bond. He chose to personalize Stallone's character in this, which is ok but considering the plot style, weakens the excitement factor . Dialogue was also routinely and negligently condescending. Script should have been more realistic and less "talky". Another weak point was unrealistic shooting scenes. Film producers should have been more careful about how they had hits and lost. the quality of the scenes from the shooting sequences during airplane hijacking early in the film. Instead, they decided to collapse a lot of shooting sequences ("A-Team") as soon as the villains have set foot on time. This movie has had a great deal of all time great potential. Crisper action sequences, Better dialogue and more emotion / determination Rambo / Rocky from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level. I know it was not Stallone's fault. The director of the film wanted to attenuate Stallone's character and try to steal the film by taking credit for his direction, which was not so great, if not for his cinematographer.Sill's a good film though ..... ...
