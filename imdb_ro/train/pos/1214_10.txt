It all started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse bringing the club to safety. Noble Horse Heart meets Dawn & John and takes them to see the true heart of heart. Later, the care counter went down and checked the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse to see if the Heart was closed, but I can not go unless the club is in charge, so I ask Dawn & John to take care club. After the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse return, they send Dawn & John back to the camp. Than club bears and cousin grew up to prepare to fight against the dark heart. At the end, the Black Heart kidnaps all bears of care, and the children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that the dark heart is bad. Then they work together to save the bears. Subsequently, True Heart Bear and Noble Heart's horse were shadowed Dark Heart and returned to look after the land to find out they were gone. Children (Dawn, John, & Christy) come, but they were not strong to stop the closed heart. True Heart Bear & Horse Heart Noble come to help Dawn, John and Christy release the other bears of care, but Christy is in the way and was hit by Dark Heart magic. Than Dark Heart saw Christy hit her and stopped fighting with the bear to help her, but she can not because Dark Heart (himself) does not have the power to take care of saving Christy. Care bears and children help the Black Heart to save Christy. Now the Black Heart begins to care and becomes a true boy who falls in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy work in the camp. This is a great move of all time and the best bear care film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like all the movies wearing care and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". Who likes this movie?
