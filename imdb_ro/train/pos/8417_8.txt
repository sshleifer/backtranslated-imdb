While the style of this movie is not as understated and realistic as a sound version would probably have been, it's still a very good movie. In fact, he was seen as an excellent film on his day because he was nominated for the Best Picture Award (Losing at WINGS). I think WINGS is a superior movie, but it's great, despite the fact that he has just passed the lead, Emil Jannings. Jannings is a general of Tsarist Russia who lives in his last days making a few dollars in the 1920s, being an extra Hollywood. His luck seems to have changed as he gets a call - to play a Russian imperial general fighting the Communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not much of a wise-acting stretch, but it also makes the old man think about old times and the revolution. Just what happens next will leave you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as Russian director. Despite the fact that it was made in 1928, makeup does not look much younger than it did in many of its later films.
