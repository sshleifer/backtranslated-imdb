The biggest reason I had to watch this movie was that she named Susan Swift, a remarkable actress and little appreciated. Travel videos usually do not interest me or make movies about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and creepy. He did not rely on scandalous special effects and did not concentrate so much on the journey while the viewer is losing and confusing. It was a truly creative film kept simple and focused with great action from everyone.
