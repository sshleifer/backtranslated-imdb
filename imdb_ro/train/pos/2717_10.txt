I do not remember much about the show, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how I was determined not to miss any episode. Unfortunately, at that moment we did not have a VCR, so I never saw the series again. However, I can remember how I felt while I was watching and how excited I was every time she came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors for today, especially because of his serial appearance. I would love buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to great lengths to see again and review a childhood long gone ... Any ideas? Does anyone know a serials site or has episodes on tape since their first broadcast?
