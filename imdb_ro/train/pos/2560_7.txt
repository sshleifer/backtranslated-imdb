Brando plays the jet needle pilot even back from shooting the MiGs in the Korean War. On vacation, she discovers Madame Butterfly, falls in love. Lovers see both the madness of racism and the cruelty that conservative cultural norms can bring in human relationships. This film is an excellent story, with a beautiful twist that rejects the racist, conservative, dominant times in 1957. "Sayonara" makes you laugh and cry. Be sure that sometimes the musical background will make you want to not be there, although Irving Berlin's title song will attract your memory for a very long time after your theater lights come back.
