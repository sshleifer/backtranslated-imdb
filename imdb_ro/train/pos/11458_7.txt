Greetings again in the dark. Insight in the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... whatever the circumstances, or his reason to live. To see the sculptures of Goldsworthy live and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he has to - not for money or fame. It is his life force. When you see his failures, the energy seems to emerge from the body like a hot air balloon. It's not the fear of starting again, it's taking its energy out of its work. Watching her create just to have a takeover of nature and to remember his work is somewhat painful, yet astounding. He discusses the flow and time in the minimal dialogue, and there seems to be no doubt that the artist and the earth are one and the same. When he says he needs land, but he does not need it ... he wants to differ. Only the complaint is the musical score seems to further slow down a pace that is relaxing at best.
