I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time. His suggestions gave a good idea of ​​the content, and when I finally saw it, I think it was pretty well done. Most of the conventional romantic movies end up with lovers eventually married or start with a happy life after marriage, but there really is a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is all that this film does about the time when a new couple of Fardeen and Esha marry an arranged marriage and start their honeymoon life. The actress is really obligatory, though I think Esha was a little quiet and could have used a few lines for herself. The story was well knit, and the dialogs were more or less suited. Editing and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar did a good job here. To sum up, I'd say it's a love story like a love story, a real combination of what Bollywood can offer a fun artist.
