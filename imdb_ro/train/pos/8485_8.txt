Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and have fun with a frightening comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally fun. Keaton balances pretty well all three aspects of his main character. Wantabedde is even better. A warning: George Wendt is very weak in his role of support. Otherwise, this is a pretty good time capsule.
