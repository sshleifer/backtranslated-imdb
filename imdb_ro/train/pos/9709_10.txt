I first entered LoG accidentally one night while watching television: I have never missed an episode since then. Humor is very strange, like a cross between the single-line Brass Eye's social comments and an amazing plot that seems to develop every week without going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special thing - what was it about? Humor will not appeal to all. Some will say they are too sick and it's easy to see where they come from. However, try. If you do not like it, you do not look at it, but if you like it, you will be very glad you took my advice.
