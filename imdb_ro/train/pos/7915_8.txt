This is a "time odyssey" through computer animation, supposed to be a work of over 300 artists. Made in the late 1980s and launched in 1990, this was a lasting thing for the day. I thought it was good and pretty interesting in places. Most short scenes did not make sense, only shapes evolving in other shapes, but it was fun to watch. It's visual, not a story. There were strange sequences in which odd-looking men dance around with the birds heard. Everything is animated on the computer, which was new at the time. Even the word "computer animated" was not well known. It's simply a chance to show this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. There are no words, just pictures of electronic music. Stoners must have really loved this. It's a beautiful, intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy". With the effects of today's CG, this would have missed the impact, but I think you would be excited about it.
