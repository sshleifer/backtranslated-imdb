I only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago, I thought the frightening moments would be rather taming. The boy was wrong. There are some wonderful moments that sent me trembling on the spine. Even the act was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was gorgeous. The bottom may be slow enough to start, but once it happens, it does not stop. Make all copies, eg. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very loud. I can not say it's Carpenter's best because I have not seen many of them, the only one I can remember is Starman (I think he did). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.
