I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD one day. The episode with Hilton's excentric brother, George (played by young man Roscoe Lee Browne), is classic hilarity. It reflects the classical rivalry and love of brothers whose lives have taken different paths, but both have become happy. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have brilliantly regained the chemistry they have shared in The Cosby Show for many years and have put them in a middle-class role that shows the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> Comedy dynamics list ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
