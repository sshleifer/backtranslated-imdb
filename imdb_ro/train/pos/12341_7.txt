Although the Lang version is more famous, Borzage's work is not without interest, far from it: its "celeste" sequences are even better. The Metaphor of the train (probably borrowed from the end of Abel Gance "to roue") is ultimately more convincing than the "top" world around the world. <br /> <br /> Borzage's tendency for his characters shows in Mary's character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the end of the "three comrades"). the park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in the poor house of Marie. I do not think the sets are so cheesy, they're stylized to a mistake. The fair at a distance almost gives a sense of SF film. Borzage never forgets his social concerns: in the heavenly train he rises, the rich can not interfere with the riffraff, but, as the chief magistrate says, "there is no difference" <br /> < br /> It's not an important piece of work for Borzage (not Lang's version), but to find out if you are interested in the career of the great director.
