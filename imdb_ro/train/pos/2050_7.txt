Everyone has some bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken. In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discovers that the war is over and is heading home when it observes a bunch of soldiers, including Christopher Walken. After a fight Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome, and a short massacre later. Walken and a Colombian guy shared a bill promising something or something. Cut down to the present (1991), and the Colombian man heads a revolution against El Presidente. He is successful at first, but after he presides threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full mouth as a news flash on American television that leads Walken to assemble the old team (even if he was not actually part of that team to start with) to invade Columbia and has shot thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumental film of silly, but for all that is also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies in which the logic has a wide width - how else could Walken pull a combat pilot in the head from another plane without suffering decompression or even breaking a window? It also seems like these guys can drop down dozens of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering. There is a b-movie frenzy to chew here from Michael Ironside, who acts diabolically in Vietnam, to the heroic, but utterly useless, death of one of the heroes at the confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the speech passionate of the rebel leader sister, watching a brown teardrop in my eyes on that television in America, that piece). It's there for a liquid. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can see the crew of the camera.
