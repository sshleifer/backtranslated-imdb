This is a fantastic Casper fantasy from my childhood, and I keep track of it on YouTube (thank you GOD! For You Tube); then I like this short, and it's one of my favorite Casper pants. I like how short he begins to scare with Frank Gallop's haunted narrative; until we get to see Casper sitting next to the tombstone in the cemetery, reading. While each ghost has risen from tombs to "boo" people, Casper decides to go looking for a friend. But trying to make a friend, everyone who sees Casper runs away. Poor Casper sat down in a diary and wept; until a fox puppy comes into madness. Casper and the fox rapide quickly and call the Ferdy cube and consider him his best friend. Casper's and Ferdie's relationship is put in a tremendous danger, however, when Casper does not keep a firm eye on Ferdie while playing a Hide and Seek game. While Ferdie hides a hunter and two hunting dogs come and tries to kill Ferdy and Ferdie runs as fast as possible until he stops breathing and begins to watch. While the hunter shoots fire on Ferdie Casper's observations that he is trying to kill him and that he is flying in the direction of the hunter, he claims that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And hunters and dogs are terrified by Casper. Casper tells Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and everything is fine. But Casper sees that Ferdie's body is not moving and asks if it's okay. When Casper sees that Ferdi has died, he begins to hurt in pain because he has lost "the only friend he has ever had in his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdie and made a tombstone for him next to Casper's corner stone. Casper continues to suffer pain until he sees that Ferdie has risen a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on her cheek. Casper yelled for joy because he was reunited with Ferdie. In general, it is a very good short; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.
