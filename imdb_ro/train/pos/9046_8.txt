I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) and since then I have watched every one of his films arriving on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and even looks like Owen) that rises out of the screen. I feel sure that if he landed in meat roles, he would break an Oscar one day ... It is not at all possible to denigrate this movie. a beautiful story, with very credible people (well, it's based on the early scans of the author with rocketry), a great distribution? Is Chris Cooper always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list? with the proper blend of humor, pathos, excitement ... and the great soundtrack with so many old rock n rolls to get your feet touching. But this film had a very special meaning for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to look at Sputnik as he passed through the black; like Homer, we experimented with rocketry in the back yard and we even used the same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had the most of my finished tests in explosive disaster! What a great fun ... But I did not touch his wonderful heights (metaphorical and physical). But that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it's a dying race these days, it seems. Take time to see it, along with the kids: you all will have many good laughs.
