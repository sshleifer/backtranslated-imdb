Actually, I really like what I've seen in this cartoon so far. Sure, animation is not the best, but, honestly, I would prefer to see this type of carton style made faster and cheaper than the old style made quickly and cheaply (which was beginning to happen more and more - it's just one style that looks good when it takes a lot of time and effort). There's nothing wrong with the angular lines and little eyes with black dots - in fact, I think it's really cute. As a child, I never thought Scooby-Doo's design was particularly adorable, but I think I would love to know better. Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and I think or not, but I think he has the greatest depth potential. Of course, the show does not focus on the original theme "Resolving the Mystery," but still this was just an old tired formula anyway. Do not misunderstand me - I'm sure there are writers who could bring much more interest to Mystery Inc.'s traditional activities. (which lasted until late), but at the same time this is a fun deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but they are no longer just comic reliefs. They are still cowards, but eventually have the opportunity to use the intelligence that seems to be (shock!). These are the same old people who live too much like ever before, but now they seem to feel better with their lives through the legacy of Uncle Albert. I used to find the most original jokes from Scooby-Doo to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best, but this show actually exerts a real humor. I also do not like Casey Kasem like Shaggy anyway, so the new actor does not annoy me as much as other people. (I still think Billy West was the best, though) Generally, while not a great cartoon in the scope of all the history of cartoons, yet another achievement among other Scooby incarnations.
