Oddly enough, all previous comments just described the beginning and left the details. I feel the need to confirm that this is a family work because Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and excellent jazz music was written by Andr√©'s father. Under these circumstances, it's no surprise that it was a very good thriller, seen when it was released and immediately identified with the music. The suspicion was perfect and maintained to the end. Robert Hossein, when one of the best European players, has succeeded in becoming a top-screen and stage director. Still putting spectacular shows, with a preference for religious subjects.
