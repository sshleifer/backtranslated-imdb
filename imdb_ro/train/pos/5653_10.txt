This was an absolutely fascinating series and I'm sorry I only managed to catch some shows back when it was broadcast late night in the UK. His style was so different from others of its kind, and everything had an impatient air of elegant fear. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative one I see) to figure out what was a really innovative series and how it came to imagination. Now I understand from reading the comments I have canceled, it is so incredible. What a bunch of "free cash paid turkeys" should have been (or maybe they still are) running to do that.
