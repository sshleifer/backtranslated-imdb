This is sad that this movie is the charts should be at least in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Today's action movies are badly done Actors and action directors have no way to do this stunt and fight properly. just some not how to do it especially from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The waterfalls are so smart and wild that I do not think we'll see how it ever happens. The start of Chan and his team going on the hillside hillside are just stunning. Fighting waterfalls are, for me, the best fighting stunts ever made in the movie. The end trap sliding down the pole that descended through the Jackie bottle was seriously injured.
