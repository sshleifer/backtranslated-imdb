I really enjoyed this movie because it's a true story in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I think a condensed form of the book was published in Reader's Digest right after the event took place. <br /> <br /> Because I am a baby boomer, the character and actress are my contemporaries and the reason I have referred to the movie. I also think the movie is valid for learning survival skills if the spectator notices the character following the river flows and coastal settlements where he can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important thing was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that the audience will learn something from her and see him for entertainment. I want the movie to be released on VHS and DVD as soon as I want to add it to my video collection. It should also be displayed more often on satellite film channels.
