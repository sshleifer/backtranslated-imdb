Big bad swim has a low budget, indie feel about it. I often start watching independent movies that have had great reviews just to find out that they are pretentious, voted by people who are so blind to the idea of ​​the movie and its potential to be provocative that it forgets that the movie is a form of entertainment First. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the big bad swim has a message or a high meaning or a metaphor, if it does, then I missed it. <br /> <br /> From BBS it got okay, it was easy, hot and humane, there were no major dramas or significant insights, I only connected with the characters directly. And when, as with all good movies, the end came, I felt sad when I lost that connection. If you are looking for big, fast or wise things elsewhere, look for a movie that will try to offer more than it can. BBS offers a solid, enjoyable and real experience, and I felt rewarding and satious looking at it.
