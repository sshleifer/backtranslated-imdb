Yes, it gets the ten stars. It is clear that the day as stuffing is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a weird, odd, weird young one one day, and Harris caught the tape in all the real glory that you can not fake. Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative end could be written for the story of that man. The other two steps in the trilogy tell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young, respectively. The world is expanded and weirdness is contextualized by retelling, giving us a wider look to grow strange in America of vanilla. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
