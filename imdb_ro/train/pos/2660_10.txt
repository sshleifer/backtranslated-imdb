When I started watching The Shining, I was expecting a decent film of what I heard about him and I liked a lot of other Stanley Kubrick works, but when I started seeing him, it was much better than I thought It would be. Sometimes I felt very anxious and could not take my eyes off the screen, but everything was very disturbing about everything in the movie. Now some people do not like Kubrick's The Shining because they do not fully follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both the Kubrick version, the mini-series and the book are all wonderful. Jack Nicholson offers great performance. I'm looking for an original original film that will keep you thinking even after the movies have watched The Shining.
