The director and the two LAURA stars (1944) were fired for this solid policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a murderer who becomes a cop to cut off all ties to the past, but can not keep his violent witnesses in question as he interrogates suspects and one night goes too far; Gene Tierney is a foreign wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has been involved with the city's greatest warrior and Andrews Nemesis, Gary Merrill (who was himself the protector of Andrews Snr.)! As usual, with Preminger, this is a well-done film with a notable succession of credit opening and animated by a good cast including Karl Malden (as Andrew's superior), Tom Tully (Tierney's father, Tierney ) Neville Brand (Merrill's lead role), with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens (Victim of Sneaky), Bert Freed (sympathetic partner of Andrews) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' superior). After being warned by the latter to fix his ways or something else, Andrews panics and makes Stevens a few hours after his murder to put the police on the Merrill tracks (in this case) wrong; Still, after Tully becomes the main suspect (when Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the policeman goes alone in Merrill's flair, which plans to change his mind and "fit" the rake for his own murder! Obviously, the protagonist is a complex character, and Andrews rises to challenge with a first-rate rating, which is usually complemented by the in-house Fox noir style.
