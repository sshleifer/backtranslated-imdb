Breaking Glass is a movie that everyone who aspires to be in the music industry should see many times. It is a very dark story about how a registered company manipulates a singer to do things in their own way and make as much money as possible from it. Looking at some of today's "search for a star" TV shows, both in the UK and abroad, I always remember this movie. Although not an expert on the subject, the winners of these performances tend to have a very large initial kick and then descend from there. The film precedes these shows, although the effect seems the same. After escaping his manager, he played pretty brilliantly by Phil Daniels slowly, but surely the recording company changes her lyrics to put on the incentives and she is finally completely burned. You are the potential stars of tomorrow .... FIND YOU AND BE SAFE!
