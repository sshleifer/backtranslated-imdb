This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the hearts of the viewers, directing this wonderful image in which life is viewed through Paulie's mind and heart. We discover from time to time, with the help of sensible and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. He could not stop tears, even if the film had a happy ending. This is great, after the thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Paulie" really touched me. This is, after "Ugly Duckling", the second image that really turned me upside down.
