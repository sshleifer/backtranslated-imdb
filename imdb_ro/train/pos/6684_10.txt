This is a great movie. I like more every time I look. Most comedies can become quite tense because you know all the gags, but mystery men have so much integrity in writing and characterization that they look once again - like Ben Stiller's tears at limo or Hank Azaria say goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush brightens his choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while watching the news or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. This is a perfect pitch. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all set up payments to the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, look it up again, and if you did not start then. You can not watch it until you first saw it. (Wes Studios, William H. Macy, the scene of the trials, too many good things!)
