Sniper gives a new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or the Second World War, a lot of burning, everyone dies, bam bam. "Sniper" leads war to a new level or refinement. The movie surely conveys all the emotions she's pursuing - Humans helplessness in the jungle, hatred and possible confidence between Beckett and Miller, and the rush of the moment they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-budget film allocates for each flaw with action, suspense and excitement, because when it comes to it, it's just one blow, one killing.
