Referring to current historical events, this blatant, bloody and shocking epic uphearted the viewer's interest, creating a lack of veracity in most of the films established in a distant epoch. Representation of Mrs. Bolkan by the rebellious nun is a tour of force. The gradual transformation of her character from an obedient beholder, if not desirable, into the social injustices of her day, is successfully highlighted by saying the following: her confession about the raucous activity of the duke of the ugly place, the relationship of forbidden love with a Jew , the sensual prince forces Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) There are some painful realistic sequences (human defeat) in this movie that are not squeamish, but the viewers with strong stomachs and interest in medieval history should find a great interest. It's worth seeing, just as an antidote to the Hollywood representations of the medieval world.
