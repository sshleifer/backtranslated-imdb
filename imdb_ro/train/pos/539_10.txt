The first one was good and original. I was a horror film / bad comedy. So I heard that a second was made and I had to look at her. What really makes this film is the character of Judd Nelson and the sometimes clever script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote the Final Destination films and the direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes that seem to have been filmed using a granular back home camera. Great movie made for television. It was worth renting and probably worth buying just to get that lovely cute feeling and watching Stanley's Judd Nelson doing what he does best. I suggest to newcomers to look at the first before you follow the sequel, so you'll have an idea of ​​what Stanley is and you'll have a little history of history.
