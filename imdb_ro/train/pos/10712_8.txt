This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's film). But it's a less charming story and more in the face. And, of course, here is not the father, but his grandfather telling the story. The narrative of the movie moves back and forth (so the sketch of the story from IMDb, I could tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie). It's quite funny and interesting, even if you have a story and another, and you also have dramatic moments. It also captures you here and there, with things you would not expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like this! : O)
