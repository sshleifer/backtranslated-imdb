For 50 years, this comedy musical fantasy could show her age, but she dares it with dignity. This movie is still very fun. Crosby has never been a truly romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the easy humor he needs. Bendix plays wide and is very fun in a part that calls his forces. Hardwicke - how joyous for a knight of the realm - a real - to throw himself in jerks like this with such abandon. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys the slightest interpretation of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints an unconvincing merlin. Although not musical, the songs are very good, and the routine of the "dance" that accompanies nothing busy is not perfect - amusing, fit, dexter without being provocative, and making a virtue of Crosby's musical movement, which, to be honest, was inherently funny, because he is never his greatest power. The color is good, the sound is a bit lucky in places. <br /> <br /> And the story - well, some freedoms are needed with the original, but I suspect Mr Clemens might have been pleased with the outcome.
