Walking with the Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a look back at all the hominid species (which is us!) From the last 5 million years: who they were, how they were, and how they died. Along with being a very interesting scientific insight into the information we have about these species, Walking with Cavemen also analyzes what makes us human. I waited a few weeks to look at it and I was not disappointed.
