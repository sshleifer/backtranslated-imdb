After I went home after the movie, I crawled the familiar drumming music that Natalia and Alexandra danced. I've heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," "I got it the same way I got to the door." Dimitri Shostakovich's "Waltz No. 2 in Jazz Suite No. 2" played by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra Yes, I went and I got the soundtrack from Tower's What are you dealing with? The score of the film by Alexandre Desplat has been fulfilled - there are fifteen pieces next to two pieces of the charming waltz. I'm getting a full-fledged soundtrack these days. Remind me of the favorite scores of Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (the beginning notes of track 6 have traces of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle shades of strings and notes from strings, celestial, piano and harp. Emily Watson and John Turturro have made a credible consuming performance. The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between Alexander and Natalia - the inner world Children and still painful and understanding of generous and bold - a single relationship to both. Director Marleen Gorris from "Antonia's Line" (1996's best foreign language film in Holland) gave us a sensational sensational film - not without human disturbances, intrigues, obsessions, family efforts, love and respect. The front-end subject is the logic of the game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below it, it can be a tearjerker that is easy to set in the late 1920s. Cinema surprises the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. I strongly recommend to soundtrack if you do not feel like you go to movies. Alexandre Desplat's lyrical score from "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
