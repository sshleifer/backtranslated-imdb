It happened to me to see this movie twice or more and I found it well done! The Second World War ended freshly, and the so-called Cold War was about to begin. This film could therefore be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic films that prepare Americans, and secondly people from the "Western NATO" block to be formed to facing the next upcoming threat. The film celebrates the power of the Americans over the centuries as it was projected into the future war that has just come to an end. Beautiful and funny is how to describe the discovery of the American continent of Columbus and the rather "episode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a local drunk indie. I have to see him (at least once for the curiosity of the propaganda fashion through time)! :)
