This movie could have been a silent film; certainly has a sense of one. I was extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase, is a "symphony of love" and transcends all language versions. French, which is the final romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen in this film, which in a way is almost like a sexual fantasy; but certainly far from being pornographic. but this does not distract from the magic spell that this film exudes. Many lovers of early cinema would absolutely love this movie.
