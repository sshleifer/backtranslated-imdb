This film revolves so much around Japanese culture as it makes life a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned for those over 7 years of age (especially in public), therefore everything that leans instead of embracing even when you are close / relative relatives. Dance in the ballroom involves putting your arms around someone else and in public! There is never less dance for the ballroom (quite popular). People doing dances in Japan are a little like western nudists ... much more would want but do, but they are inhibited by culture. A delightful family movie that any amateur dancer would love only for dance sequences. I understand it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are just like the others - they like to be embraced too.
