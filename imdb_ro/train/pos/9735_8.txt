Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people." The story of the plot is mostly driven by a much more interesting story about "cloths in wealth". Although the central line of the story was somewhat urgent, it has gone on in several screen scenes, it has a feeling of; getting "stony sand", focusing on those key relationships that make "office politics" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used exclusively for the comic effect. However, it works so well, especially with Pegg on the front seat. The film is ultimately very intelligent, playing well on the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his co-stars and which blends the cross between high and low society, pretty good and refreshing in a story that, in despite predictability, is somewhat unique. The different characters in the film are well presented and casting is certainly a plus point on the film. Both the relationship between Pegg and Huston's "commercial places" and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that is, for no better word, charming. Even Fox, whose basic hand is, of course, sex appeal, shocks with what turns out to be a dark character and that acts like a bimbo thing all right. One of these films, in which every little detail pays homage to a great work. From transsexual strips to stunning soundtracks, they all fit nicely with what can only be described as a smart comedy.
