Soylent Green is a classic. I expected someone to play it. It seems like the classic science fiction is nowadays (World War) and I hope that a director / producer will resume Soylent Green. With today's animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a wonderful image. Anti-utopian films could not be so charged. People are born as red, without any external influence, to reduce it. We, as humans, have the option of putting kibosh on the procreation of smaller species if they fail, but there is nothing to control human reproduction, except for us. Despite all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race is further multiplied as bacteria in a petri dish. The classical Malthusian economy affirms that any species, including man, will multiply beyond the means of subsistence. 6 billion and rising ... is obscene.
