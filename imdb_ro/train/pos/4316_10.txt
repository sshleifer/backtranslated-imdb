I have to say that Grand Canyon is one of the most affected films I've ever seen. I have followed it several times and still feel the first time; that this film, by itself, could make up the entire curriculum of a postgraduate course in the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Long ago, movie trailers used to promise: "It will make you laugh, it will make you cry." This is a very sad and short method to describe what Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is a sin to move back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror. It's always a short step, too. Just to manage this cradle with grace and without making it look fake or exaggerated is the directorial genius. The spoiler comes in. Once viewers have been accustomed to spin back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from ordinary marital spitting through an accidental knife self-inflicting wound that may or may not require stitching, at an earthquake that has the characters in the house. At the moment of relief, forgotten argument, forgotten finger cut, earthquake survived, a neighboring woman shouts that her elderly husband collapsed. The couple is in a hurry to help them. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw her. Now I cry. There is no sadness that does this to me. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me is that these few minutes of the film was PERFECT. It's perfect! Amazing. (end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is so much to say about the Grand Canyon. They are relatively ordinary people who are confronted with epiphanes and allow the spectator to experience them repeatedly. They are not shown or exaggerated and there is no long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film is heading towards the rhythm of life. Even when the characters try to understand what has happened, they are not sure why to devote themselves to their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human film.
