It comes out of the left field, and REAL is not what you expect. But I like that. The most memorable film experiences come from being surprised if you ask me. If you have not been inclined about the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you are looking for a cure. The distribution is fantastic, but it does not stretch so much that it's palpable. The special effects come from nowhere (seriously, it's like a strange dark comedy romantic until they do it - then WOW) and they are great. General cinema is easy for the eyes, editing and sound are of great quality, and the twisted story unfolds. While none of these things make a blockbuster, "what the hell?" The ALONE factor makes him a film treasure. People who beat this movie do not make sense. It is one of those often overlooked blows of the '90s that you have never heard, or you have not loved so much to jump to mentioning his title. I'm in the last group.
