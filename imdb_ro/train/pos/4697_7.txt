Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerous" in this action on gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is the DA's brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s, catching a child stealing a puppy and then telling him, in retrospect, how he got to own the pet shop. He returned to horde at an early age to make his mother a pancreatic surgery ($ 49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name "dangerous" in the world of mobsters. There are some hilarious scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a revolt like Johnny's mother who needs some organ in his body, replaced. Peter Boyle, as Johnny's boss, offers a very fun performance, just like Griffin Dunne, a direct DA who will not play with the ball with the scary Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout like Moronie, who tortures English - but you have to hear him rather than read about him. What makes funny is that it's all done with an angry face. The movie gets a little tired until the end, but it's worth seeing, and Keaton's great as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this movie was underestimated when it was released and, like Keaton's other gem, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some shows and scenes that are real stones, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" extremely enjoyable.
