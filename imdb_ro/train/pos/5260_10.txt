Yes, it could be stupid and may not seem as fun as many high-budget comedies there, but this movie is really hilarious if you really look at it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as funny outside the Saturday Night Live show. Whenever this character would perform on the show, I would have laughed. So, after seeing I'm going to play Comedy Central one night, I decided to check it out. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie because it was not meant to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but it enjoyed Saturday Night Live fans who like the character Ladies Man. This film is also packed with some highly rated lines that can be recited for the coming years.
