It seems stranger that such a story as "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version) can find DVD distributors, while older and much better works such as this movie are not found somewhere . With all the debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of the war and the interest for espionage (consider the multiple productions of Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible"), it would seem an obvious choice for the DVD is true , it looks like it sounds like a 1968 movie because it's a 1968 movie. But from the point of view of style, it's still a production that actually has something to do with a lot of twists to keep an audience Fun If not, please consider a sound on a kind of CD, whether it's a compilation of other Morricone music or a stand-alone, I do not know if people in the industry are bothering to read what we have fans tell about their products, but if you read this and other comments, please take us seriously. We pay for your rich homes, with hard earned dollars on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! , if you read this and you have not seen this movie, lobby for its release, so you can see what they are talking about those of us who have seen it. You will not be disappointed.
