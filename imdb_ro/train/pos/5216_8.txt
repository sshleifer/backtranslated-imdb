Erroll works for the Department of Public Safety, and his job is to check sexual offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at work and beats sex offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready to retire, so Allison is coming. Erroll is now trained to do his job and is like a shadow of jobs. Allison is somewhat naive about the job from the beginning, but she does not realize how much danger she is and Erroll's fault. He starts to go away with his obsession to find a missing girl when his job is not to be a police officer. It's a decent film about a crazy guy who pushes the borders and works outside his "scope". Erroll did a good job, but for Allison's safety. He has a good mystery and even when I realized it was more.
