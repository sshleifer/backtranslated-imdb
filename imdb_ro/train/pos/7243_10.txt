A brilliant Russian emigrant creates the "Stanislavsky" system to win the bridge - which makes him and his beautiful Sweethearts wife in America. What could be just another telenovela is raised by the fine production values ​​and by excellence acting for the state of a very pleasant comedy. Some unexpected touches are discarded to keep the viewer's attention - the way the distributed principle is introduced as faces on a book bundle; the introduction of an angry acrobat in the plot for another reason than to enjoy a chicory; and how a wide variety of different types of Americans prove to be transfixed by listening to the end game broadcast. Paul Lukas & Loretta Young are doing very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas suave & sophisticated and Miss Young passionate about love and beauty (even if the screenplay prevents them too much on a cigarette). They are fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or convincing. Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a fantastic, cheerful writer who loves Miss Young. Glenda Farrell delights his regular character to lose his role as McHugh's little friend. Roscoe Karns deals with the fast-talking dialogue as a radio announcer. The diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is awesome as a snobbish bridge expert. <br /> <br /> Mavens will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent patron in the nightclub; Emma Dunn as reporter sister crying; Paul Porcasi, as the owner of the Russian Nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the last bridge game - all unbelievable. The film takes pride in the bridge of contract that has swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. The spectator is expected to have basic knowledge of the complexity of the game and does not attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.
