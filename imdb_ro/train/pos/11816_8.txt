It was fun! I never read those Chester-Gould comics, but you do not have to know them. Maybe there were some jokes I did not realize, but what the eye does not see that the heart can not be sad. This is an ironic and colorful movie, and the actors are all together together. The setting is similar to the "Batman" movies, but not as dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising ending. With this movie, you can play an exciting game if you watch it with your friends. Do not look at the credits from the beginning and then look who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are under their makeup!
