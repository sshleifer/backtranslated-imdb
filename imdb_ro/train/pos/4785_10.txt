[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a film by David Lynch, he might have the idea that he describes his enigmatic mind as most of his feature films. But it's a fair story as the title might suggest. All you have to do is get caught up in the usual Lynchian lack of incomprehension that usually appears after watching, Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's really a great movie. This is both innovative and fun. It's innovative, because it's not so Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. She likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a movie that may seem very ordinary and away from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he could only make a film like this to tease his usual audience, because he knows what he expects, but he does not. It would be hard. The pace of the movie is slow. I would almost say the speed of the lawn mower ... Do not expect an orgy of action, but the movie is really fun for those who go with the flow of the movie. Look closely for those little details that Lynch makes in the movie for our entertainment. Look for the wonderful cinema that makes this movie come alive. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that truly animates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin frequently presented. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth puts one of the best performances in this film, making him one of the most liked ol 'people ever described on the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His joy shines through him and his acting brought him an Oscar nomination. Should I say that her poor health in this movie has not been acted upon? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot immediately after the film was complete. This knowledge puts a greater emphasis on the film, as it becomes more a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above forms a very beautiful cinematic image that is suitable for all sorts of people who prefer a movie as they should. It may be that homilies that are not so obvious and naive, but do not destroy the whole picture, because it is a memorable shot. 9/10.
