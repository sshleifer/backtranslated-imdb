RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film, Schwarzenegger. No, it's not 2001, but it's not meant to be. And the script and script here are not even parallel with other Arnie films like PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I emphasize that the IDEA behind this film is one of the strongest who ever hit the big screen. A state sponsored game where criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all sorts of weapons (runners are not equipped with any) to satisfy the public's appetite for sports and blood. Final Prize for a Winner Runner: Freedom. Or, as the rules say. For a movie with such death scenes everywhere and with a single lining, really have a lot to say. Someone has highlighted all the comments about the culture / governance presented in this movie, so I will not go in here. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly sense of the movie, you will enjoy it very much (especially if you are a big fan of SF with a lot of imagination). As I said, do not try to be a serious art film, but it is surprisingly stratified for a 1980s movie. The premise is borrowed from a short novel, Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but it differs strongly from its source material, especially to the end. (The book ends pretty nihilistically, I do not have to say this movie no.) I liked both, but I like the movie better. My favorite line: "Guess it's caused by steroids."
