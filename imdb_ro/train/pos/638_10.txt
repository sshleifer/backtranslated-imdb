For anyone who might think this show is not for them, please try. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clone clones or are reality-based shows that often show some people unreal. This show is a return to family-oriented television where the emphasis is on learning life lessons, learning what are real friends and family and maybe even learning a little about our national fun. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in today's show business, and is perfectly expressed as a young, little naive new batboy for New York Empires fiction (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Grand Winningham and Kirsten Storms have completed the main cast and all are exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch and be seen. We hope it will stay for several seasons and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learn and grow.
