Another Spanish film about the 1936 civil war. This time he tells us about Carol's story (wonderful performed by débutant Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village in New York. It is a journey of initiation, and soon it will find out about the human race's injustices, their stupid struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. Imanol Uribe makes the best film from "Días Contados" 1994) with such sober pulse, beautiful photo and beautiful scenario. He tries not to participate in the conflict, shows us only a few facts and allows us to decide (well, the facts are quite explicit to determine how we form) and has a huge advantage for the young couple's presence and freshness: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-groomed production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
