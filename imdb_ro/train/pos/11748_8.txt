It is hampered. I have to say that at first I was a little disappointed in the first episodes, but with confidence in Abe Forsythe's undeniable performance and talent, I continued to look. I can say for sure that now I am glad I did. The story has developed quite well and all the characters have a strong base, and most do not have information. The only thing they can do in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by Lizzie. A few good things along with a starring plot really have a show along the line. Let's hope another season!
