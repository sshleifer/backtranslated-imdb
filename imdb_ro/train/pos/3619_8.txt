Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a pretty good movie about pursuing your dreams. I was surprised that I did not seem too sentimental; this movie played correctly. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role that says something about a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies have had strangles that bother me; here, everyone shows the side. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict it will do surprising business because it's a G-rated movie that does not require the spectator to stop thinking. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
