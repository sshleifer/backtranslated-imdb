This movie was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). Nice and Simple Writing, who was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, staring at Ruby's everyday life. What we see is a slice in the young Ruby's life. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Best Female Female Award for this role. Ruby begins to live alone and sets his own identity. She explores workplaces, friends, boyfriends, sex, a typical search for young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the Sundance movie. I appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry Hollywood luggage. Although the stories are completely different, this reminded me of the crazy nobody looking at Paul Newman. The later film is a slice of the everyday life of an ordinary man. I like this. The story is very nice and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are not so many bugs and flying in paradise, as there is in Florida. Because I'm mosquito allergic, Florida is not a paradise for me, I'm bothering all over Florida. It turns me into a completely red boiling. We recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her boyfriend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean, who walks on the beach in Panama City, Florida. Indeed, the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite quotes: "The necessity has always been a good excuse". "All the agitation about finding a man is no different now, who will be and when and why." <br /> <br />
