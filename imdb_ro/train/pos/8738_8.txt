A Bugs Life is a wonderful movie that is not just for children but also for adults. The story is set around a colony of ants and their fight against Grasshoppers evil, who return each year and steal their food (A Mirror of the Magnificent Seven). There is a wonderful computer animation, and the voices are great. You will like it !! 8 out of 10
