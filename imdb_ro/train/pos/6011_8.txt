in my opinion, the middle of the movie, especially the scene of love, is a bit too long, but you can always imagine this feeling of desert. but the best, what made this unforgettable movie are the big images of explosions, their color, slowmotion and pink floyd music are unique in the history of the movie! destruction in propper and its popular form.
