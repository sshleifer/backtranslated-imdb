The alternative title of Ecstasy is the Symphony of Love; a title that properly describes the atmosphere and the sense of the film. Ecstasy is an early talk, and it could have been a classic classic if it was released during the silent movie. This film is visual and is deliberately stimulated so that the spectator can enjoy the sensual quality of the lyric, which is presented in an artistic manner at a low level. The director's style is distinctly European. The topic and approach to sexuality were much more sophisticated than what was produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the US census code in the 1930s, which sums up pretty much. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this "symphony of love".
