In my opinion, this must be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single glance than with a whole page of dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie with extra 4 minutes of extra shooting. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely kept her working together for her father in her illegal speculation. Her only connection to anything is her good friend, Chico, who played great by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African-American (and having a white woman to be the best friends with a black woman in the 1930s was as controversial as the subject of this film) and Lily is not, they have a special connection. And it's not sexual. Only two women have been or have been pushed into a situation that could not be controlled by them. After Lily's father dies and does not know what he's doing, he is told he has the power to get out and get what he wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the purpose of the whole movie. Then "they" had to go and ruin in the last few minutes. So, until the last minute of the movie, it's a great movie and it's worth watching. The "lesson" of the film is as valid today as it is then, and I'm sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, note.
