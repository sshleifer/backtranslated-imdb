This is one of the best comedies ever to be on TV. Season One was hilarious as most seasons. The only reason I give this show is 9/10 because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was scenes that cut people's imagination, often representing the characters in famous TV shows or in the 1970s. It's a rare show that I liked every character (except for the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez was not as funny). Red's foot in your comments has never drunk, nor Kelso's stupidity. Bravo to the fox to keep such a good show, so long, too long.
