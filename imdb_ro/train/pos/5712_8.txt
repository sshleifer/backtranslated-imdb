This is an irresistible film of great joy and technically greatly done! The film presents some of the biggest sets of movies you'll ever see in a 30-year film, even if it's too obvious that they are sets rather than real places instead. Often, if a character falls or shakes a door too aggressively, the whole set will obviously move. The best moments of the film were quieter, older, slapstick moments. He shows that René Clair's real heart was in the silent film. General humor is very good in this movie. Of course, musical moments were more than wonderful. This is a very pleasant and simple pleasant early French music. Although the best moments are silent moments, it does not mean that the film is not filled with a humorous dialogue that enjoys the great actors who seemed to me actors of the scene, which, in this case, well for the movie's overall style and pleasant, worry-free atmosphere. No wonder this worked so well, because this film is based on the stage piece by Georges Berr. It's a truly awesome technical film with another great innovation room - editing, which creates some quick and enjoyable to watch good sequences. There is never a tedious moment in this movie! René Clair was such a clever director who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It is a very creative film, which, despite its simplicity, still feels an original and intelligently built film that never has the fun of having fun. The last half hour is especially fun, unforgettable, too much, and is indeed among the biggest as well as the most creative moments in the early movie comedy shooting. The film is full of some really enjoyable characters, of course, all of them are very stereotypical and silly and they were obviously expressed because of their appearance. Everything adds the pleasant and enjoyable atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
