Goldeneye will always go as one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. There is no doubt about that. But this game, though quite different, might be probably the modern Bond champion of his time. It was not a bond game based on materials from another medium. It was completely new; scripted game. Who even had his own theme song! (would not have been bound without it, haha!) The gameplay was great, and if you are a fan of loan games or movies, you will enjoy it. Unlike some / most games, these cast members have portrayed their own characters, unlike fictional creations for the game. Which gives it a more cinematic feeling. With a very capable story, you feel like you're at stake as you lose in a movie. Enjoy all aspects, from start to finish. Even after he played the game, there is still much to be done. With the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its missions for many players, this is a stand-out game. Despite being pretty old now, in the years of video games. It's still a good game you can pick up and play whenever you feel the need to get a Bond more in your life. Right now I just think about it, I got the thematic song in my head. Such a large casket and well-written story. The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and it's just as fun as the game itself. Very well done, in a real way. Which can only be called Awesome, completely Awesome. I have to go throwing this game now. If you have not played it yet, you will lose!
