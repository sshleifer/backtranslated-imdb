I've read reviews about Kerching on IMDb, and honestly, I have not seen a positive review so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, to make £ 1,000,000 for his mother, and has set up a site called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things if only Taj and the two friends - Danny and Seymour can stop the Taja from being exposed. I find this show quite funny and I like to look at it. The actress is OK, but it can definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him funny. and the other friend of Taj, Seymour. Carlton, the owner of the café, also called "The Chill". We never see him, we just hear him. Taj's father, Omar, and Missy's older sister are funny. And Missy's best friend, Kareesha. Often, Taj's almost was almost exposed. In addition to comedy, drama in Kerching, such as the life of love and the loss of loved ones, makes this wonderful program.
