This movie surprised me pleasantly. It has a touching, slightly out-of-center approach that never misses your attention. This is a movie I have never heard of, but if you want a "bedroom," that's it. Great writing, production and action. I highly recommend it to the public who wants some thoughtfulness. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are great. Why was not more of this movie made?
