Adam Jones's "Cross Eyed" movie propels the viewer into a ransom ride, while the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way of empowering his character and updating what matters most. These truths become visible to both the characters and the viewers, while laughing and crunching the credits with them. The simple and appealing settings of your costume keep you guessing about what you'll see next. You can not smile and laugh at the antique that takes place in this movie. I can not wait for his second effort. It's just a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
