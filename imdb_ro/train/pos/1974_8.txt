I think the reason for all the sociable diarrhea in this movie is that most people have it for Sharon Stone to be around 50 years old and getting naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the golden girls stood to eat the cheesecake and talk about their first orgasm, but to see some menopausal post, digitally satisfied while driving, I think it's too much for some to handle. Let's face us, look good, it's lighter than my mother who is the same age! It's not an Oscar or a classic cult as the first, but as early as the century, it seems that all the filmmakers are waiting: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, he never claims to exist. It's an erotic thriller that's both erotic and thrilling, and it's a sequel to a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell, who helped release this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more of this frozen ice queen. Cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian for sure. The score is amazing as well. Sure there are some overacting from some characters, but there is a brilliant work from David Morrissey, which is virtually unknown. There is an obstacle in the fact that the script is basically the same as the first movie that connects only to a psychiatrist instead of a policeman. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be cut even further, which leads to the destruction of the guilty pleasure for which the story is known. At least it's fun and fun to look at it, and that's the only intention of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should see the movie and draw your conclusions before you throw the projectile?
