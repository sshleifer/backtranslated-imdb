I saw this important movie tonight. The most important and best works of Richard Gere and Claire Dane. He deserves an Oscar for the fine portrayal of a man who was forced to retire early as a sex registrant. Claire Danes breaks in as Gere prepares to replace her - a woman trying to teach her everything she can while investigating a final case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of them is tasked to monitor maybe to hold a young girl hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know I'll be haunted by Gere's portrait for a long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins introduced a serial killer has a frightened screen portrait and so he hired me. The movie opens with a shocking statistic so you do not lose your opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's best role in proving that man can act. Danes can also, and they both do extraordinarily well in this often provocative movie. This is a tasty film, and Gere offers a deeply felt multi-layer performance. Give it to the Oscar now ... worth it!
