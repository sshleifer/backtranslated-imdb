On a single level, this movie can take the baby out of us who just wants to build sandcastle and throw things up in the air just to see it fall again. However, on a deeper level, he explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I deeply impressed the artist when he said, "When I'm not here (alone) for a long time, I feel uprooted." I thought Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. I am familiar with her work, especially through coffee table books and art gallery installations. But to see his moving work, perfectly captured by Riedelsheimer's lens, it was a revelation. Undoubtedly, Goldsworthy's creations are coming back, spinning, flying, dissolving, breaking, collapsing. And that's exactly what it is: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Of appearance and disappearance. Exit the Void and become the Universe and back again. There is a shamanic quality about him that is approaching madness. You have the feeling, seeing it at work, that his art is a life force for him, that if he did not do it, he would lose and perish. Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the photo communication environment. Otherwise, except for some cairns and walls, they would only exist for one person.
