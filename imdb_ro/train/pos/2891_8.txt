I watched this on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night and I came to the conclusion that things should be stricter there at Mouse than usual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Since this film has only been running for 74 minutes and had to leave it for 2 hours of television, it has, and does not do, commercial breaks lasting from 6 to 7 minutes . And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the form of a "TV show" hosted by Kelly Rippa, who annoyed so much that he had proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: The Dreams Come". <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Again and again, the break after the break, Disney took the time to get out of the real movie to tell us, loyal spectators, that we need to get a copy of the sequel. Thanks, Disney, because she has done us the job of creating a sequel to the beloved jewel of a movie. However, all this marketing and ringing has made it a difficult task to get into the real Cinderella movie, because until the commercials have finished, we forgot the story. But, of course, the original "Cinderella" still keeps its magic and the story is still a good one, although I have seen it many times. It's a shame that they had to go with all the marketing for what seems to be a follow-up blade.
