Burlinson and Thornton offer remarkable performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although it is believed that at first it is just love, it really goes deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film, placing itself among the best I've ever seen. The horse's scene is absolutely fantastic! Any horse lovers will love this movie! <br /> <br />
