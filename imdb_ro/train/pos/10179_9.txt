De Grot is a very good movie. The big plot comes from Tim Krabbe's novel, which adapted this story to the screen as well. Some top cinemas not only by Van HuÃªt, but also by Marcel Hensema, who mostly worked on television before interpreting Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to be a thriller and sets a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed little by little in a very interesting structure that adds the romantic look and dramaturgy of the film. Ultimately, this culminates in an emotional end that will attract audiences through their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you see this movie. You have to see, especially if you liked "Spoorloos" (original adaptation of the Vanishing screen).
