This is the movie I've seen more than any other (I think I saw it on average once a year since it was released). And every time I see it is as fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was probably a combination of the best shows in cinema ex Yu. This film is an absolute necessity for any filmmaker. In the same league: Marathons trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a movie poker that everyone should have in their private video collection.
