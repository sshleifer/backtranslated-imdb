Paperhouse is the most moving film I've ever seen. Often classified as "horror film," I think it is a serious mistake. Some journalists call it "The Nightmare of the Thinking Person on Elm Street" and, while accepting the logic of his conclusion, I can only believe it is an unbearable and misleading label. Those who can only see horror are really missing here and serve only to prove they do not think at all. In fact, trying to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every refined detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As once someone wiser than me once said, "the film hits you in a completely emotional level," which may explain why my comments are so steadfast. To be honest, I do not apologize for that, so if you feel my words are too sugary for your taste, do not read it now, because there is much to be done. It's so rare to find a movie that has his heart pain and pain from childhood and struggle to overcome terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual is finding child actors who can play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence needed to make it work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspirational cast and Paperhouse's durable impact owes much to their ability to describe melancholy and alienation (often overlooked) in a perfect and convincing way. And yet, both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the studios' understanding and somehow escaped. Add to all of this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), an imaginative cinema and the most beautiful and bloody soundtrack you are likely to hear, and you might start to get a doubt about why I have such a condition and affinity for this movie that no amount of words can express.
