The true measure of any fictitious work is whether or not the characters develop from their experiences and come out of the changed experience in a meaningful way (note that this change should not be positive or beneficial) at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> With this measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success. Being a movie in general, he manages a pretty good overall ensemble, well-developed characters you've been interested in, a great scenario and beautiful sets and locations. In short, the movie is delightful. Although all the shows are first class, three must be mentioned - Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. Something is said when Miranda Richardson does his usual work and yet is shaded by so many others in the cast. The most recommended, especially if you are a romantic to the heart. Further, the Depositor does not say.
