After seeing this movie, I feel I only know a little more about the USA. David Lynch is synonymous with the value of shock and strange for the sake of strangeness, and indeed, these elements are not lacking in The Straight Story. Still, it is in a light that I have not witnessed since Lynch. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but end up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with depths in their lives that can not be obvious from their introduction. Especially the movement was the scene with two veterans of the Second World War who had been discussing the events of fifty years ago and about how it further affected their lives and their current emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not show up here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
