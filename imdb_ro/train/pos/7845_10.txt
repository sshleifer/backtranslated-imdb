So Fox pulled the bush midway through a drama / mystery ... How blade is that? Are we expecting to invest time in their new shows when there is a realistic chance of never knowing what's going on? Why have not the episodes already filmed in the US been broadcast? They were broadcast elsewhere. Fox! Are you listening? It was a great show, but you let us hang. If you intend to introduce new dramas / mysteries, make at least one conclusion before suddenly closing a theme in the middle. Every time that happens (and it seems to be happening very much to you - that is, Fox) there are more of those who will "wait and see" before investing their time. This means you will see an artificially low interest rate and you will probably finish the series. See? It's a vicious cycle. Do not let us down ...
