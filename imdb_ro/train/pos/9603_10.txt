I have one word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater wept. This film presents the hardships Darius suffers with muscular dystrophy. The movie was really done and it really was part of the movie, I was so emotionally moved by the movie, because it made us remember that we are very lucky to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less fortunate than we are. And sometimes we should offer them help and help them all the way. I gave him the ten stars he gave to Darius when they were not asked, did not do it for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know that Darius went westward.
