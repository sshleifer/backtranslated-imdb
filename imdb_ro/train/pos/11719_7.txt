Elvira, the master of darkness, is a fun comedy, a horror camp, in which the fourth wall is broken several times and the jokes are often under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become a character of theirs. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a horror hostess who learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. So she goes to a small town in Fallwell, which is led by the worst monster ever to embrace the earth: the moral comedy. Elviras' statement is, of course, too great for plums, but the children of the city take a shot of her different life. And, of course, there is a more sinister evil, his uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after Elvira's mother's spell book. See, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know that. However, Elvira is a rather funny film, even if the script does not offer much room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and good moral people, but there are also some good visual gags. Along any direction is good, but it never rises more than that. In all, a good comedy, deliberately campy. If you like this kind of thing, that's it.
