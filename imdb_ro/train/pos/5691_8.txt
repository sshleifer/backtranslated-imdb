I was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theater, but I could not get to it. So, finally, he hit the shelves and picked it up. I do not know exactly what to expect, I popped the dvd into the player, settled on a crime night and I pressed the game. What followed was one of the most exciting movies I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> * Some Spoilers * This is the story of the miraculous killing that led to the most messy parts of LA and directly to the greatest pornographic of the 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). I was taken from the beginning and the sense of the film kept going all the way to the very bloody end. I was surprised to learn that the film focused less on real crimes and more on past events and further investigation. In addition to a few bloodstains sprinkled from the beginning and the actual presentation of crimes to the end, the film was more or less a spectacular big-screen debut and great action. Val Kilmer only sells me as a pornographic pornography, and even "beautiful, but that's" Bosworth was a joy to look (and just for her appearance, you remember) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best aspect of the film was, as I mentioned, his lack of showing the crimes completely. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not fully see the brutal bludgeon given to the four sleeping. In addition, the sound effects of those crimes were more than enough to eat my appetite. They were beaten with lead pipes, there is not much to say. My only real problem was the brief appearance of Carrie Fisher. Her representation of the religious figure was, I think, a bit too cliseet of her appearance. Perhaps that person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason Fisher seemed a bit too "akward" in her portrayal. Generally, an excellent movie deserves the watch, even once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
