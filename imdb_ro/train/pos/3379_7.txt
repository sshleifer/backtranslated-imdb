In the 1970s, Charlton Heston starred in sci-fi movies of a different quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the best. He plays the role of Robert Thorn, Detective in 2022, New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn finds the unpleasant truth about this product, he's on the run. I think it is natural for this movie to look dated to us today. But even so, it still raises interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. They also starred with Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).
