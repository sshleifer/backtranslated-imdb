If you read your mother at night and liked so much (like me) that you have to see the movie, you understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story is Vonnegut himself and that you can put the human mind on the screen. His album and humor can not be transcribed by a script or even the best interpretation. I think this film goes beyond the key questions Vonnegut poses in his book, but the frequent satirical moments found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie does not have the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not attempt to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not an environment for those too lazy to turn a page). He succeeds in taking the fundamental elements of a storyline created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presenting it in an unqualified setting. I have seen other versions of Vonnegut's films, in which the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and lose his own boat load. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've ever seen, but it's on my own feet like a plane that's worth watching. Making Vonnegut's voice out of the film's narrative or trying to insert it, however, Mother Night tells her brilliantly and keeps the basic lessons of the story without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.
