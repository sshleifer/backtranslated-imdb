Chris Gerolmo was careful not to give us a "Jack-the-stripper" list of people killed: he went into psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps due to Stephen Rea's excellent performance, playing against Donald Sutherland with a good empathy of both. Was it the game of these two parts? above all ?? who made the film more than a morbid narrative of the Rostov butcher's history. Actor actors, especially Max von Sydow, have very well done their parts. Good direction. And the photo was good. Needless to say that the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was forced to produce a few aberrations, but sincerely, given the depth of storytelling and interpretation, we can completely forget these little trivials. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, a movie made for HBO television came to the trumps. Recommended, especially if you want to analyze the characterization and forget some of the morbid scenes? who, I hurry to add, are never exaggerated.
