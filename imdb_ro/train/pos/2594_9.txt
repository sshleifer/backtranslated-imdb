This film took Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman power. "Wilder Napalm" is a themed film I love, approaching the idea that America's wonders are defined either by gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film shows that every wonderful person is only human and we no longer have to be fearful or venerated than any other human being. This was an extraordinary, fun and humorous comedy with this slight satirical edge.
