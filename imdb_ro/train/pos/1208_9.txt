Every child has that movie he does in VHS when he has nothing to do or when he is a babysitter around him. This was the movie for me. I can tell you the whole plot exactly, probably I've seen it at least 100 times and I can say it's a good movie for kids /> <br /> I still have the band, I did not watch it in 5 years, but maybe I'll go to her this week and be a kid for this day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love the bears and care for their bees
