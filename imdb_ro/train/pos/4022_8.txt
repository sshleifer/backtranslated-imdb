Another detailed work on this subject by Dr. Dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-shared Panjab. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his film's debut. He worked on all the meticulous details to bring the story to life. Treatment of the subject is very delicate. Even if we were not in the region at that time, the sets and costumes are real. Unlike most of the films made on the partition, it focuses not on the violent details of violence to attract the public but also on its subsequent effects. Characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee performed impressively. Manoj Bajpai acted his heart, pointing to the situation of a guilty man. The rest of the cast has done a good job.
