this is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it is very refreshing to look and I have been in stitches several times. I think there is also a social awareness factor that makes this quite interesting. if they were white girls, would they get the same reaction? maybe it would, maybe it would not? the characters do not know limits (check my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. My favorites are the bob of the builder. is so stupid, he is a genius. if you like the twisted black comedy, then this is for you. if you like to keep your appearances, it's probably not 3. It's not a blonde yet a British hilarious BBC comedy on TV! It's such a fun show, and the unlearned characters laugh at the noise! It would be impossible to keep a girl watching the crazy characters and the public's reactions! This series easily adds excellent comedy productions!
