Probably the most captivating installment of the first season, "Shore Coast" has climbs and downs; some parts shoot too much, others are cut out unambiguously, but can not deny that they threw everything apart from the proverbial sink to make it a fun episode. Kirk and the crew seem to have found the perfect planet to leave on the shore after an extended debt trip has left everyone on board needing rest, relaxation and so on. It seems that for all intents and purposes is an uninhabited Earth with beautiful landscapes and an ideal climate. The first clue that things could change a little is when McCoy, leading an advanced team, wins Alice (from Wonderland) after a big white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk knocks down and finds others who report bizarre events and encounters. The only thing they have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person / place / things they discovered just before discovering them. This does not fit right into Kirk or anyone else. There are many strange things, including Don Juan's observations, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 combat aircraft, etc .; Kirk meets with Ruth, a beautiful girlfriend (of course) and a bully of his Academy, Finnegan. The tracking / fighting scene with Finnegan goes too far, but at the same time, McCoy is led by a lance by a knight on a rider and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has happened. The planet is a futuristic "fun park" where visitors only have to imagine something to appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to order coastal leave for everyone after all. Despite the fact that "it was all a dream," the end of Shore Leave is a new episode of the first season of Star Trek.
