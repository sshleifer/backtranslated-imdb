Crime diagnosis was posted in most BBC1 weekends since I saw her while I was sick from school 10 years ago - I know I should not enjoy it in the same way I should not enjoy "" but I'm totally addicted to both and even have DVD sets .... OK I know it's sad! Dick Van Dyke bears the show as he plays as Dr. Mark Sloan of Doctor at LA General Hospital in LA, who is also a police consultant for LAPD - his son Steve (Dick's real son, Barry van Dyke ) is a police officer who needs his father's help for many suspected deaths. <br /> <br /> Along the journey is Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), the resident community pathologist and for the first two seasons you had on Scott Baio playing Dr.Jack Stewart, who grew up and left the series in 1995, hoping to go to bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, made nothing to be remembered since ... and his only theatrical appearance many years has been in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear !!! <br /> <br /> DrJack Stewart was replaced by young Dr.Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter who entered Baio's shoes quite comfortably. <br /> <br /> The series is very implausible but what is the Whodunit series? (Killing she wrote - Jessica goes all over, someone ends up dead, or Father underestimated Dowling Mysteries about a man who resolves killing a priest with a nun) The series was much easier until 1997 because it had a distribution that included hospitality manager Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci, along with Nurse & Mark's Dolores secretary, played by Delores Hall. After 1997, these characters were no longer included, and the series became a heavier business with a larger budget, the episodes included a much larger action, an episode from the entire Hospital was thrown into the air. This was a family show for Van Dyke because, like Dick Barry's son, you had Dick's daughter and all his grandchildren appear in various episodes. <br /> <br /> While the series went on, it became a bit foolish, an episode I remember Dick van Dike playing the whole family, which was a little bit common, but the whole "Diagnostic Murder" a very good television show that had many good stars. Since this show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry again appeared together in the "MURDER 101" TV series made by The Hallmark Channel, beautiful following the same path and still enjoyable. Dick, who is in the mid-1980s, does not seem to change too much and looks as though he is going to work until the bitter end. TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
