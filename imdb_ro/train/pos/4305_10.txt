Grand Canyon is a very weird bird. It is a completely unique urban piece in which the relationship between the entire plot can not transmit too much. The central theme seems to be inherent in the unsafe life of people in every race, background, and station. But to proclaim that the theme of the film would be to ghastly underestimate its scope. Likewise, to sing in a certain genre is useless. The movie has volumes to say, although probably different volumes for each viewer, and it says everything in such a non-preaching manner from so many angles, that in the end I can not even define my central message to me . However, doing business with such laser precision; every projection, dialogue line and a background music bar that contributes to his mood and his strong message, that I am pleasantly surprised and that I am very careful after every viewing. He still does not feel stuck at all. A brilliant film with a big cast and everything that works.
