This is one of my favorite martial arts movies in Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's first films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he has directed. You can see his influences working under Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, the choreography is led by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the bad guys in the film. We're talking about Wei Pei with the "Five Venoms" fame and a host of familiar faces to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The story line is interesting, there are some decent twists, and the building of the characters and the relationships between them is intelligent. This movie only had a VHS version in the UK. Media Asia has released a 3 DVD region and there are DVD versions available from the US. The movie is great to watch either in the original language or in the English version called. I recommend this film.
