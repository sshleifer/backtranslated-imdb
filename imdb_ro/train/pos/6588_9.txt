After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction standstill, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and yet they can only - very much - make it work. The dialogue is good! Male actors are reasonably expert in their professions. Most of the characters are well-drawn, with a special kudos for the hero and a more than pleasant side stroke. And most episodes are just as tasty. So what could be wrong? How about the feminine characters and the perfect cosmetic actresses who are chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on portraying female characters in this series - almost good - in a way that makes the final product look like an unsuccessful cheerleader. Why, I wonder, why? Episodes crash whenever a guest star or a recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are absolutely incredible in their roles, and you do not really have to see that they know they are incapable of fulfilling their missions. An unseen person could say. Just listen to them. They give their dialogue with the drama and the effect of a 16-year-old boy at the high school ball. Who would think these women are doctors, senators, corporate directors and doctors? In a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who will choose - every time? And of course the series suffers for it. Sin!
