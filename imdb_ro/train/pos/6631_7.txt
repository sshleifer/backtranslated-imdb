I have no idea how to describe this movie and I also like to give others the same opportunity I had - seeing it without a prior knowledge of what to expect. I liked it very much, but I can also say that I barely understood what was going on, if in fact it was something to understand first of all. David Lynch's fans (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin should especially enjoy this, and fans of the EIGHTBALL comic book will probably be near to themselves with joy and wonder (they came as close as possible to any movie I have seen on the tone and the mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively). An easy note just to alert someone slightly offended - this movie, if evaluated, would be NC-17 sure. Fans of full-front male nudity, though ... hmm, okay ... yes. There are weird wild things.
