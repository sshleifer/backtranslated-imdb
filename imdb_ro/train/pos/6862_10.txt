When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually answer "have you seen the De Palma Dressed to Kill Seven Art Galleries?" Only that scene represents almost everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a film director, it would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "Pure Cinema" is a way to describe that sequence, and it's really amazing to see how De Palma's entire film works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dream movie, intelligent like hell, and with more delight and intelligence than a dozen of movies put together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: could a movie rely solely on technique and be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to say, the action is great, but it is in the style of the style, and the script has no logic. De Palma's film makes a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon offer superlative performances, but this is the director's film up to fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the shooting environment. I will not tell you which film Hitchcock gives her the tribute to the film (I do not want to ruin the surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the bow of the story and manages to create a film that covers almost all of his career. Not for the weak of the heart!
