Robert Urich was a good actor and makes this TV movie credible. I remember watching this movie when I was 15 years old and when I saw it the second time, my opinion remains the same. People lose what they were when they enter this exclusive club in a computer-rich Californian city. Urich tries to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I like the idea of ​​a glamorous Halloween costume. This movie is about the battle of the sprite. TV quality, which exceeds, big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he has performed in many of his films? I hope so! 6 or 7 of 10.
