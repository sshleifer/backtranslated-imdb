Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you hate and think of suicide as the best thing to do, rather than having to stay on it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cult hit, one of those movies where humor, plot, act is actually very hidden, but for those of us willing to look for it, the reward is: U laugh you are. The fact that U has to find the things mentioned above makes the movie even more fun, because u gets the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny his movie is, what seems unlikely and there is intelligence at the helm of this project magnificent named: Spaced Invaders!
