I have to say that I was impressed by the cinema was amazing, the frames near perfection and the way he built the tension around a subject that sounds more like a horrible hole is beyond being. The film is about two narrators, one seen, one unseen. Both attempt to explain the significance of a series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time ago. The film is about theories and explanations of opinions, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I have to say. Definitely a movie worth more than 171 votes. With only 66 minutes to play this film, the film still felt complete work. Fantastic direction! I have to say a lot better than the Blood of the Poet who, for strange reasons, I remember a little. <br /> <br /> I assume you can call it the word "artsy" with the word slang. There is quite a lot of professional discussion about different theories and stunning visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz pulled it. At least for me. An amazing movie.
