Rookie relies on the true story of a 40 year-old school teacher from Big Lake, Texas, who reaches majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small high school teacher and baseball coach. His team loses terribly until the team discovers that their coach has played in minor leagues and can take a step of 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After throwing a beat and betting, Jim agrees that if his team wins the game they will try for the Leagues. The film tells Jimmy's story being a boy to play in his first major game. It's a great story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worthwhile, offering an emotional performance and is backed by an excellent distribution that includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a little time to develop and some scenes are a bit lethal, but everything works well to the end. Baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed and excellent portraits. The movie is not really about baseball, it's about trying to get a dream come true. It's inspiring, emotional and funny. I liked it, I hope you do it. Rookie. Cast: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
