For anyone who wants to get an impression of the Soviet vision of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story starts at the beginning of the 1900s in the colors of the yellowish sepia of old photographs that improve to black and white in the middle of the century and full color when the story approaches the modern age (1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village that is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. Later, he joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet communism to his village. His son, through local beauty, struggles against the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village, the petroleum industry breaks out and we are treated to a Soviet economic idealism. This movie is long and slow but totally logical and very well done. It can be seen in three parts.
