Dark Angel is a futuristic science-fiction series, placed in post-apocalyptic Seattle, focusing on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically aged young woman running from her creators. (not as much as Buffy says, but absorbing yet) with a set of interesting and credible characters. Of course, it is not for everyone, but those who give it time will look at one of the most enjoyable series there. The dark Angel is overlooked in a murderous manner, and was inadvertently canceled after only two series. Which was a great shame because this had the potential to become a big series, although its 42 episodes are just 10 shyness of the long comedy BBC comedy BBC Red Dwarf. As Dark Angel remains unfinished, look for it, and if you want more, the Fox lobby to make another series.
