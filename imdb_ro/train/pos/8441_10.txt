For anyone who liked the movie series will be something to watch. However, it leaves you even more desire. I liked the way each character (detective) appeared. The least, with the end of the fourth chair, they leave a reason for another movie. I think Bayless, of course. This as well as the series was a very well put together series of scenes. This is a series that I would like to live with. Thanks to the show for a great TV.
