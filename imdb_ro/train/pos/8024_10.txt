When I first saw this movie in the 1980s, I was in the midst of adolescence, and it has been hard for me to see this since I considered myself grown up and out of the age of "Sesame Street / Muppets." Honestly, I do not remember whether I liked it at the time or not. Nevertheless, somewhere in college, I watched this movie again and returned to my personalized "Best Picture" collection. This movie is loaded with humor going further and beyond what Muppets would have expected. I mean, obviously, Muppets always appealed to adults and children, because there is humor oriented towards both generations. But come on ... Janice heard accidentally saying to someone "I do not take my clothes for anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there is a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit Frog, then the father does not want to hear ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says, "I think we're hired now" ... these and more, the moments in the movie made me sense. Add to that very clever dialogue, very smart New York / Broadway humor, "the wink wink", the usual amount of celebrity camouflages, and some really nice songs that do not border with "kid cheesy" ... this movie is a masterpiece I do not regularly throw "10" ... but that's worth it ... More than 20 years later, this movie is totally, maybe even more Muppet has never been and will never be again like it would be fun and smart and simply brilliant as this movie was and is
