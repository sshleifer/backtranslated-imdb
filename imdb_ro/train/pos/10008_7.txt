You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, he's been constantly standing up lately with all the great comedies he's made in this decade (except perhaps "Death at Smoochy," which bombed when he but now it is classical worship). The dramas he has done lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener," despite the mediocre reviews and a fast DVD version, is one of his best works. This story is very refreshing, although it does not include a serial killer or someone who is physically dangerous for that. The concept of the film is based on a real fraud case that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson who suffered terrible abuse and consequently contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read the online reports that Johnson does not exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams presented so brilliantly came back to my mind. Toni Collette probably also offers the best dramatic show as a sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was far from what she had in films like Little Miss Sunshine. There were even moments when he looked into the room where I thought he was looking at me. It takes a good actress to play this role, and this underestimated (but well-revised) role makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation to have never been nominated for an Oscar (since 2008) . It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is so and it is also scary. This is a good and dark film I recommend. Be prepared to be anxious, however, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
