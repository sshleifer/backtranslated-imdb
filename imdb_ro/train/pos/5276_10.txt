I joined IMDb so people know what a great movie is! You often do not see a movie that moves and is visually cinematic but humble. You have read the plot so that all I want to say is that you do not follow it because you want to see a clash of religious cultural identity gawk, because that is the wrong meaning of reading people, but just appreciate and realized that it is a father and son in a growing voyage to get to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it before the movie gets to him. This was one of the few nominated films for BAFTA to be independent and foreign. The beauty is that it manages to appeal to anyone, even if you never follow anything subtitled or simply used for the Hollywood formula, just a wonderful story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I want is for it to be longer and to see what is happening
