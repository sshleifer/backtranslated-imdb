I think if a movie has magic, I do not need to be fluid or seamless. Can ignore background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not diminish the overall positive impact of people watching, helping each other in the areas of life that seem to be the most misunderstood, the hardest to solve. Both characters are smart. However, Stanley can not understand enough to function because he can not read; he can not read, because he has too much adventure in childhood. Iris, though well educated, did not have enough adventure, and so she can not understand how to move after the return tower that her life took. Both in flaws and in their forces, the characters compliments each other. It might be a little stretched to accept that an Iris will finish work a year in a factory, or that Stanley has never hidden his illiterate enough to work in construction or other jobs well paid. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story, their development seems somewhat contradictory. I suppose nobody had time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good movie, imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on the screen if someone had it!
