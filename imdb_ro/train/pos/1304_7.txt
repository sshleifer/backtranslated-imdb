Good. Yes, this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors (such as unique scenes shot in the sun and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso, it was often too good to burn (and at least one actor was used for two different but visible roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (only hair deserves the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some wonderful lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely gentle and uninteresting. Classical? Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Great yes. I would have liked to be fine on the day they decided what kind of hair would Grieco have. "You are fast?" ... "It's not so fast."
