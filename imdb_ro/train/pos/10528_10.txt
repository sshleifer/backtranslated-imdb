I was so impressed with the version of Doug McGrath's movie "Emma," from Jane Austen, and I loved Rachel Portman's musical score so much that when I went to the video store a day and discovered that two gathered for "Nicholas Nickleby" I rented it without any further consideration. I read the book, and for those critically acclaimed fans of this adaptation of Jane Austen, I do not know what else McGrath could have done to better capture the spirit and masterpieces of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations a two-hour movie (which some have been crying for too long!). And as for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I have to confess that I was not too familiar with it when I first saw it at the theater and I was absolutely convinced it was an English actress! br /> I'm surprised by those who criticized the movie for her lush landscape. This is one of the things I like and I look forward to seeing in vintage pieces set in rural England. The beautiful background of the film greatly contributes to its appeal and success. If your travel idea is a bit more grim, then you should rent something like "Death III!" English country settings are just as appealing and charming as the distribution and combine with the story and the entertainment soundtrack that does not make you disturbed your repeated viewing. McGrath is a wonder in choreographing the subplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in transmitting the intricate romantic intrigue that appears in this story. This refreshing film may also be a clinic for how pleasant a film can be minus sex, violence or even a bad antagonist. The story is often funny, weird and sometimes quite moving. I have seen many adapted adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is undoubtedly my favorite.
