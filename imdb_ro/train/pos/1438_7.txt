Full mark for Pacino's rendering of the speech on the coffin of the dead child; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed! Was Paul Schrader or was Ken Lipper supposed to be complimented on remarkable dialogues? They are rich and intelligent and deserve your time if you like the movies with good scriptures. I've discovered the story of the story developing pretty well up to the voice-over. There is nothing else about talking about this movie; even John Cusack played better roles than he did. Interestingly, the film is very oriented towards men - women are simple appendices.
