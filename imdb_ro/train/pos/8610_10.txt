Diane Keaton gave a remarkable performance in this rather sad but funny story that involved quite a few young people and their deep secrets. Diane Keaton (Natalie), "Stone of Family", "05", who had only one daughter and loved her beyond words, can describe. He always called her and told her "Teach Dorothy," an expression used in the Wizard of Oz, 1939. There is a sudden car accident, and Natalie deeply engages in her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, the more truths about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. The great movie to watch and enjoy, especially all the good acting from all the actors who support them.
