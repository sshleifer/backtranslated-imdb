This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who, through an unusual set of circumstances, discovers they are not English, but they are an annex to the French province of Burgundy. comedian actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as a number of other classic comic actors in the era. The story was apparently based on a news article at the time, when the Canadian government "officially" offered a hotel room to a visiting European visitor. The idea actually reminded me of the real case of West Hutt River Province, where a landowner "separated" from the Australian government as a result of a woolen dispute. (It has never been recognized by Western Australian or Australian governments). This is a wonderful script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues, rather like the television show "Yes Minister"; as well as being an extraordinary piece of eccentric characters.
