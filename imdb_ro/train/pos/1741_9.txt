This is a dramatic movie in the full sense of the word. It is said that here, in Greece, we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Of course he has some extremes ... but sometimes, the pain of real life goes beyond art. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the entire social structure built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek lifestyles, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, it's not about anyone, but while you're watching it, you feel that someone puts the best words and possible pictures to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I would not want to hear anymore when it was played during the movie. If someone told me to say something against this film, as a result, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. I think editing had to cut it to fit 2 hours and a little for theaters. Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this but I think u need to see it and talk with a friend. I need to see
