Generally, I'm not a big fan of the stop-motion movies and at first RUKA has not caught my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in repressive Czechoslovakia in the Soviet era, the more I watched the movie, the more I realized how subversive this innocent film was. This subtext really made the film come back to life and give it real power, both as a work of art and through a political statement. The sad little movie is without dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's going on. A cute wooden man makes a clay pot and has a wonderful moment when a moving animated hand suddenly appears and destroys the pot - making it into a sculpture of a hand. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to shake his hand and do his own thing. However, in time, the hand becomes more and more insistent and, ultimately, cries the man. And, after all, the man is dead by the hand that mixes and his hand, in a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man a burial of the hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize the dominating government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs loved the film and gave it a critical praise, the state (that is, the hand) banned this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated more than two decades later during the so-called "Velvet Revolution."
