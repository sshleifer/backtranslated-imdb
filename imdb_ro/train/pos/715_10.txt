All those sitting here and saying that the weak link of this film is Ramones would probably say Amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist. The Rock and Roll High School was centered around Ramones. How can someone follow this up and not take a shot at Joey Ramone eating bean sprout in the backstairs in an attempt to keep in it under performance condition is obviously a wet square-dove blanket. Mrs. Trogar, who explodes white mice, the lobby patrols ... instantaneous classics. Beware of Riff Randell's character. If you do not like Ramones, then you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
