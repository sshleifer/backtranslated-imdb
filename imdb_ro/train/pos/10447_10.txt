There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lives, but for one reason or another we remember those people for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendship take place between people with long distances, and there are always some natural reasons that we no longer meet these people. We do not always know our names because they never offer each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how ordinary humankind makes casual friends and we like to keep it as such, because reunion could spoil pleasant memories or we do not know. We're too afraid to check this out. The movie "Before sunrise" just caught me looking at me. I never had the intention of watching her, but because the conversation between the couple seemed interesting, I glanced at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect, but the young man did not. They had time to talk to each other before the sun rises and everything else happens before they separate. I think this movie had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has lived at least once or twice. It makes us think of all the people we met only once in our lives.
