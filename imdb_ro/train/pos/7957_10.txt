Hey guys, I looked every time I found these two movies and can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I am Australian). You can help and tell me where I can buy it. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. This was my favorite movie wen I was 5 and still is right now when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie, except for my younger sister, because I've seen him many times that she's sick of her. I like this movie and can not wait until I can buy it again on DVD. Sally
