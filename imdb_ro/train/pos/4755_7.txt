A bus full of passengers is blocked during a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge - saying it is unsafe and locked in a small cafe until the road was removed. However, after a while, their boredom is transformed into concern because it seems that one of the passengers was NOT initially on the bus and can only be a stranger! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but rather funny in a low way. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most amusing episodes in The Twilight Zone. Instead of typical overturns or social comments, it does not have a long message. However, it is also very cautious, so who cares ?! Just what happens, you have to see yourself. By the way, he sees John Hoyt - a side that most of you will recognize from countless TV shows and old movies. In almost all cases, he played a real grouse (like Charles Lane at the same time), but the boy liked to see him - as he groomed the grown man and was kind of funny at the same time.
