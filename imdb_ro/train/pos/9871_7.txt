The return to the lost world was filmed back with the 1992 version of the lost world. In this sequel, the same five people, headed by Challenger, return to the plateau where a drilling group for oil, which threatens to destroy the earth, began. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to overcome the drills and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the locals. As in the Lost World, what few dinosaurs we see are rubber and include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner take on their roles as Challenger and Summerlee, and three of the other actors are back. and those inexpensive rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed the return to the lost world. Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
