I have to throw two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, for the most part, the characters are mostly written and acted. I can not think of many comedies I'm not. This is not a new version, it's on video and cable air almost every week. Will I see in a theater? Sure, I did it when it first came out. It's funny ... that should be enough. Even if I did not like it at all, I would have followed him for Michael Keaton's cable. He is an undervalued and undervalued actor. I can not think of another who is so capable in every genre. I can not even think of someone who is successful. A comedic actor who is also a star of action (who has lived a little, but still), which is also a romantic advantage, who is also a dramatic actor; a bastard and a hero. I can not think of anyone, at least not Hollywood. Of course, none that has been successful in all these genres. I mean, it's Tom Cruise, but for me it's better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, it is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'll move on. Gung Ho deserves to rent, to know that it is worth buying because you probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. It's worth looking at the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to watch movies. You can put your brain in a break and relax and laugh. To ask for more, in my sincere opinion, I ask too much for you.
