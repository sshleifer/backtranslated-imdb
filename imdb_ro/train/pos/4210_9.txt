I really liked this movie. All aspects of the film were top, including most important, for me, anyway, script and acting. This is definitely one of the most powerful roles of Richard Widmark. He is absolutely convincing in his performances. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have addressed this role. This is my first exposure to the work of Jean Peter, which I remember. It has so much impressed here that I will certainly be looking for the other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unpleasant role, deserved the Oscar nomination for the role of informant. This movie works on every level. Black and white photography is perfectly suited, and the story attracts the viewer right from the start. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult love. Highly recommended, 9/10.
