Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The star of the second death is nearing completion, and after its completion, it will be a doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's sister twin! I agree to lead the attack on Endor's Forest Shield generator, while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the star of death. Few know that an ingenious trap was set for them, and Emperor Palpatine himself personally supervises the construction of the second star of death. The return of the Jedi is my favorite in the original Trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, extraordinary battles, fantastic Actor, amazing fighting scenes and great music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is now fully matured in a Jedi knight, left is the naive farmer and in his place is a calm and relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play their roles at T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest character of the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the King twisted and brutally ruthless, Palpatine. The action sequences of this movie are breathtaking and sword struggles are serious and pebbles. John Williams' score is still cool and improves the multi-level film. <br /> <br /> Sign, The Collector DVD constant
