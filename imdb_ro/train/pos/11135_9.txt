What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is how Joe Buck gets tied to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hurdles that affect both of them. There is not much hope in this movie for any character, but the tough realities that push both of them give the film its own kind of optimism that these people can even find mankind in one another. <br /> <br /> This film presents the best performance of Jon Voight and perhaps also Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the song is made up of strangers, although it is rounded off by a fine array of character actors, including cowpoke on the bus at the beginning of the movie. Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's disciple, Paul Morrissey, appears briefly during the party. If you have not seen this movie, it's essential. Check it out.
