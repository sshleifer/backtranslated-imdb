I liked this show ... intelligent action, clever dialogue, great story with real people ... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. Hope Davis, it really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​six degrees ... It makes sense in this crazy world. Dare to those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance Please bring it back I'm not bothering you ... but please! When it came out of the air, I looked online and I liked how I could look at it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC Online makes it easy to enjoy shows when you lose them during the first ... gone are the endless shooting days. Whenever you want to get her back, I'm ready.
