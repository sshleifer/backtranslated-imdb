When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered a graphic similar to a Cub Rubik. It is an appropriate image: originally written for the scene by Ira Levin, who wrote such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE WATER STEPFORD, the song being one of the most famous twisters on Broadway, and under the direction of Sidney Lumet translates to extreme screen good . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those movies about which it is very difficult to talk about, so to do so in any detail it takes away the plot for which it is famous. But the premise of opening is extremely intelligent: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mysterious plays, but these days he seems to have missed touch. After a particularly brutal night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a screenplay for a play he wrote. It's called "Deathtrap," and Sidney recognizes it as a safe shot. Just that blow that would revive her career ... really a hit to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events start to twist in the most unexpected way possible. Just as if Anthony Shaffer is spinning equally, DEATHTRAP is really a story at home on the stage than the screen - to get to full power needs the imitation of live performance. However, under the guidance of director Sidney Lumet's expert, it makes a more than respectable display on the screen. Much of this is due to the distribution, which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a really brilliant show, Dyan Cannon is funny and coveted by Sidney's wife, anxious, and Christopher Reeve offers what might be the only unique performance in his regrettably short-lived career. If you can not see it in a first-rate theater production, it will do more than just happen.
