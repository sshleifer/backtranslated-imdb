Page 3 is certainly an eye-catching and very captivating eye-opener that expose the hypocritical lifestyle of the Mumbai elite very smartly. From fake kiss to smiley smiles, it leaves no unclear stone in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal are hiding in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glamor. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert of this world where social Darwinism is the dominant mentality. Everyone is constantly striving to earn more money, more fame and a greater reputation, causing him to do the most shameful things imaginable, from signing the film contracts to a funeral to the deaths of children. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is so much difference between social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both classes through the eyes of the protagonist. Watch the suffocating atmosphere and the wonderful frenzy that social life is all about. Bollywood, business magnates, politicians, and the underworld mingle into a completely confusing mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful piece, as is peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Great movie with great character development!
