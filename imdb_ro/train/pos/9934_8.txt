"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for his frenetic editing and "bad" photo. Decriptions cite superficiality and critique the unfolding of "style over substance". I could not agree. I think "Domino" is the absolute height of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant style of Hollywood's action film in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tony Scott moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. Ever since Crimson Tide, Scott used his stylistic talent to illustrate the inner worlds of his characters - claustrophobia and drama inherent to the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine have been incorporated into the excellent use of long lenses combined with angle-fitting. This was then taken to "Enemy of the State" and "Spy Game", which represented the surveillance and spying worlds. <br /> <br /> "The Man on Fire" was an extreme departure, a move to a more aesthetic expressionist from a pictorial point of view. Here, Scott used an obsolete hand room and flash frames to express the explosive anger of his character. Although he did not succeed completely, he introduced the techniques that were to find his complete expression in "Domino". Coupled with the FBI Interrogator Folding Device, "Domino" portrays infallible bounty hunter's life through separate memory fragments. Understand the memories we all do - fragments, glitters and short beats. While Domino releases his verbal story, Scott reveals it not only illustrating the events he describes, but also the point of view that guides them. She has "mescaline traces" in her system, but her individual vision is anyway unusual - that of a woman who has avoided luxury life for reward hunting. <br /> <br /> It's when Domino begins to relate the events that lead to her captivity that Scott really lets her rip. Together with cinema Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern contemporary American canvas. Gradually, we begin to realize that this unusual, although it may be Domino, is no longer decoupled except culture "90210" which it rejected. As he struggles with this cultural meltdown, Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence he destroys through the disadvantaged children the narrative introduces. Finally, Scott portrays his salvation as the only escape from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this movie for being too stylized is akin to the criticism of a Picasso or a Pollock because it is not what is recognized by man. Like any wonderful painting, the meaning of "Domino" is in the surface, and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I am in no way associated with Scott Free but I have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
