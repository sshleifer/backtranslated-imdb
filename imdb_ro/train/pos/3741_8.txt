The War of War that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. There is a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland - an exact representation of Vietnam on the American soil before they are shipped. He focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... as they meet, become friends and face a squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a border psychologist (Shea Wingham) /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a camera throughout the film and uses digital video for battle scenes. It works very well - the movie looks serious (as it should have) and uncomfortably realistic. Farrell successfully covers her Irish role and adopts a rather convincing Southern accent. His performances are just gorgeous - he is an extremely talented young man. Unfortunately, Davis is not that good. It is tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very gentle. However, the rest of the distribution is great. This movie was thrown by his studio. She did not have stars in it, a famed story, and was considered "just another war movie." He only played for a week in Boston! It works well in capturing video or DVD. Farrell and Davis also have a long nude scene.
