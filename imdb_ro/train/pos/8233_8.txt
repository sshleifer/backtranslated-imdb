Fido is a story about better maneji zombies that have been trained to serve the human race. Everybody collapses, however, when the young Timmy zombie, Fido, eats the family's neighbor. Since then, disaster has occurred (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos). Most people treat their zombies with fairness, and such a character sleeps with zombies (a very funny part of the film, if not very disturbing). And we find the loving Fido what he could do. This is a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent in zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people looking for something fun and different. I have evaluated this 8/10. Rated R for Zombie Violence
