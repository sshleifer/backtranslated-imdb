The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive Sally's spirits is enough to enjoy this movie, but she's waiting! There is! This is a good sense of daytime television noise, movies down the road (and upwards) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr presents the gentle part of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. Dialogue is spiritual, and physical humor achieved with perfect understanding. This is a film that will appeal to those who truly enjoy the art of acting, directing and writing.
