Crying stories: And all the way through the house starts on Christmas Eve when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), pulls her body out, ready to throw it into a well, but at the same time (Larry Drake) dressed as Santa Claus has escaped from a local mental asylum and has already killed several women with Elizabeth on his list but has other ideas and is trying to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to its advantage ... The story Tales from the Crypt was the episode 2 of season 1, directed by one of the executive producers of the show, Robert Zemeckis, and the whole house is a decent watch. Fred Dekker's script is actually based on a story appearing in the comedy "The Vault of Horror," and was originally adapted to be filmed as an episode of the British horror story "Tales from Crypt" (1972), which played the role of Joan Collins character's wife played by Ellen Trainor. This version is pretty good but does nothing different or special and is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic. Just 25 minutes long, it certainly moves along a good rhythm, the story is just enough macabre and generally offers decent entertainment and I liked the end quite a bit. This time, there is Christmas theme for opening and closing the Crypt Keeper segments (John Kassir), supplemented with the usual ones. <br /> <br /> The director of Zemeckis does a good job and there is a pleasant winter atmosphere. There is not much gore here, someone has a poker stuck in their heads, one's face is cut with an ice, one's arm is cut with an ax, and there are some blood splatters, but it's generally not so graphic. Working through a small distribution is pretty good. And all around the house is not the best story in the crypt, but it's decent, however, it's worth an hour, but after the story of the comic book & original 1972 movie we really needed or did we really want that?
