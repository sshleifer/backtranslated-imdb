"Bend It Like Beckham" does not mean too much for us Americans who know very little about former football, but about English sports fans, is the equivalent of "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan". Any young football player dreams to bend a soccer ball around a single player and in the net for a goal, just like David Beckham, the adventurer, does not look like the young Indian Jess (Parminder Nagra) in Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play soccer games like her traditional mother banned. However, while playing one day, a friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try a travel team, all the football girls. After he thanked coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she did the team, something she knew her mother would not have approved. The film does not refer to the disobedience of parents, but rather to a girl who does what she wants to do, even if it is against the culture, not just the parents. There's humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules's mother thinks she's a lesbian. The film makes a moment of clich√©, because the big football game is the same day as Jess's wedding, but it does not come out of a cheese, but rather of fun and light. Soccer action looks good, so fans of the sport will enjoy it and a story about girls growing up in the boy's world, the world of football will inspire some in public. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, but rather a girl who tries to find and make parents at the same time, which proves to be quite difficult.
