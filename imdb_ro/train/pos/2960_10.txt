Well, the main reason that I've given to watch this movie is that it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone at South Park's fame. However, as soon as the movie began, the laughter began to burst out of the belly. From subtle gestures to a joke, to the amazing humor of the toilet, along with a constant dependence on some very cute suggestions. This movie could destroy the event with the worst poker hand, not to mention its poker lingerie. Some of the funniest moments and you will lose the jokes you've ever presented in Hollywood, along with the constant criticisms of themselves in the deal. I'm just going to show that not only is Trey Parker the adherent of writing, he's not too shy about the old game. I was surprised by the amount I absorbed in this movie. However, I am quite concerned that it is not available to buy over the Internet here in the UK. Sort them boys! I am, and I will continue to show all my friends with annoying highlights amusing bits and occasionally snorting in my lager. All in all an excellent movie, if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you have no sense of humor about silly or rude things straightforward! However, I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could make you beat these prejudices.
