I met a Insomniac Nightmare while I was looking for independent movies and I was glad to say I did NOT disappointed. This crazy half-hour walk made me wonder all the way, and the conclusion was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stands with you. I showed it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree with their hands. The little girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. It dragged my mess, I can say so much. Nanavati did a great job to put together this short. All the tracks just got in place and you can say he's a great writer of what he's done with this script. So well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the acting was pleasant, but the most important factor here is the force of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
