This is a wonderful movie from the lost era of reaction drama made for television. My favorite actor, Robert Culp, skillfully describes a trajectory through liberal respect and belief in the system, kneejerk conservatism and fear of murder and murder psychosis. Adolescents are a collection of hideous, shocking stereotypes, and the eventual message of this movie makes Dragnet's episodes look great through comparison. But what really shines in this is the great rhythm of the film, building fear and paranoia in degrees, as well as feeling the whole California qualification. The cars are really wonderful, as I remember. I give this movie a 10, and I hate someone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's made for television does not mean it's not a great art.
