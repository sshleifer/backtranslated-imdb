Deodato brings us some amazing moments and a movie that does not take too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its own way. This film offers a different refreshing look to barbarians. If you have the chance to see this movie do this. You will surely have a smile on your face for most of the time. Not because it's funny or something as trivial as that, but because it's so bad that it goes somewhere and it's good, though maybe it's not pure, fun.
