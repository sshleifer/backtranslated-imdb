This is a movie I decided to go and see because I am a great fan of adult animation. I often find that when a movie does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or a style, it allows the film to be seen as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors' ability to differentiate their styles . <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly more about style than story. While I found the interesting story (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from movies like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was hard to track sometimes and I did not feel that everything came together, it could have. She definitely had a mixed feeling of French animation and Japanese Anime that are coming together. Whether it's a good thing or not, it's up to the spectator. From a visual point of view, this film is an eye treatment and, in this sense, a work of art. If you like the animation for adults or want to watch a movie different from most movies at the moment. I would recommend. All I can say is that I enjoyed the movie experience, but I came out slightly disappointed because it could have been better
