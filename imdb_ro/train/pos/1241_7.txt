This movie is very fun, and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not on the quality of the films. Apart from the profoundly common mischief in some Murphy scenes, the film is a great vehicle for its humor. It has some pretty good special effects and interesting action scenes. As the discoverer of the lost children, Murphy's character begins to look for a missing girl, which leads him on the path that others think he was "chosen" - to protect the Golden Child. The boy is born as an illuminated one, designed to save the world from the forces of evil, but whose life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his wonderful, mysterious and mystical helper / protector. /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lesson to challenge members of the public who are interested in reflecting deep thoughts. Such a scene is the place where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is required to be protected, is tested by monks in the temple of the mountain. An elderly monk has an ornamental necklace for the baby to choose, and the baby is tested at his choice. This is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that there are both good and the forces of evil in our world, about which most people do not know at all. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must leave the contact with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and the walls to fall apart and reveal a field of evil that awaits us to destroy. This is an excellent film with a good plot, an excellent arrangement, and for the most part a rather decent dialogue combining a serious subject with a healthy balance of battle in martial arts and humor to Eddie Murphy.
