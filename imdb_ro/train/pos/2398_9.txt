I really liked this movie. He had a rather dark story - that of Macbeth's of Shakespeare - and wrapped it in a moderate, often funny, funny thread. Kudos to the way the director brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. The opposite world acts to really pull off the plot and comedy of the play, and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a chorus, a part that does not exist in the game, but it even helps to jazz up. The end stands out among the little Indians I have seen for their closure and originality.
