10 ARTICLES OR MORE was made in two weeks on a budget by writer / director Brad Silberling, just a movie shot in Carson, CA, which feels the whole story has been improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was lucky to associate veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different hunters who manage to increase the life of the other. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is described as an actor who has been working for four years, looking for a place for a small filler to return to the flow of things. His role is a market manager and is abandoned on a deceptive market in Carson, where he meets, among other things, a Scarlet, facing the argumentative line of 10 items or less. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry with her husband sleeping (Bobby Cannavale), sleeping with Scarlet's lazy colleague (Anne Dudek) and her lack of get a decent job elsewhere. The two pairs after a few common problems and outside of it go on a "road trip", resulting in each of the characters who grow from the presence and the life story of the other. It's a simple story, she just said, but because of the delicate connection between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those small films about human relationships, in which the vulnerability to change and change is the message. It's good to watch, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to see. Grady Harp
