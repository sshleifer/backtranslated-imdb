"Citizen X" tells the story "Rostov butcher", the nickname for a deceptive and perverted Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who stealthily pursued the killer against all odds in front of a bureaucracy that refuses to self-serve and convenient. An HBO for TV, the film offers a solid distribution, good performance, keeps the audience a lot of horrible details, but plays like a docudrama without a similar Hollywood fare. A simple and direct dramatization of a serious and relatively little story, more exciting than Jack Ripper. (B)
