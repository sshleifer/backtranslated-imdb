Adolescent Eddie spends his life assaulted and humiliated by his obsession with heavy metal. One day he finds out that his hero Sammi Curr has died, allegedly burned by the unit who wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his last record, never been released, and when he plays it, he starts to receive messages telling him how to handle his tormentors. Sammi revealed that he intends to come back to life at the local Halloween party to take revenge in the city that once mocked him. Pleasant with humor and joke, this is a very fun movie. Sammy himself is an original horror film character, playing on the obsessions of "80s rock music". It's worth watching.
