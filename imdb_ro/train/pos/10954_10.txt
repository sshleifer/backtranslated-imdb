Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus is Magic, you will like this. If not, what the hell is wrong with you? Kudos to the Comedy Channel to push this to me. My life finally gets under way, and "your car smells like farts" is my humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and look forward to next week. It's like Grease meets South Park. Totally outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could see seeing the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and oh so amusing. Never pass. Come to think about it, it's not that much choice of material. which is something very good, by the way, as she is choosing to deliver. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
