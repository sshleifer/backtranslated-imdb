James Cagney is best known for his heavy roles of characters and gangsters, but he also played pretty "soft" characters in his career. This musical is one of them and was the first, but not the last, musical movie Cagney would have played. Cagney even makes a bit of singing in this and also a lot of dancing. And it has to be said that it was not bad in this. He plays the role with much confidence. He seems to have had some dances in his early life before his acting career began to take off so much, so it's not really strange that he also took some musical roles in his career. He also feels at ease in this completely different genre than those who are accustomed to seeing him. The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who may have been among the best and most successful directors of the genre. The earliest musicals of the 30 have pretty much defined the genre and also been responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musicals were always light and fun to watch even more comedy than anything else. 30-year-old music has never been related to singing, it has been more present in the musical pieces of the 1940s and then made mainly from MGM studios. As usual, it has a simple and easy story, the musical world, which of course is also predictable and progresses formally. However, it is a fun and simple story, which also simply makes a fun movie to watch. So are the characters and the actors portraying them. Strangely, however, the film's entire line becomes something abandoned at the end of the movie, when the film starts to behave in the routines of the musical numbers. The musical moments to the end of the movie are also fun and well done, even if they are not a big fan of the genre itself. Once again, the musical numbers include a young Billy Barty. he has often played little boys / children / mice and anything earlier in his career, including the "Gold Diggers 1933" musical movie a year earlier. <br /> <br /> A film recommended early on. <br /> <br /> 8/10
