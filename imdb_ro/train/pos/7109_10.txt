First of all, let's start with the negative points: 1) There is a huge crowd that multiplies in the story line and high questions that will not get where almost to be answered; 2) The film is not for all people, the rude spectators will shake and start singing during the movie. The second point above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older theater (like the one I went to), you can hear the drum running through the projector at times. I liked this. The movie does not keep you busy with music and no effects: it lets you reflect on what's happening. There is a lack of rhythm that generates a fascinating atmosphere for total pleasure. The same type of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would highly recommend film fans, because cinematographic work is amazing. Those who base their appreciation of an exclusive movie on the story will be completely disappointed. It is the kind of story you have to do later in your mind. (My version is pretty darn cool, but probably pretty off-track!) If you get the movie, there's a very interesting part: when the two cops talk to each other on their mobile phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that actually puts you at this moment. Removes the person who was thinking about doing this.
