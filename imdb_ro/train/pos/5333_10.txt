How it did not become a cult movie I do not know. I think it was unfortunately a really ingenious comedy! "Runaway Car" is trying to get through like a fast-paced thriller, but the story, the practical aspects of the demonic possession of the car and the baby's evacuation scene, takes the quality of action (good God is bad), nothing but laugh. And you laugh. Movies are made to have fun, and the degree to which they do so can be a proof of the value of a movie. This movie is the culmination of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At some point, I was breathless and almost suffocated, it is really funny at some points. When the child was ventilated from the hatch in a helicopter pedestal with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant speed identical to that of the car and a perfectly flat flight plains that meant that the hook did not break the roof the car in pieces, I laughed hysterically. But when the baby began to spin in the air, it almost hit a bridge and almost got into a tree, my tears broke my tears. I also thought the black policeman was a guy who played Jesus in Madonna's As A Prayer. It seems to be everywhere.
