This is where the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays a guy of Agatha-Christie type murder who closes his nephew through marriage in a vault. Gordon thinks he has killed his niece, and the young man died of suffocation as Gordon travels to New York. He does, however, leave some clues, scratches on some black safes and an improvised and well hidden note. Columbo enters the file, immediately suspects it, and solves the mystery simply by using the mysterious supernatural intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is at hand as Gordon's secretary and will be blackmailer. Hartley is, I think, the great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure her parents had to do with the attractive belly button that's displayed during a belly dance, but I've admired Skinner anyway. The killing is well treated. It's a good plot, and none of the artists or crew do anything. But the remarkable figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a quay over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and was watching her. There are times when she almost teeters, but she constantly emanates charm. Her act is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when it's serious or when you put Columbo and the audience. She also gave some good lines. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo does not have any of his comic moments. <br /> <br /> All this, a good job everyone likes.
