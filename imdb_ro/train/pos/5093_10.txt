The 1985 issue of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones has been modeled so much after Alan Quartermain (or at least a character character by Alan Quartermain) that the 85th director made the mistake of robbing IJ's films for dialogue and story too deep. What you obtained as a finished product was a miserable misery of Alan Quartermain, in an uneven mix of a cheap IJ imitation saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It was called by many critics as a "great parody," or "an unintentional comedy." Unintentional is the word. This movie was never meant to be humor; wizard, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is rather spiritless than spirit. With this new mini M4TV series, you'll have a lot more story, lead character evolution, solid portraits and a fine blend of fun and even fun. This story is a bit long; much more than its predecessors, but worthwhile, so this version has a real story and not just action and Eye Candy. While it contains both the action and the Eye Candy, it corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version, forgetting the IJ together and turning to the source material for AQ, making a well-thought plot, and nicely complementing the sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Now this test is not all the extravagance that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful interpretation of AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa, the audience has a beautiful view (if it is deserted), aboriginal cultures SA and beautiful pictures of wild animals that blend perfectly with performance and story here. Steve Boyum totally surprised me, because I never agreed with his vision. In fact, I disliked most of his directorial work until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less fluke that seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version misses a 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale from ... Fiend :.
