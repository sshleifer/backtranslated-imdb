Stephen King's movies are funny to me. I really love or disoriented them. Some of the productions of fans (like Desperation and the storm of the century) I did not enjoy. Some of the smallest, I even liked it. The Sleepwalker is the one I love and I look at regularly. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shapes that change shape, which, though human, turns into a feline creature like a creature. They're immune to the cats' scratches, and whenever they move to a new town, they put traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their last town, they have to look for a virgin and when Charles finds one, he even falls for her, but his mother has to feed on her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Charles will redeem him or use it to save his mother. Although this story has a nuance of incest that some might find unattractive, it actually plays a role in the story and therefore is not just plunged into the movie for the sake of the scandal. Like most of Stephen King's stories are based in a small town with many interesting characters. The act is not the best or the special effects, however, in a way, everything tends to "gel" and is very visible and pleasant to adapt. For UK readers: This biggest production has recently been featured on BBC1, Sci-Fi, and Sky Thriller / Horror.
