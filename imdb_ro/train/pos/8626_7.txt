"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you happy? The second cult monument of Jörg Buttgereit, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik," is there seven short episodes? one for each day of the week? revolving on suicide by independent people. Between these very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit introduces genuinely horrendous images of a seriously degraded male corpse. Episodes are not all as strong, but, as a greeting, "Der Todesking" is quite high on the list of the most depressing artistic films. In particular, Wednesday's episodes, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park and Sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself as dead are extremely intense and devastating to respect them. The added value of this film or any other kind of temperament is questionable and I'm not sure whether or not Buttgereit had a message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a weird letter in the chain, which encourages readers to commit suicide, but especially we remain uninformed about the motivation of these people to end their lives so dramatically. Totally unlike me, "Der Todesking" is not exploiting or repulsive graphics! On the contrary, I would never have been able to hope that Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful about the image of pure human misery. The Episode of Thursday is a perfect example of this because it looks elegantly different points of view of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of people who jumped on the screen appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor and editing often lacks professionalism, but this is not what really matters in this type of cinema. Is the subject strong and compels us to contemplate the less cheerful? but also indispensable? aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music as well!
