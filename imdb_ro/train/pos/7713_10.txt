Today, SF thrillers are more like Rambo in outer space, with special monster effects (often absurd, such as space-bursting sounds). Though tainted by today's standards, the special effects of the "Forbidden Planet" were quite striking for their time. Even today, they still preserve plausibility. Still, the best part of the movie is probably the reason why radio thrillers still have recourse. Much of what happened was left to the imagination of the public. (What did Krell's creatures look like?) It was never revealed or revealed in the last part of the story, the tension and suspense spent throughout the film. The end was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. In my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) SF films ever made.
