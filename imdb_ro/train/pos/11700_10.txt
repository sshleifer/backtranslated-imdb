I have read most of the comments about this movie. We have seen this film (and the whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and meditated on what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible about the time of kidnapping and the end. No one was scared or traumatized, as I read in some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I've seen a bunch of end-of-time movies, "Tribulation," "Armagedon," and so far and far, this is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. It may not have many special effects, such as today's films, but I think it's a good witness. This movie and its series of prophecies can be seen free from this higherpraise.com site, and judge for you. Blessings to all.
