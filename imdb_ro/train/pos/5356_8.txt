Running Man is not a great movie, it's really bad. But offer what you want in an Arnie movie and that's action and entertainment. I do not see how nobody can enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and above that it almost has its own pleasure. By the way, this is probably one of the most interesting Arnie movies out there.
