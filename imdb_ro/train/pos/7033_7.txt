First of all, I DO NOT call this remake of '63. Even though this version is more true for the scene, it is extremely long. Casting was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good choice. She was almost 30 years old when she made this film and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overcame her role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny like Harry McAffee and showed he could even keep a song. Like the movie '63, they made an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch enjoyed the role of Birdie and showed. I even have the soundtrack and I love listening to the song. So what did this TV rating flop make? It was long for one. They have put together new scenes and songs. Even if some of the new songs were good (such as "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now do not misunderstand me, I liked it, but rather watch the movie '63 (see my review). This was just a case in which some actors overload their roles, making some changes and once again LONG. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give him some lyrics and maybe sing to him. So here is my advice coming from someone who made a series of Bye Bye Birdie productions: If you want to watch a fun get on the track, watch the movie '63. If you want to watch a game that's more suited to the game, watch the '95 version. Just take it in moderation. Do not be a hero and try to look at everything in one session.
