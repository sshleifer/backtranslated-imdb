I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and scared me beyond faith. I would love to review this series and see if it was as excellent as you remember, though I suspect that my taste and requirements have changed. <br /> <br /> Although this has been launched in front of strangers and a lot of other space thrillers, I suspect it has its roots in frightening films of the 1950s and the 1970s political climate. When I think about it, it was a true SF, a movie that tries to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become bleak and has come to be the term for any movie that has spacecraft in them.
