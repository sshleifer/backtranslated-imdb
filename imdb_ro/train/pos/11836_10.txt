This animated movie is a masterpiece! The narrative, the music, the animation and the story in which all are remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw her again for the second time and we got more understanding from us. We invited a couple of friends to see the Spirit with us and enjoyed it very much. When I asked her to come see her, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, who remind me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who is Smiles A Lot in Dans With Lolves. Spirit has meaningful profound meanings and metaphors that we have found to be empowerment and inspiration. I have seen Spirit for the third time and I want to see it again. I liked the Spirit very much, because the portrayal of American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total hoax for portraying American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotyped way. But Dreamworks has redeemed by making Spirit a wonderful movie I found to be acceptable! I hope they will continue to make more animated films, such as the Spirit, and I would like to see continuations or spinoffs to the Spirit if they do respectfully and stereotypically American Indians. We recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Cimarron's Stallion.
