Usually, I'm not a fan of strictly romantic movies, but I heard it was okay. I was surprised. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Amazing. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is impeccable, like writing and directing. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet, you even think you are a couple. <br /> <br /> Movies hurry you right away and do not let you go. You can not look and you can not listen to them. Even small moments will melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has jumped in the ranks of one of my favorites ever. A masterpiece.
