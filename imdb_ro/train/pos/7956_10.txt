This is simply a classic movie in which human voices coming from animals are really what their thoughts are. I do not know if my video copy has a missing scene, but never shows how the dogs came out of the pit. It also shows an instinct for animal survival and tracing skills. People in the same position and helicopters would be out there. Because once an original movie is improved by a remake because the vocal for the first has been eliminated. Only the use of animals can work in a movie of this sort, because the use of people should have increased its story by turning it into a crime, proving that, after all, animals are more interesting than humans
