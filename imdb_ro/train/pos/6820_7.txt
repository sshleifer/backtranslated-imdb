The movie was much better than the other commentator. It's a beautiful family movie. It has a fun fantasy look of a journey in time. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back to the old elevator of her apartment building. Naturally, nobody believes when she tries to explain her disappearance. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her dad in the long run. Reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give her a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be directed more towards children aged 6-12 (maybe a little older) and is pretty much rated PG or G. I'm an adult who can appreciate a beautiful "family" movie - I think the other reviewer is not.
