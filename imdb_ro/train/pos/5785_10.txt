While reading the remaining comments for this show, I could not see that a large percentage of the reviewers did not watch any episode of the show, either through their free will or free will. The Kerching thing! is that it's a children's show, FOR CHILDREN so obvious if your age will look like cheese, forced and probably bad. I even found a person saying the sets were bad, but I remember that at the age of eight, wondering why Taj had molds on ikea's wall and I also wondered if my parents would let me stick something. Yes, it may be annoying, action might be better and some of the characters do really strange things with their hair, but as a show for kids, I miss 10/10. Compared to the things that I bring in its place today, well, just let me say that they want to be re-broadcast. DVD release, anyone?
