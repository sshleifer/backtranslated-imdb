The reason people say that this movie scares them is because they did it! That means the purpose of the movie was felt by some who saw it. When I first saw this movie, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a blood and horror movie, but the way you think it's possible for things to happen just as the movie was written. Of course, non-believers will tell their only SF film. The truth is that this film is a must for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious view. If you are a fan of classical thrillers (Omen .. etc), this is one of them and must have. I've never seen the Distant Thunder, but I think it takes over where the movie ends.
