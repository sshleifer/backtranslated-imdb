This is an excellent movie. There are many things: hunting for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the unity of a man, and the relationship between this man (the lead detective) and his superiors. which is the best thing to do with me is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry misspelling, please!). For some reason, it moves to see its evolution from hostility and crime to transformation into respect and co-operation and working together. One single line in the film sums me up: "He would say something sorcerer, but he is overcome by emotion." The excellent action of all distributions, even the smallest parts, have been made with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast action thriller; in fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it is worth it. Very satisfactory and not exploiting the crimes at all. <br /> <br />
