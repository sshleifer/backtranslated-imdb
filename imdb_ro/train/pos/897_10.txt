What I can say, I grew up in the vision of Hum Saath, Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraya has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraya creates something hard to find. Love and common family that love and wonderful. Vivah is a journey for a couple who is preparing for the marriage that turns into arranging and marriage. Shahid did a good job. I am always brilliant. Amrita Rao gave up something different, although I realized that in a way, another for me does not fit into that role. I saw it in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras and Main ho Na. So you give up a different role where it is not inside. She was excellent in Main on Na and ishk vishk, but maybe she could not have put herself anymore. Anyway, great work goes from Barjatya. This movie strengthens the values ​​I have forgotten. The sweet film of the year. Excellent music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but anyway a brilliant story that's original. Soraj's films were brilliant all the way, so we always expect something different from him. A great job of all crews and everyone. Family movie great to enjoy parents, brothers, friends and lovers. I give him 10 out of 10.
