I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco cinemas when it came out again in '02. I was only 13 years old, but even then I liked it. He had some kind of heat. I've had her on the video for some years, and every time you look at her, she never gets bored. This is due to the fact that one element distinguishes it from all other 3D animations made at that time - the characters have no particular "house" they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to look. Also, every individual character on the surface seems to be simply one with the other, but they are really all good friends. Also, all the characters have their own charm (even the bad guys). Sid, laziness is charming in his annoying, angry and naive way. Manny is adorable in his depressing, exclusive, and so on, and so on. Another important point about the movie is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were originally molded by clay, giving the film an artistic edge. Another aspect that adds to the sense of the film is that genre means very little. There is almost no female character, but you do not realize that until you follow it several times and even then it has little effect on the way you see the movie. Because of this, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in a decoration like the ice age. On the whole, Ice Age is a great movie and proves how much effort has been put into 3D animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
