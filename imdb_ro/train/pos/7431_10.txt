I am and I was very entertained by the movie. It was my favorite movie ever since 1976. Being grown up in the 1970s, I was so in love with the appearance and behavior of Kris Kristoffersons, of course I'm not a film critic, but for the time I think he was very good. I really like the combo of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I have seen the movie several times and still love the two like Esther and John Norman. I'm a really big fan of Kris and I see him concerted when I can. What a talented singer, not to mention, actor. I've seen him in many movies, but still think back to a star is Born.
