I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not only fans of rocker Luciano Ligabue, but all film fans. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover, every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Since most of the Italian debut films are bad, and this, done by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and listen. Because Stefano Accorsi is wonderful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful, talented and good and lost her life because of heroin, which Ligabue looked like, unpleasant and ugly, without to indulge in mild moralism. Because it's a movie that speaks to our hearts, our ears, our souls. And because I experienced the FM radio experience and it was exactly like that. Thank you, Luciano!
