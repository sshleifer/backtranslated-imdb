This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes strange humor. We have incorporated almost as many lines of this film into our daily discourse as we have it from Monty Python. Hobo book game then with Mr. Suicide. The scene from the table and the disgust of the turtle soup. The original Jerk was too choreographed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed to try hard. Jerk Too is a doll and will be enjoyable by anyone. Jerk Too is friendly with the family as opposed to the original The Jerk.
