A good image deserves all the words. This movie has the most poetic scene ever about people with Down syndrome. And I will not hurt her by telling me. You will want to see it yourself. Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not need to understand a single word that he said to understand. <br /> <br /> The film has its own magic. Having looked at it, I better understand that we put too much value on the achievement and is not enough for the people we love. Passion and simplicity are just what we need.
