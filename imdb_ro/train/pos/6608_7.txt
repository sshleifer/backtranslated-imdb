There are about 25 years of inspiration packed into it. Starting with Blade Runner's existential themes, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate boards publishing their products, with Matrix film technology later and Spielberg's AI, and finally the black and white novel looked similar in the Sin City style. Creators have made a lot of effort in the visual department and the result is a neo-noir of the future. Add a detective story and you have an interesting movie. I know what it wants to be, but, no matter what the amazing images, it was not enough to reach the final destination.
