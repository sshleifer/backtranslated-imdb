"Happenstance" is the newest Parisian movie in New York that I've seen since "When the Cat Leaves" (Chacun cherche son chat). "A movie last year has now launched to harness the attention of Audrey Tatou becomes for" Amelie ", his French title is more appropriate:" Le Battement d'ailes du papillon ", as well as summarizing the theory of chaos as a control element of life Our Tatami's Gamina is less annoying here because it only blinks occasionally that amazing smile in the midst of her unfortunate adventures, and because it's part of a vast, multi-ethnic ensemble, it took a long time to solve the characters, especially as some of the cute boys and older women looked the same with me, and some of the characters had fantasized what they should do so I would not be sure if they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I liked how urban were the coincidences, from immigrants to the love of nests in the busy metro stations hanging around the cafes. they were part of a dialogue at a time. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
