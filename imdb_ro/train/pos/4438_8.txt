Director Edward Montagne is doing in a little more than an hour what other, more expensive movies and hype movies can not do. Mister. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. that although it is not one of the best of this kind, it keeps the spectator involved in everything that's going on. clearly a B movie. In fact, the best thing that's going on for The Tattooed Stranger is the opportunity to take a look at how New York looked in those years. William O. Steiner's crystal clear cinematography has either been preserved over the years or has been restored with love. There are wonderful views of New York in the opening sequence. Later, we are taken to Brooklyn at the Dumbo section and later the film goes to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road area with its many monumental shops in the area. John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant expert at the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lord, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a non-speaking role. It was really fun to watch a city as it was, because it does not exist anymore.
