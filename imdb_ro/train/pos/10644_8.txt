The second in the series "Why We Fight" focuses on capturing Hitler from Sudetanland and beyond, as he makes a cock in Neville Chamberlain and launches himself in the conquest of Europe. Clearly, as propaganda on the day, this series during the time test became an informative documentary, and most of the "allied fellowship" became a historical fact. Fuhrer raises his own petard with misleading pronouncements before his people and the world, as one thing says and makes another as his army moves eastward. The Czechs and Austrians catch fast, but the Poles have made a heroic battle against overwhelming odds. The disparity between Hitler's and Chamberlain's military power that waved the Munich treaty as a white flag, declaring "Peace in our time" to date, has sustained propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more strongly, as the darkness of the world war transforms into Europe, leaving the American spectator with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943, there was no escape of this simple truth, and the Nazi Strike made its point of view.
