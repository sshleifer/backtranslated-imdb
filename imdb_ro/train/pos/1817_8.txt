All the dogs go to the sky play the criminal underworld. The film is a delight for children with a comic and dark tale, but satisfying and happy with lots of songs and dancing. She has a renowned Charlie, a murderer who is killed but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him and through this relationship he realizes the significance of life and self-sacrifice. This is a nice love loved by my eyes as a child. I would recommend this movie to children. I'm not sure how adults would react to it. (I tried to watch her a few years ago on VHS, but the record does not last long, is it?)
