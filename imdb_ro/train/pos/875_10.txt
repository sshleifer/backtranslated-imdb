Well, what can I say that I only watched this fantastic movie, when my nerves still jang! Jacques Audiard, the director has to make a name in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise, and Emmanuelle Devos is neither Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors and this is a dark and convincing thriller that starts slowly with a certain intelligent character construction and then begins to put tension on the tension in a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more than anyone in this movie playing their role to perfection, the director, the actors, even to the cameraman, and everything seems so real, not playing a bad game, it happens so of credibility, expressions, emotions, is almost as you are there as a spectator. Do a favor, get the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the lights off, remove the phone from the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
