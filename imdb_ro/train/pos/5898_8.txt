Penny Princess finds American worker Yolande Donlon the heir of a small kingdom in that triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland, called Lampidorra, meet. It seems that Lampidorrans debts are owed throughout Europe, and the country's main occupation is smuggling due to its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can get the title. The nearest heir is Donlan. But, of course, wealth must pass through probes in America and what should Lampidorransii do? Especially since Donlan, now a princess, has forbidden smuggling. Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that Lampidorrans has a kind of cheese that is playfully referred to as Schmeeze. With a few strokes on the road, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. How Schmeeze works, this is a game for the whole movie. But here's a clue. In "The Lover Comes," Jack Kruschen could only keep up with Schmeeze's secret when he was busy inventing a VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. Anyway Penny Princess is a delightful blend of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon plays once again the role that Marilyn Monroe would have been cast if the movie had been made from this part of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well distributed in the early part of his career as a hearty romantic heart long before anyone else, but suspecting he had the act of choreography he had. This movie was sadly presented at 3am on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
