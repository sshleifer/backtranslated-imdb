After losing Emmy for her role as Mama Rose in GYPSY's television version, Bette won an Emmy next year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live live show shot for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who sang live on stage since the 1970s, proves he's still one of the most electrifying live business artists. From her opening number, the classic "Friends", where she descends from her wings over a beautiful cloudy, Bette orders the scene with style and charisma from a rap number called "I Feel Good," then proves she has a joke like other some artists in this business, while she is in a variety of musical selections. The section of the show in which she greets the burlesque goes a little too much, but she manages to incorporate her old jokes Sophie Tucker for the better (though she really forgets a joke in the middle of telling her, but her ad libbling up when he remembers that he is hysterical). Bette also treats us at GYPSY's "Tower of Rose" and the melody of his horror film THE ROSE, as well as a shameless plug for his successful film THE FIRST WAGES CLUB. She brings the house near the end with "Stay with me, Baby" from THE ROSE and her record of only 1, "Wind Under My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a glamorous musical comedy night and Midler fans, it's a must.
