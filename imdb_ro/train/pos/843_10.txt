Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Indeed when it was really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underestimated! Using colors in this movie is something very different in today's cinema world, where each movie has the blueback Payback filter. I also like the way they used the song by Asia. Proving that even what once thought she was a brunette could be very well placed. I made my first look when it came out. Since my movie was a hit-man movie, I had to check out whatever was released. Having seen it, I'm sure it had an effect on me through this process. It was cool enough when my movie received IMDb that would recommend this movie if you liked mine. As any of the others relate, I have no idea, making a more interesting coincidence. Http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
