<br /> <br /> Artistic shootings, actors portray exactly their role. You have a real feeling that Lucienne rises from poverty in the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to triumph again in the tragedy. Overall, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And maybe it's a good thing to say that Prix De Beute is a favorite MAJOR in my silent film collection. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is perfect and I recommend this film Anyone appreciates the artistic beauty coupled with a tragic line of story.
