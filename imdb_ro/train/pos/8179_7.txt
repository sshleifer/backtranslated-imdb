This would have been so fun to see in a theater since 1996. There is a fun corner to my movie taste that really appreciates the very good films made by shock. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is sometimes likely because people usually have strong feelings about dental problems. Perhaps ADA has launched a campaign against him, since dentists say he has to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which only has a scene comparable to "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing to note that, according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. Of course, post-production can take longer than filming sometimes, and editing for "The Dentist" is perfect. Rapid cutting increases tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care of" his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what's going on. The rest is left to our fertile imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role, since he has an "off" psychological experience and has completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. For me, the rhythm of the movie was just right. Producers of the film reveal the wife's displeasure in the right way. All the dental office characters show real people working in a real office. There are plenty of tensions while facing anxious people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is stopped at the top of a huge psychotic malfunction! Unlike so many movies of this kind, the script is very tight. All the victims fall into the trap of the dentist in highly calculated ways. Two types of law enforcement get involved even in a small subplot that ends by creating a shock of a showdown near the end. Certainly not for the weak of the heart or dental phobia, but a real roller coaster ride and highly recommended for fans of smart gorefests.
