I really enjoyed this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in the movie. This film refers to Lindsey who meets Ben in the middle of winter, when the baseball season does not come in. She falls in love, but when the spring comes, she gets the shock of her life when she's stepped down on her pedestal that Ben puts on her. It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben had. He can not separate from what he loves the most, it makes it so funny and why so many women can refer to Lindsey in real life. Also, people with baseball games are as obsessed as they are. It's a funny movie and you will not lose if you rent it.
