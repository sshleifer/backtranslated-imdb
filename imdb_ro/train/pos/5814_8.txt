With all these things going on with MJ, I started to listen to his music, watch the strange documentary from here and there, watch The Wiz and look at Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get some insight into this guy I thought he was very cool in the eighties to think about whether he's guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is a biography part, a feature film that reminds me to watch cinema when it was first released. Some of them have subtle messages about MJ's sense of press and also the obvious message of drugs is bad m'kay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some might call MJ an egoist to agree to make this film, but MJ and most of his fans would say he did it for fans, which if true is really nice to him. The real bit bit feature when it finally starts is only within 20 minutes, so the Smooth Criminal Sequence exclusion and Joe Pesci is convincing as a powerful psychopathic drug. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ listened to his plans? No, the character of Joe Pesci hurt that he wants people to know he is the one who supplies drugs etc. So it does not, maybe he just likes MJ's music. A lot of refreshing stuff in this kind of MJ transforming the car and a robot and the entire Demon Speed ​​sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when he came to film Bad Bad, as directors hate to work with a child, not to mention a bunch of them who have made a complex dance scene. Bottom line, this movie is for people like MJ on one level or another (which I think is the largest number of people). If not, stay away. He tries to give up a healthy message and, ironically, MJ's friend in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to have the grace of this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I gave to this topic ... hmmm well I do not know because people can be different behind closed doors, I know that for a fact. He is either a very nice guy, but stupid, or one of the worst liars. I hope it is not the latter.
