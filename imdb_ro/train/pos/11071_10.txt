Give ten out of ten is one of the best movies ever. Absolutely crushed, amazed and amazed by the whole picture, the wonderful play of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the entire crew, an amazing plot ... Look at yourself and get your courage to admit - touched your soul, for that's odd, but there are all the answers you've ever been looking for ... Best, sir. Ritchie! VERY BEST. Those who were looking for a fiction and a simple struggle continue to shout that they are disappointed. But in Hollywood, there's a lot of superficial movies, you can not remember what it was about the day you saw him. On the contrary, the Revolver is unique, and I could hardly wait to imagine a clear and brilliant picture of mine, of all those who were about to look at it. Absolutely unmatched, astounding, dazzling ... It can be seen, I do not doubt that. In fact, no word can express my admiration ... Still asking me how it was possible to film such a movie after years of dirty Hollywood rubbish I was following. Thank you wholeheartedly, it's just the best.
