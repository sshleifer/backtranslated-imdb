This James bond game is the best bond game I've ever played in my life is my favorite James game so far because: The missions in this game are very fun, they can be very hard, which makes it the more fun to play missions have a lot of actions the guns that you are using are very good. The cars in this game are great, the car missions have a lot of action and are very fun to play. The voice on the actors is very good and it is very bad that Sean Connery makes the voice for James bond also how the look of bond is very cool because it looks just like Sean Connery when he played James bond in the movies and the other character looks pretty much the same as the look in the movie. Graphics is pretty good in this James bond game. Also, the game follows the movie pretty much, but not all, but often it does, which is cool. General score ********** from ***** *****
