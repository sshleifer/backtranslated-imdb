This is an evocative and idealistic portrait of Lincoln's early life (born in 1809 in Hodgensville-Kentucky - and died in Washington in 1865). Ford's excellent film takes Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied law, the common law and began practicing as a lawyer in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his cabin days, the initial relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), following the couple from their first ball and his departure for the candidate at the congress. But it mainly focuses on brothers (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) accused of murder, the subsequent trial with funny debates in court and protection for their mother (Alice Brady). Lincoln-Fonda as a defense attorney and prosecutor Donald Meek are not brilliant at all. Henry Fonda's excellent performance as an idealist seeker, traveling to Springfield, he was to play regularly for Ford in this film, ¨But of anger, my dear Clementine and Fort Apache ¨. Apart from the fact that Sister Alice Brady was a loving mother, she was a great actress in the silent cinema, but this is the result of her latest movie because she died of cancer early. Developing Lincoln's actions make appealing fun. nostalgic desire for past and old things and describes his goodness, righteousness and will. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a simple man who never varied the ideals of his youth. This American masterpiece is fair in both ways, as a splendid biography and as a magnificent drama. Other biographies about Abraham Lincoln are: 1) "Abraham Lincoln" (1930) by DWGriffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, from his birth to his assassination; 2) "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" (1940) by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey, Ruth Gordon, about events similar to Ford's film career as a lawyer; 3) TV version entitled "Gore Vidal's Lincoln" with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore Mary Todd.
