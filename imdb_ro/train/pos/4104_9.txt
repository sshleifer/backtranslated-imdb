It helps you understand the Czechs and see this in the original language and understand the Czechs' obsession with "Professionals", but if not, "Jedna ruka netlaska" is still a great Czech film. It's funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The biggest compliment I can pay is that you never know exactly what will happen next, and even keep this feeling in your second and third views. For a small country, the Czech Republic produced an amazing amount of world-class film and literature from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor, by its very nature, is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This movie is just that she is unhappy and takes care of the least appealing parts of human beings, but underneath it there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. and most other projects involving Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for this reason - anyway, it's just as close to the people will ever come to write a really happy ending ...
