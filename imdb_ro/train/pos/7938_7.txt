Rob Estes, Josie Bisset, and a bad load of kids who do not show anything like any of them. Basically, Rob and Josie have a wedding rifle on a drunken night during a Vegas holiday. Everyone comes home to find out that they already know brides because of tabloids that are not so fodder. Well, Rob and Josie, both move the eight kids in the house of one or the other. Rob builds, I think, furniture that is close enough to Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy) construction work much more similar to guarantee an eternal mug. Josie is a kind of cookie maker queen, though he does not seem to do any cookies. It's not quite close to Carol Foster's hair dressing service (Suzanne Somers), which justifies the resemblance to power, but quite hilarious to justify the mockery of atrocity. Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holiday, and they actually knew someone else's name, or so it's supposed to be serious enough for a relationship to make a trip together. However, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should have called Andrew Andy. <br /> <br /> There are lots of placement products, especially for soup at hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid and meaningless moments. It's also not a great movie to promote happy families. But, hey! Rob Estes! This ends my review of "Step by Step ... on some very bad medications." Look at Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes. There are some nice pictures!
