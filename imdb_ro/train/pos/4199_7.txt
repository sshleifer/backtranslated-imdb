The only thing about this movie that bums me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment or I'll buy it because the movie is a good example of a noir movie ... and I like to see Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. Criterion produces excellent DVDs, but sometimes the price is just a little bit more. This is the case for a 80-minute black, mono film that is good, but not extraordinary, cinematic. The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a Widmark pocket, which inadvertently ends with an espionage microfilm in its possession after being hit by his bag Peters. (say three times!). Everyone, except Peters, is a credible character in this movie: Widmark, police officers, US agencies. and Communists and, above all, Ritter as "Moe," an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film. Peters makes a decent job to play in the cheap flames, but he loses his early credibility by "falling in love" with Widmark at his first encounter, even if he's hated for her. Only in the movie world! Too bad, because that story of ridiculous story goes away from her. This average noir film, which means good, but not great, and certainly not worth holding for $ 25- $ 35. For this price, it can do much better in the noir movie market.
