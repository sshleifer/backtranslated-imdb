hi .. I think Dous Cause one of my favorite films by Sean Connery, is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from Cast, especially Connery .. it also has one of the best lines I have seen in movies so the dialogue is pretty good in this .. It also has one of the best scenes ever in the movies when Sean enters the character of Ed Harris in jail is just fantastic .. I enjoyed a lot of this and can not recommend this enough, really do not rate it! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that say the last 30 minutes sucks, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, they just find Just Cause a very interesting movie.
