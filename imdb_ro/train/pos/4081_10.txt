I've seen almost all of Miyazaki's movies and they're all beautiful and captivating. But it rises above the rest. This movie impressed me altogether! I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet and caring friendship. It was what the movie made for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings of the movie perfectly. But the characters are the brilliant point of this film: they are so well-developed and full of personality. Now, let me clarify: I really talk about the Japanese version of the movie (with English submarines). While the English double is good (especially), it feels bad compared to the original linguistic version. Voices are better, dialogue, everything. So I suggest you see (and hear) the movie as it was originally.
