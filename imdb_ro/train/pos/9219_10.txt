The movie itself made me want to go and call someone to enjoy it. It was very funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet. Parents are hilarious. They are both suppliers and enemies. The children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the play of the church. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them away (Spoiler Ahead, I think). after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like the stereotypes and classical literature, do not look. If you do not mind, you will have a forgotten explosion on it.
