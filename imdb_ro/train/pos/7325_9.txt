John Carpenter's Halloween is a real masterpiece of horror. She tells the immortal story of the mental patient Michael Michael who went to his hometown on Halloween night to eat and kill a group of babysitters. It was the first and undoubtedly the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great retention in the very slow pace of storytelling and the building of pleasant characters; unusual for a horror picture. Even more unusual is the lack of blood and gore, and yet it remains the most frightening Halloween to date. Take this! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked Jamie Lee Curtis's debut film and a defining point in Donald Pleasance's latest career. A real classic.
