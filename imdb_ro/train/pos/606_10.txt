I saw a lot of Saura movies and I have always found amazing how he assembles the music, dance, drama and great cinema in his films. Ib√©ria presents a better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that has attracted my attention is that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are just as important: the camera presents various aspects of music interpretation, examining not only the technical problems but also the emotional experience of the game . Saura's interest on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is an additional element in transforming this film, the most interesting of its other works. That's why I strongly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
