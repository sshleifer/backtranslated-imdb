This movie was as good as some of the other Westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This movie begins as a run of the west mill, but becomes more complex as it goes on. Begin with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle, and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent, but the cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart agrees to drive something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about taking his cattle back. As the movie goes on, it's as if Stewart cares about himself, just like his character in Naked Spur. She gets much better halfway after arriving in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's best westerns.
