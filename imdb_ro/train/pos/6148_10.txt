IN LOVE MEMORIES BY DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) When I looked at this film for the first time I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of a witch in the Second World War. The scene that impressed me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was an exception to see this army without a physical walk to fight with the amazement singing their march. This movie is fantastic, from my trip to Portobello Road (which has become the most fantastic place in London) to the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always great, it seems she is a good aunt of a family, and David, with her face always amazed, is her great co-protagonist. we will miss you very much.
