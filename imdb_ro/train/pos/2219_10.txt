This movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few African Americans are aware of. My two children are through the products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the free couleur gens and a black leather woman whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from all his family, except for one sister who pity her brothers; raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; giving the family food whenever it could. Of course, she has clandestinely helped this family to fear its own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We were part of our library.
