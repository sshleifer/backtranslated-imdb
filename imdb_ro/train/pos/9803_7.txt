This Batman movie is not as good as Batman's mask of Phantasm and Batman and Mr Freeze subzero But it's still a good rate at cartoons Batman say it's as good as Batman Beyond the movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The story is good not as good as the other but still pretty good has a lot of action in it Cartoon effects are good The voice of the actors is very good, such as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. Bastards are good, such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed by Batman Mystery of Batwomen. So make sure you rent or buy the Batman Mystery of The Batwoman movie because it's really good. Overall rating: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
