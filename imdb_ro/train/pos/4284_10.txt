This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate representations of the mentality, which seems to have once again crossed the Balkans, 45 years after the moment it was described. All the common characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughter would be the most appropriate answer. However, the precision of the portrayal and the timelessness of the guys makes it a great movie to see if anyone wants to understand a little of what led the former Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with this region should try anything until they saw this film and the two Marathons trce pocasni krug. Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
