Abe Lincoln's early career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that someone alive has seen pictures of true Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a false nose, is unusual like Lincoln, with his voice, delivery, strolling and other manners - just as we would have imagined that Lincoln would have been. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he has made with Fonda, is at the top of his shape, evoking America perfectly at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder defended by Lincoln, and scenes in the courtroom are pretty well done. Supported distribution includes many of Ford's usual. This was the last film of Alice Brady, who died months after his release.
