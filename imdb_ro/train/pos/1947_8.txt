Spoilers. Like other posters, I felt the end was a bit steep. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting life back to earth after their return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by frontloading some Voyager to the earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all.) I liked Admiral Janeway's death for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have the cake and eat it, making Janeway make the final sacrifice and live. I admit that Janeway's scenes and older ones who had conversations were bizarre and could cross the line into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (i) withdrew him.
