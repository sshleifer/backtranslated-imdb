This movie is an excellent example of wonderful stories. The actor is superb. The story is inspired without being too manipulative or false. There were a couple of points that probably made people better or worse than they really were, but considering it was a Hollywood movie, they showed a stunning hold. There was no single explosion in the movie, even though they only had one chance. The film, while having tense parts, was not turned into an action movie. The story is made to focus on an extraordinary man of old, unfortunately, the usual. Very good!
