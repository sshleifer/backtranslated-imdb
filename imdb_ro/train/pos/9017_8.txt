This movie makes a great job of describing the situation of a person suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The subject is both compassionate and humorous. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS that it was hard for me to think she was acting alone. Kenneth Branagh, a superb actor, stands up to expectations as the strange artist who is wrong and is forced to provide a character company to Helena as part of his "community service," an alternative to prison time. Following the development of the relationship between these two is a treatment from the beginning to the end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not distract the fabulous performances. One comes in deep care for the two.
