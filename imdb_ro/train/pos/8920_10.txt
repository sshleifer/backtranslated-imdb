I did not know about Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew I was extremely scared of seeing this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but now I was ten years old). The first scene where Blob crawls with the farmer's walking stick and swallows his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But we have survived and suffered through every attack of our monsters. I felt such a horror when Steve and his girl barely took him out of the doctor's office (dumb dock) and even more when The Blob entered a cinema and devoured a large audience. . . so many, in fact, that they came from the front doors, too big to fit through one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in the growth potential, and when it caught the poor Steve on a dinner like a sieve, it seemed like a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that Blob was cold, it would be a modern description, but eventually better frozen than scared and the mental breakdown of young children. in the evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act courageously. He knew I had problems, and when I slept that night, I could not just feel the blob in the room, but when I bravely convinced myself to look down on the floor, I did not like the red hunger, sitting, waiting to I'm trying to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I did it. Of course, the Blob was not destroyed.
