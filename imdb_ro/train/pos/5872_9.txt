Who votes in these evaluations? "Jacknife" is a very well-played piece of work, with brilliantly noted actors, above them, especially Ed Harris and Robert DeNiro (do not remember Marlon Brando in the same movement of this man - see "Taxi Driver" to confirm this point ). It's a "mundane" movie because it does not have sex / action meaningless / nudity in it. This film refers to the complexity of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst to the end is tortuous. The part in which a young man orders a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and movies exploit tragic situations and how realists need to feel the need to see a young sporty young man. While we're on this theme, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest movies of all time, from one of the greatest directors, with the greatest film actor of all time, with the most frightening psychotic gangster ever, guarantees only a little above average? COME ON!!!!!
