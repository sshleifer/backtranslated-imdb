My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real story line of the first vampires of the carpenter John, but I do not care that I loved it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. He really annoyed me thinking he was the person you'd never thought he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were a few bad things about this movie. Just like the story line, there should have been more at film.there should have been a continuation of the movie that followed the story line of the film and should have kept the same main characters in all three films with vampires. I loved the clothes that people wore and the settings they had chosen in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was and not new Mexico. with clay houses and old-fashioned churches. I was a bit confused with the vampires and how they could go to the churches, but it was cool as they did not follow the Dracula vampire rules.
