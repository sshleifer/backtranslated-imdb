A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see their work on the move. As Goldsworthy builds his pieces, he develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspires and affects work. Although, I was happy that the film covered most Goldsworthy tracks (no snowball), I felt it was a bit long. Movie makers have done a great job of bringing Goldsworthy's life and created a wonderful movie that was a joy to watch.
