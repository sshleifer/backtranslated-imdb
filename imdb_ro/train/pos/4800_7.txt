I entered The Straight Story waiting for a sad / happy drama with a nice direction and good action. I got this. What we did not expect was an allegory for the attempts of human existence. Let Lynch take a simple story about a 300-mile journey on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. If you have not noticed, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people who meet Alvin, the land he leads, the reactions he gives to people, the type of discussions he has (one of the first being about pregnancy and children , one of which is outside a cemetery). The last road he leads is especially haunted in this context as he narrows, and his fear and nervousness rises. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the miraculous revival of his engine linked to a life after death, in which he reaches the desired meeting. I only hope that some of those who have marked this a sappy slow melody takes time to look with more holistic attention.
