The man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing's studies have done so well in the 1940s and 1950s. That plot is pursued by a man who invented a cloth that does not dirty or break. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the textiles world. However, things are not that simple, because the canvas will threaten the lifestyle of many people, including cloth manufacturers, the grinding mill, and even an old lady who makes it washed every week. Man in a white suit is a film about scientific progress and how it does not always help; as the old man once said in the film, "Why Can Scientists Lose Things Lonely?" Like a lot of Ealing comedies, he calls Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in an earthly and credible way. He is creepy in this film and he captures only the right atmosphere for his character; a smart and ambitious scientist, but a little naive. Together with Guinness, the white-haired man also includes Joan Greenwood, the deep actress who played with Guinness in the divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in Batman's films. The act in the movie is not always great, but it's always decent and matches the movie. The man in white suit is a smart, challenging and thoughtful comedy, with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious and does not always work, but the movie is not a movie that causes laughter, so it's forgiving. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of movies.
