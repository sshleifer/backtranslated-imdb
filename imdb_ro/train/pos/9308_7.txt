If you're accustomed to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Common Suspect I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all of the actors in this film offer very good performances. If you have about eleven dollars (which is close to nine quid), I say the online order, or you can rent it from your favorite movie rental place. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you like gangster movies or not. Mad Dog Time / Happy Trigger is one of those movies you never look at, and you will always and always look. You will talk about it so much that your friends will be asked to borrow it.
