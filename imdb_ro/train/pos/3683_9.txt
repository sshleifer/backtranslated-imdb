18 directors had the same task: telling stories about love set in Paris. Of course, some of them proved better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - in addition, would not it be boring if everyone has the same vision of love? Here's how I classify the segments (which might change in a second view): 1. "Quartier Latin" by Gérard Depardieu One of the greatest French actors has ever directed my segment preferring, always presenting stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Cute and delightful. 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, amazingly visual (thanks to the director "The Triplets of Belleville") the story of a boy whose parents are my mums; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious 4. "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También "," The Children of Men "), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "The 14th Arrondissement", the wonderful aspect of Alexander Payne's life ("Choice," About "Schmidt") is here, feat. actress of the undervalued character Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a middle-aged lonely American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's furious style (Run Lola Run) works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) falls in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", de Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a strange surprise by Alexander Payne ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple story but moving from talented Brazilian directors, featuring Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story feat. Maggie Gyllenhaal, always fantastic; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", de Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; 15. "Bastille", by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cămara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre" by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy," by Christopher Doyle, Barbet Schroeder (best known as "Barfly", "Reverse of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). We could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly dull), but none of them is very bad. On the whole, they give "Paris, Je t'Aime" a 8.5 / 10 and I recommend it for what it is: a wonderful mosaic of love and other things between them.
