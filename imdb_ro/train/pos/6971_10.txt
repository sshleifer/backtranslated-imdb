Of course, the "Sci-Fi" fan of the Battle Star Gallactica will hate that. This makes me happy. I do not like SF Sci-Fi shows, especially Galactica Battle-Star and that's why I like this show. The creators of the show had a lot of heat to do this (unconventional science - the same) and it is worth it. I read Wiki that they want to appeal to everyone, including women and not just celebrities. This is probably the most promising show from Lost. It has the most interesting, clever, and deeper scenario of a show in a while and is truly unique. What I like most about the show is that he plays a kind of great anime! From young adolescents running around the firearm to an extremely well balanced and complex script, the robots remind me of something that came from Japan, except for a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
