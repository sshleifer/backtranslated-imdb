The sequence of the title presents the credits written on a pavement watered by the rain, as people guided it; music is provided by someone whistling "Street Scene" from Alfred Newman. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But it's pretty vicious for a good guy. After several complaints about his harsh people, his boss, Insp. Nicolae Foley (Robert F. Simon) discourages him. Foley tells him he's a good man, but he has to make his head straight and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got a promotion. Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a splendidly thin performance) has an illegal dice game and was looking to make a sucker (Harry Von Zell), which was brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She thinks too late that her husband uses her as bait, and Paine hits her when she refuses to play. Crash Morrison intervenes, but Paine hits him cold. This seems to be the worst, but later it seems the guy died; and Paine seems guilty. But that's not Paine's story. Soon, Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before losing temper again and committing a terrible act he was trying to cover up. Morgan's father, a spinning taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take the rap for that. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalise. Otto Preminger directs a scenario credited to Ben Hecht and three of the Cry Cry novel by William L. Stuart. This is a solid noir movie with excellent performance and with all the shadowy photography and cloudy morality we expect from this genre. It keeps to the brightly lit end, which looks like something the studio had filmed for ease of censorship. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and with Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will enjoy this, but you can not miss this.
