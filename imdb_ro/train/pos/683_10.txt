I like the Ghost stories. Story of ghostly ghost of the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I've seen many of them. Because the special efx has more adhesion to today's movies, sometimes to find a real jewel, you have to turn the clock back when writers and directors have had to use their heads to create ghost stories. Now, this rare episode, for the TV series Ghost Story called "The New House," was one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but nothing since then, even compared to her. With all the remake of Hollywood, some should do it "as it is," with no more efux than the original. This episode was down, even creepy as hell. I'm lucky to finally find it on DVD today and very rarely and hard to find. The only other two ghostly stories that came close were the ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in The Changling. I want someone to make more ghost stories like this.
