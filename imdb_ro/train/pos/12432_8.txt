I was expecting this to be the same kind of school as the previous Modesty Blaise, which is why I left him so uncomfortable for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Far from being a succession of army battles and cars / boats, it was an almost intimate analysis of how a cute girl gets to be as hard as nails without overestimating or over-rationalizing anything. It is likely that the budget constraints helped with this: less time and effort was spent to find increasingly stupid ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was devoted to filming that is worth watching. Hell, the biggest fight with weapons is on the screen - and the scene in which it sounds is the better for the background noise that adds to the suspense - who wins? Who dies? Alexandra Staden may not be as wonderful as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that is necessary to do the work of character - and the shape of her face, her hair and her high body and thin could have been lifted directly from comic graphics. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a bad guy by Blaise because he made the character interesting and enjoyable to look - even pleasant (and I doubt I would consider many brutal psychopaths like friends to drink). I can not think of any of Hollywood's "former waiters" who could have relinquished their role. Fortunately, bad Blaise always die, in the end (there is no spoiler there!) A very good thing, because all the girls who would have spent time on such a disgustingly beautiful and interesting piece of piece can now be content with pragmatism for us, ordinary, Joes.
