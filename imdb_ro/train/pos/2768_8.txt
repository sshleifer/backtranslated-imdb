In addition to Susan Hayward's wood delivery alongside this film, it was as good as any biblical film made. Henry King deals with this film with respect for an epic in all small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. Alfred Newman's noise score, with his third agitated psalm, is unforgettable even after these years. The scene with Goliath is a little on the hokey side, but not everything that has been done bad for the era in which this movie was made. This goes well with the smaller biblical epics of the day, Rut's Song and Esther and the King. It's worth watching, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is rounded by James Robertson Justice, all right, like Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first wife.
