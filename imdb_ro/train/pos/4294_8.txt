It was not a dry eye among the public yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema after seeing this gem of a movie in a house sold at this year's Hamburg film festival. And the shedding of the tears was all laughter. This movie was hilarious, there is no other way to say this. It was not a bit boring in her, I laughed even through her and me all the other of us three hundred French-lovers. Alain Chabat was absolutely wonderful. A big clown, if necessary, and seriously if the situation does. Performance was, of course, completely above the top, but that was exactly the story and what made it work so well. So great was Charlotte Gainsbourg, who likes to see a lot, and my mom was also a very strong performance. The sisters could have been somewhat more detailed in written characters, but besides, there is nothing to stir up. I had a great afternoon seeing this movie while Hamburg drowned out of the rain and I would like such films in France to get a regular release in Germany. But the distributors in this country do not seem to understand that the French do good movies. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because the movie I need at home to watch multiple times!
