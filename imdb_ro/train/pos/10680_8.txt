As is almost always the case, when the UK comes with a sit-com show or a fun and / or successful concert, Yanks will come and take shape and produce their own inferior version. Man About the House is of course not an exception to this rule. The version of Yanks (Third Company) was inconceivable, like "braindead", which seems to flow forever. A first example of quality over (non-existent quality). On the other hand, the original is a precious stone that had the meaning (like Fawlty Towers) to pull the connector at the right time (as opposed to the 637 episodes of "hilarity" that Three Company ). Jo was cute, it was a brilliant chemistry between Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan did everything so easy, the scenarios, while not exactly the Oscar Wilde standard, were constantly funny, and Chrissy was the most beautiful woman who walked to this planet because the Dead Sea felt just bad. Nuff said.
