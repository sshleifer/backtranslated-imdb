There have not been many films about Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) airplane, but this is one of them and it's good. Just a fun movie to watch. Most of the film takes place at NAS Lakehurst's Navy Blimp (starring NAS Tustin). Wallace Beery performs a Munchausen-like troop pilot, Ned Trumpet, an enlightened pilot whose tall stories have become so frequent that no one truly believes in him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie, when events begin to prove that most of the stranger stories are actually true. Set during the Second World War, the main plotting centers around the Trumpet bumble wooing a local widow only end up having a father-son relationship with the son of the wounded widow, Jess. I told him he would never go without the crutches by the doctors, the trumpet boss pulls some strings and a Navy flight surgeon helps restore the sick leg. Jess continues to join the Navy to become a flight officer, flying back to Lakehurst and confronting a full set of challenges. A very well made film, though not without a Hollywood dialogue past the technical advisers, and apparently incapable of Beery to go in step. Otherwise, this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and offers a rare look at Lavy's Lavy operations. The cash recording scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future interest, Cathy's love, is an absolute shot.
