I've seen some movies about eating disorders, but it was definitely the most favorite. The problem with the others was that people with end-of-food disorders just automatically automatically or accept that they need help, and that is. this movie I thought was the more realistic cause in this one Lexi main character not just getting better. She gets better and then has a downside. I think this film shows more than others that we have seen that improvement is not just happening, it's hard work and time, it's a long way to recovery. I think this movie looks very good. There should be more movies like this.
