I could write a comment large enough for any of the characters in Gundam Wing, each of which could lead the series with internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 wonderful views that lead us through 49 gold episodes of anime happiness. It contains dialogue that you can rotate in your head for months ... years, then go back and derive a new meaning from, a masterpiece written in the script (even if it has the typical anime feature of the fact that there is a discrepancy between subtitles and English dub). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think of your own points of view. Relationships between cold men and women who love women are an autonomous aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relna, and Milliardo and Noin is a joy to follow. Apparent male rejection is sustained by an inner disorder that makes love (a word never mentioned in series) of the women needed for them in their wild soldiers' environment. Women look for aspects of men that we rarely see, which makes the men of the world more enigmatic. It takes Heero all 49 episodes to show some care, but he gets there, and when he does, it's a big pay. <br /> <br /> And then there is the giant robot fight. Fun to watch wonderful sequences as good as any Hollywood epic battle scene. Anyway, a worse person would see the giant robot fighting like a cartoon for kids, as it became clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends but I'm wrong. Many of the Gundam Wing giant robot battles contain a serious dose of pathos, usually in the case of young rebels fighting for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their faith overcome. The constant shifts in tone and accent through each episode make Gundam Wing impossible to boring, is an exciting, thought-provoking study of the potential of the mind and the human body.
