I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me since then. A sequence is especially in the mind and can only be done by a great director, as Michael Cacoyanis is undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history and a strong army and fleet are on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilegy brought the sea, threatening the great expedition to Troy. They say they have to sacrifice Apollo's daughter Iphigenia to win the winds for thousands of ships. He resists initially but returns and tricks his wife Clytemenstra to bring her daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all the warriors, Achilles. Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, to find out about sacrifice and anger toward the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name was used in this fraudulent, dishonorable way. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. Shot: The camera circles two youngsters, without looking directly at each other. They want the fate and the weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and lust for war. Suddenly, they look at each other and for a moment we feel both their strength and their beauty, and the blurred irony - except the room - that at another time, in another place, it would he could love and marry. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that only lasts for a moment. What direction! What room! What a story!
