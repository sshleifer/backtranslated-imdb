This film is almost generative for some of us who were born in the early postwar years (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and you enjoyed spending the afternoon of Saturday at your home in Neighbor neighborhood) you almost saw it. And remembering that he saw he was probably with you. Style is the thing of a short and glorious moment, in our day of growth. <br /> <br /> It had a modern, space-age story for the audience of its time. The set was any city with a supermarket and a cinema that would be packed for a midnight show on Friday. She has hot rods and young rebels, but in the "why we can not let ourselves have fun", rather than on the troubled, rebellious, histrionic road, without being cause. All of our characters were identifiable - adolescents, parents, old man, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy and even the police - we were sympathetic. We could refer to them all <br /> <br /> He had a singular scary monster. The first victim is heard moaning "it hurts ... it hurts" and I was convinced and scared. The danger is constantly increasing throughout the story. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, a fabulous lead in McQueen, and moments of humor, both intentional and not. She even had a sad part to make it more sensible to feel as if we were crying. I saw her in the 9-year-old summer, double-billed with "I married a monster from outer space" and was so excited about the experience of this doubled feature that I returned a few times before I left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved.
