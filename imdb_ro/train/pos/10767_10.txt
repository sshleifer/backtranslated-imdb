Of course I should give this movie 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the main screenwriter of the "Once in a Murder" scenario. Rodolfo Sonego has written scripts for over 50 years living in Italy. He was a great storyteller and someone suggested he put his stories in writing. That's what Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check his biography, you can see the number of films made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to check out the locations for "A Girl in Australia," and created a wonderful movie about a procurred bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his movies. I recently found a copy of this movie on DVD. THAT'S GREAT
