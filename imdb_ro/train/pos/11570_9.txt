Elmer Fudd laughs as he sits down in his easy chair and reads his book of comics, his dog surrounded nearby, sleeping in front of the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a purse comes to hunt. (Pula is dressed in a large sombrero farmer suit and wears a purse called "A. Flea" on her.) He pulls out his telescope and shows the dog. (We see a big blow of the dog's ass and flea whistle in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" Then he sings, "There's food at the corner, corner food!") It sets the story this cute-but-obnoxious flea that afflicts the poor dog. Mut is hilarious because it reacts to fleas. <br /> <br /> His huge teeth drawings, which cling to the squirrel near the squirrel, are intelligent, and the dog's dialogue made me laugh aloud a few times. This could be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! Pooch poor, under the threat of taking a bath, not to react when the bad flea causes pain. It's almost painful to watch fleas use pickaxes, jackhammers and the like. Put the cock behind the dog. It's brutal!
