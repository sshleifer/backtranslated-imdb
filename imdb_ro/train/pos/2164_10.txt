He watched this night last night and was crowned with the storyless story, the excellent character's evolution, and the good vibe of the karmic that emanates from acting and the film as a whole. Without much of the plot, it starts with an ordinary joe who changes every day the office job, which is inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and assorted characters he meets in search of being smooth on the dance floor, learns lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what dance in Japan is sociologically symbolizing, so it's not as easy to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the US <br /> <br /> The film is harmless; you will laugh out loud at some of the gangs of sight. However, it is also worthy in a way that is hard to describe. All the characters of the film are taken seriously, as they are, and none is diminished because of their "imperfections". I thought I'd take classes of social dances with some friends. So it happened that a friend lent me the video to learn to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think because I'm in love now to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (small children may not, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine care you see shown in it again and again. they would make a remake of We Dance is a mystery, because it is perfect as it is.
