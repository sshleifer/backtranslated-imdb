I could not keep my tears when I looked at this beautiful documentary. It was heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. I recommend this document to anyone looking for something that will make them think about what they do with their own lives. Or simply something that will make you think. See how John lives in the last two months of his life. You will follow when going through his days with a positive attitude. At some point, you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual. Begin to understand that he has something to learn all about. His life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and you will discover that life is much easier to live if you take it one day.
