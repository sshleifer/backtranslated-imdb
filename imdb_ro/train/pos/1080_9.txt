The "comedy" movie nowadays is generally 100 minutes of humor to the toilet, unpleasant language and blows. Modern comedies address the smallest common denominator, the unusual and slow brain of the brain. Of course, an occasional good comedy will come, but it is becoming rarer. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings The Houses of His Dream House" shows what was capable of Hollywood in the 1940s and it's just funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows their story, from home hunting trips, the wasting construction of the house to the finished house - with the "zuzzuzzuzz water conditioner". Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is especially funny as she supervises the house's cost of getting out of control). However, the film is stolen by Blandings' wise lawyer, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Managing himself to steal every scene he is in, Douglas is hilariously underestimated while he pursues the escape from the Blandings from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the architect of Blandings and Harry Shannon, as well as the old water conductor, are wonderful. I have watched this movie many times and always make me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need a lift, whether you build a house or not.
