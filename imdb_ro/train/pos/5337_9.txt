It can be the remake of 1987, after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung said. Mabel uses rock music as a means in this film to express her personal attitude towards life, where love, desire and frustration result in a crucial role. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the deep feeling, and yet it's not too bad to use it because the rocket musicians' life is wider than usual. The director focuses on the representation of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life, rather than rock music. The love of father and son, lovers and friends is delicate and gifted through fine performance. Mabel is not trying to embellish rock musicians as artists, but instead tries to reproduce real life on screen, making enormous years of work on this project and collecting information in Beijing's underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably given the best performance in all his films made so far. Her inborn depression and reluctance perfectly match the blue state of the film.
