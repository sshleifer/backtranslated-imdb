In the fifties, the age restrictions for Brazilian movies were the following: without restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Typically, Westerners were allowed for ten years when they had a little more violence at 14, but it was very rare to see a restricted vest for less than 18 years. Winchester 73 was one of these, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from the media. The hero, James Stewart, is fighting his own brother, who has killed his father. He sought revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the good one. Anthony Mann tried variations of this character in the following films he made with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the lady of leadership, was not virtuous at all, and she continued to follow the man who was left with the rifle. Dan Durya as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the movie, which always follows the man who remains with the rifle, is one of the most suitable for a vest. It was supposed to be done in a Fritz Lang movie that did not go through. When he was offered to Mann, he made a starting point from scratch and not taking anything ready for Lang. With Winchester, Mann has created a different concept of the West, but has retained all its traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression she made to those who saw her when it was originally launched.
