I saw this movie on TV and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was an elegant movie and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and, of course, McComb. At that moment I was delighted to watch this movie and since then I'm trying the VCD of this movie but I can not find it. The huge African Lion makes its appearance in his film and we will be simply spooked by the size of these animals and their grace. All audiences can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving McComb force parenting guidance for this movie. This is a pleasant holiday film for one and all.
