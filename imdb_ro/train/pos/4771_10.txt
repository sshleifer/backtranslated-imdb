Zenith of two shining pitches. David Lynch, better known for less accessible materials, realizes a delicate and refined story around the least precious premise. A man travels to see his estranged brother. With no other means of transport, his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, offers amazingly layered and nuanced performance in the lead role. Too beautiful in its small stuff, Straight Story is a classical cinematic experience that should not be missed. Sissy Spacek is remarkable as Farnsworth's daughter, a middle-aged woman who lives with the loss of her children.
