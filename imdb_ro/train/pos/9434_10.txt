I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago, and I did not pay full attention, maybe I even disappeared the first half of the year so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and outdated. I decided to review her last night to see if I missed the first time. Of course I did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and has clearly had a significant influence on today's films and will probably be forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds perform their career and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and fear for a long time after watching it, it's really terrible. Oh, and I mentioned that the theme song is great, too? Well, it is, and this movie should be seen by film fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for this experience. Do not expect a picnic.
