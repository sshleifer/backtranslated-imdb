This is a movie that has many things that only the Japanese can understand. Well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbols. I think he tried to send a message like this, but that was wasted to me. What I felt was that it was basically a mediocre film with cute special effects. A kid becomes "the other" and ultimately has almost no relevance for a yokai war that does not make any sense anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the washing of azomes and the one that looked like a big tongued umbrella (Rihanna ate your heart!) I could not really discern the plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: beautiful visuals, baby crying a lot, the princess of the river is terribly cute and the rest is stupid.
