Actually, this is one of those movies you should give 7.5. The fact is; as already said, is a great fun. Wonderful atmosphere. Askey is really seen as the top but it is a wonderful vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will hay. If you like movies and old trains of dark houses, then this is certainly for you. Very strange is the type of movie you will want to see again and again. It is friendly and charming in a strange way, with all the nostalgic references that made a great warfare. The "strange" band of characters is simply playing with each other, as they do in many other British war movies. It would have been great to have seen this film if it had been recorded by the studios in Ealing. A pity that the 1931 original did not survive intact
