Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well-done by everyone. Even a few moments of "laugh-out-tough" mixed with some pretty serious remarks about fidelity, age bias, and aging parents / Alzheimer's problems. Even the guitar music added to the story, too. While I was a fan of Mrs. Annis from 'Lillie' (in the '70s) and Kitchen Kitchen from' The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I recently discovered Mr. Verde ("I and Mrs Jones "," Touching Evil ", etc.), making me wonder - why have not I ever seen it before," Reckless "?! Of course, more than a "chicken shot" than a man he will sit for, is perfect for lazy watching the rainy afternoon.
