A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty, but is seen as a threat to the survival of different industries. In this delightful comedy of Ealing Studios, Guinness is wonderful as a gentle but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays the interest of love; Parker is her father harassed. Thesiger is funny as a patriarch of the fabric industry. While telling an interesting story, the film raises some interesting questions about science, economics and politics. It's really directed by Mackendrick, who will continue to make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success", later in the 1950s.
