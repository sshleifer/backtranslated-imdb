I just watched tonight and forgot how much I like this movie. It's great fun and lets you feel that everything is right with the world. I like Mozart's alusions along the opening with "Einstein," starring Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star on the violin while he murmured Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during Ed Walters' IQ testing. I like that a woman is portrayed as smart and encouraged to have a career, a particularly unique situation for the 1950s, when this film is set. (I myself was a teacher, but I stayed home to raise my children, so please do not think I'm a firm woman.) It's great how a man who is "just a fat monkey" is finally seen as important and dignified as Catherine's fianc√©, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is much more defined - without labels. There are so many small gags and gaskets that are close, if not the waste in it looks and listens carefully. <br /> <br /> I get a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters is about to speak at the symposium, there are three instruments (a lecturer, a leader, etc.) that are on the right side of the chalk. In the next camera shot, not only 2. our video credits, displays the character Tony Shalhoub as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he is featured in the film and is listed here at IMDB. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie. It can be a piece of fluff in some estimates, but it has a lot more substance than it gives credit for many. Not only that, which is a great distribution here. Watch and enjoy!
