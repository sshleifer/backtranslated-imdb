Jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short show some of the best jazz people just do their things. It's like watching a musical video without a muffin today. Jazz men give us extra treatment in the person of Marie Bryant, who plays a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I've never heard him sing before, Bryant sounds remarkable like Billie Holliday. This is a compliment people. Their instrumental instrument is top also. With the black cinema of his time fed a lot of white stereotypes, this film must be watched and cherished. There are no high production values, just a lot of good music.
