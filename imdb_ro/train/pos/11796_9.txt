Just because it is based on the most infamous mass, the suicide incident of the modern age would have been enough to give this attention to a television movie made in 1980. But the fact is that it is a wonderful recreation of Rev. life. Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire and then encouraged them to disintegrate in a relentless worship in which an assistant and an entourage were assassinated and 917 followers of the culture committed suicide by consuming Kool-Aid with cyanide. Very nice but frightening, unlike CULT OF THE DAMNED, GYYANA TRAGEDY has an exceptional casting, including Ned Beatty (like Rep Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But Powers Boothe (in his first important role) is truly remarkable as Jim Jones. He actually becomes man, and his performance is riveting and cooling. So, no wonder that this movie still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
