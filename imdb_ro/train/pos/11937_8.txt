That was definitely the case with Angels in Outfield. It was on TV last night and I think I have not seen the movie ever since high school in high school and now I'm in the fourth year of my college. Although the film has many flaws, it is so so exciting that you can not help sitting down, watching and enjoying yourself. It's also hilarious. Danny Glover's dancing is just so high that you can not help but laugh loudly at him for the longest time. It adds to the movie and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. Actually, you feel for the characters in the movie, even if the development is not the best. I need to see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
