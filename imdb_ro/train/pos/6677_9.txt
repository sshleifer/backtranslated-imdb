A movie about Wannabee's thoughts, who were never less than the heroes, making him against all chances. Where I heard this before. But when the fuck are Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is not your conventional story to riches the story. A classic interpretation of Eddie Izzard as Tony P. One of Disco's boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows that real thinking has entered the casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear at first glance a strange choice for the amazing captain role turns out on the spot on. Watch this movie if you are sick of comic-gone - film stereotypes. Why could not your anger be a super power?
