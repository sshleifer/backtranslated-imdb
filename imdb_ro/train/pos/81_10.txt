I looked at the McCoys meeting and I was glad to see Richard Crenna, Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now was great, because I have always seen the big show, so when the television said it would be a reunion it was so excited !!!! The only thing I did not realize is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I got to my computer and tried to find out about it and found this site, and if there's someone to tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I'd be grateful The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman was that he should have been born in 1946. This show was valuable and moral, and each show gave a lesson to learn. All cast was faithful the only thing better than finding out they would be to meet them So because this is impossible if there is anyone who can help thank you Glenda
