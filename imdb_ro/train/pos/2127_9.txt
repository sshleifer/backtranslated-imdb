Calling on this romantic comedy is accurate, but it is currently misleading. The genre worsened from sadness in clichés, too focused on making the main couple gather with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formidable and excessively predictable. The store around the corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a recognized Middle Eastern / East-East atmosphere and has a strong distribution apart from nominal leadership (also powerful); I avoid using the words "supporting distribution," for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role in the film, and his story is just as important, if not more important than romanticism. The 1998 movie You received the borrowed Mail the "anonymous pen-pal" idea of ​​this movie and was therefore billed as a remake. This is not fair and, in fact, unfair to the new movie - shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that's all.
