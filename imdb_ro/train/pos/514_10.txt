Of course, one of the best British movies ever made, if not one of the best movies ever made anywhere. Scripture, cinema, direction, and acting in a class on their own. This movie works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Has never been shown on TV? Why is it hidden when presented regularly at the London National Theater for packed houses?
