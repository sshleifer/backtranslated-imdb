Probably one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before seeing this, I suggest you see South Park one of the most fun cartoons you've ever created. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. Smart genius race. If you do not think it's funny, then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
