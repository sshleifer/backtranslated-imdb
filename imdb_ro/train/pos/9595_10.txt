At the beginning of this film, one commentator says he has been told he has two blows against him: he is black and male. But besides, he has a third strike: he's gay. "You will have to be stronger than you imagined," he said. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about black homosexuals and Hispanic men who are transsexual or transsexual. The miracle of "Paris is burned" is the fact that director Jennie Livingston takes on a subject that could easily become a strange show and allows his people to be human. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so impossible to achieve, it's tragic. Many people are serious about denial; this is not a movie for everyone. There are photos in this nude transsexual movie. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie you will realize that "Paris burns" is not about men wearing women's clothes but about a group of people who are usually marginalized and disadvantaged by society in general and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives. I've seen this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things: it's a commentary on materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about the rich and the poor, about the media and about what celebrate, about fame and adoration. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane and one of the most experienced movies I've ever seen.
