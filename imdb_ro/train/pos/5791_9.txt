This must be one of the most favorite episodes in the Twilight Zone, primarily to illustrate two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. Spider web shops and streets loaded with stones are particularly frightening, the Twilight area does its best. While the parable can be a little bit heavy with the dramatic standards today, it is excellent - using the setting to make a relevant statement for human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is not oversized. The entire drama is based exclusively on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (May both of them rest in peace). A real classic.
