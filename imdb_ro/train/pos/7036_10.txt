It has to be one of the best political satiations we have seen so far, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the actors who support them. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and very unexpectedly twisted at the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. On the whole I give this film a big finger. It is extremely critical of the US military intervention in the Middle East and as such may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate dark humor and the third. Indeed, in places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was clear between amusing and tragic.
