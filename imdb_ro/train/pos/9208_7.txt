"The Shooter" was another type of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although commonly associated with martial arts action, this film, because it was a Western, allowed him to show that he is a much more capable actor than allowed some story lines. the problem, of course, is that the film does not allow any solid development of the character. Fleshing in is really left to the viewer. We can only guess the sadness that made Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer that he is a killer, think that a small town, terrified by a local bully, hails as a hero who can free herself from her misery.
