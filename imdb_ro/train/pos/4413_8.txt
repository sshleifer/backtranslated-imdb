Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Dominican Republic. To release the photo, change the original name to Cuba Libre. Cutting the director lasted three and a half hours. It was released at the Bangkok festival in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael Garc√≠a Bernal (the first was Amores Perros) and the first by Juan Gerard as director. In the poster, the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear. Diana plays grandmother and Cecilia's mother. They are great actresses and they keep the story together with Diana. Check it out for other things, you'll be surprised.
