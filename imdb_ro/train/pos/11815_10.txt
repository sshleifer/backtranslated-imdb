At the time I write this I see from over 15,000 votes has a rating of 5.8. Something is wrong with that image. Personally, I give myself a 10th. I can see a 7th to the smallest or a possible 8 if it was rated by those who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on a comic book hero. This movie won more than a part of the awards. He has won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins & 26 nominations .... right there says it's better than a 5.8. Some of the best actors from some very good actors, some special special effects and, in my opinion, will, if not already, be a classic for the coming years. If you're looking for pure fun, make sure you check Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch multiple times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
