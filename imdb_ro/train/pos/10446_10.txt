I watched this movie 10 years ago. and watched it on average once a year since then. is the type of film that is timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversations are so personal. is also one of the few movies that captures you from the first frame to the credit, despite the fact that there are indeed only two characters (very involved). this is largely due to the commitment of Hawke and Delpy, which makes us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie I've seen that mentioned real television, and now the phenomenon is shaken! I like how this movie surrounds the audience in its space and makes you think, no matter how jaded you are, that you are one of those characters. they also made me want to go by train around Europe! I did not meet anyone who could not handle this movie. maybe I'm talking about myself, my friends or just about the pure genius of this movie.
