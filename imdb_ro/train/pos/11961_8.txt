I thought it was a great way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching an open-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is wizarding and the characters are pleasant (even the bread well suspected of serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize that it is not Match Point 2: Addiction Risk, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style that many of us loved. That was the most I've laughed at Woody's comedy for years (I dare say a decade?). While I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, in this case, she managed to strengthen her "sexy" image and jumped into a middle-aged but scared young woman. This can not be the crown jewelery in his career, but it was more than "Devil Wears Prada" and more exciting than "Superman," an extraordinary comedy to meet with friends.
