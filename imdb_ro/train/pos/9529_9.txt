This is one of the best movies in 2002. Maybe it's not the best movie, but it looks best, it has an excellent acting and it's perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with "American Beauty". She tells of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael Rooney (Paul Newman) thinks things will be fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), leaves his father as well as Michael, leading to the death of Michael's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends Harlem Maguire (Jude Law) to finish his job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization, he's trying to win some friends who can help, including Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) mob boss. In a way, "Road to Perdition" is a standard gangster movie but it's so good you almost can not see it. This film is good in his production design, direction of art, sound, music and especially in his cinema. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense, although the result is quite certain. That Hoechlin is not an annoying child, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course. Based on a comic, this movie is much better than you would expect, and although it has defects, it belongs to better genre films. Sometimes there are events that you realize you've seen so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult Hanks and child Hoechlin help in this area. See this movie, which sometimes looks familiar, but it's completely new in many areas.
