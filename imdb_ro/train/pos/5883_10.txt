I looked, enthralled and fascinated by the vocal and physical acts. The roles that each character has interpreted have been accomplished with excellence. The lyrics, the words, every gesture, the sunrise told me everything. The film spoke to me. It illuminates me for a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. We have also been held in unbelief, through sacrifices and human dignity being portrayed. Power without grace is dementia and without feelings. To have power at the price of mankind is so incredible. This movie made me so afraid for people who are no longer in this world. And, sadly, I think about them. I like this movie for conversations and face expressions for all this. May this movie be blessed.
