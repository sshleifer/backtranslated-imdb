I could not have been more excited; Only eight years in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was going to happen. At that time, my only Star Wars experience was some Star Wars HBO shows. I have not even seen Empire Strikes Back yet. And boy, he gave that day for my eyes more critical. Jabba. Rebel Maritime King. King. A green light with chains! Wow! Since that magical day, I've probably seen this movie hundreds of times. I can not even make a correct estimate at this point. With those multiple views, I noticed, of course, that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its flaws. Of course, in the context of a Star Wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "moves". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983 I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.
