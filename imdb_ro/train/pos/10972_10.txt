I have seen this only recently, but I have been aware of it for a few years and have always been intrigued by its title. Now belongs to one of my favorite movies. It's hard to describe the incredible subject that Maysles has discovered, but everything in it works great. It has so many memorable pictures and moments in which you feel that you are violating a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it. It is as if the filmmakers cast a audience spell and attracted us into the weird world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I woke up wishing to be far from everything, my cooked corn on my thigh at my bedside table. It has an air of sorrow that penetrates all the way. A great fall for this family once credible. The money went away, but their air and grace remained as well as their beauty. They drew me from the first frame and long after the movie ended, I woke up wondering about their fate. I wonder if I walked along East Hampton Beach, I could hear Old Edie's voice at night and see Little Edie's silhouette dancing in the window behind the thick ramp. Unforgettable.
