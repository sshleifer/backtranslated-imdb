Before watching this movie I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last film Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong I had previously watched. As for sex scenes I was disappointed, I thought Dreamquest's sexual scenes would be great as Flashpoint sex scenes but I was disappointed. With the exception of Asian Carrera's sexual scene, any sexual scene in this movie does not make me feel great (you know what I mean). The Jenna Jameson Sea does not do that sort of sexual scenes about what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift Both of these wonderful girls disappoint me, but also in terms of sexual scenes. Although it is an adult film, but if we take aside the sex scenario factor, this movie is very good. When it comes to standards for adult movies, this film has certainly set standards for adult films. The story, the action, the direction, the sets, the makeup and other technical stuff of this movie are really wonderful. The actors in this movie have done a great job, all have done a great job. Dreamquest is certainly the high quality bar for adult movies.
