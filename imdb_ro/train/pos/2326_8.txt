Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister, Maureen (Emily Warfield), until they both fall in love with their neighbors' court (Jason London). But not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can prevent them and that their love for each other will never disappear. This was really a heartbreaking story about the first love. Probably the most painful story about the young love I've ever seen. All the acting is amazing, and Reese Witherspoon offers great performance in his first film. I would give the man a month 8.5 / 10
