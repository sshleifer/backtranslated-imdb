This movie surprised me when he started in a Cafe in Arizona and Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", "04, decides to have something to eat and gets very hot and upset over a very hot, sexy waitress While Rex leaves Cafe, he sees a State Trooper and asks, "Are you fast?" And then all hell breaks in more ways than one. "Nancy Allen (" Maggie Hewitt ")," Dressed to Kill "," 80, is a TV reporter and always looking for a newscast to broadcast. Maggie ends up in a hot tub and Rex comes to tell him he wants a Western-style show with the local policeman in town. This is a different movie, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who help this picture TOGETHER!
