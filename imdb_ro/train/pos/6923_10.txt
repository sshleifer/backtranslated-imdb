SPOILER CONTAINER Except for John Wayne, no other actor sat higher in the western saddle than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This gorgeous revenge story, centered around a Winchester kid, has only one weak spot I can think of: Will Geer's casting as a Wyatt Earp, very similar to UnEarp. The casting of the bad was good: Stephen McNally, like Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile in playing both good boys and bad guys) as a gun runner. Stewart and McNally's confrontation on the cliffs is great! I would have stored this West against all Western harvests made today. He would not have the chance!
