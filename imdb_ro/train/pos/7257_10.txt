The reason I say this is that I wrote the script and I know very little about it being made until I was asked to see the movie. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I heard about it. I just wrote a first draft, so I was obviously worried when I heard he was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if I might like to do another project. I also asked if I could see the original script because I lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do in these circumstances and I got my name. I had no idea what he could do to my scenario. Then I was invited to see the movie finished. I was so impressed that I asked very quickly to call my name back. It's a beautiful piece made of a first draft written in a hurry, I was expecting to be asked to do more work; maybe if I had it, it would not be so good. Would I like to see the original script again if someone knows where it is? I would also like to see the movie again, I just saw it in a small viewing theater in Soho.
