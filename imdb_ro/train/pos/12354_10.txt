A great movie to watch with stunning scenes and talented actors such as Misha Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get stuck on the screen and just breathe into the atmosphere of the movie waiting for the fate of the characters. This movie makes you leave your standard audience position, takes you, makes you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are brilliant; in particular the okiyas district is skillfully built. It's definitely not Akira Kurosawa, but it's got a lot from the master, especially the stylistic story telling us we're in a distinguished country of cinema that's pretty far away from hollywoodish flamboyance.
