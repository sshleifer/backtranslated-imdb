I've always been a fan of David Lynch and the film proved to critics that Lynch has talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the golden surreal that became known in the last decade. As much as the movie is G-rated, Lynch is pure in style, peace and tone. The film moves in a hypnotic rhythm and is full of scenes of genuine emotion and power. Cinematography is extraordinary, as expected from a Lynch movie, and the transition tuning sequences are breathtaking. It is also very refreshing to see a movie where the characters are friendly staff, skillfully folk and not motivated characters that are clearly labeled as either "good" or "bad". Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful as well as other distributors, especially Sissy Spacek in a charming performance as a mobster and Harry Dean Stanton or in a small role, but infinitely crucial. With this film, David Lynch proved critics that could make a strong cinematic motion, as in the '80s with "Blue Velvet" and "The Elephant Man". Critics seemed to lose confidence in the last decade after produced such films surreal like "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but with this film he showed that there is a method FWWM and LH it seems that critics have finally caught up with his recent film "Mulholland Drive", considering the big slogan he has received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. Straight Story is for me one of the most mysterious movies you've ever seen. It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the goodness of strangers. I would recommend a lot.
