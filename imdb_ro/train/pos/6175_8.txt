I saw this pilot when he was presented for the first time and I'm sure the countless "Spirit" fans hate him, because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., took the character in the direction of the "camp". But obviously, I never got to Batman, because I thought it was fun, in some of the same ways as that show. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner was hurt, he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and listened to the exact letter. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" What is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilant, though he does (though the kind of Batman television). Then there is the scene in which he tries to seduce villainess in letting him go kissing her, but she is not fooled, because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was an extraordinary example of "camp", which was also "understood" by both actor and actress.
