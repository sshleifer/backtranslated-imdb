The words of the daughter are poems: "I can not go another year, I have to get to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble fauna is moving ... he gave us a washing machine. That's the deal." - I'm spraying this. "..praccans and cats are getting a little dull for too long." ".. a small rat's nest, mouse hole, I'd better want." And there is wisdom in the mother's words: "... pleasure is mine." "This little book will keep me right as a dye." "You always have to do everything right." - Where the hell are you from? "... bring me my little radio, I have some professional music." - I'm your mother, do you remember me? The parent / daughter relationship is drawn into this magnificent movie. This is the movie of a mother's day.
