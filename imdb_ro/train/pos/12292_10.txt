I like this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... almost everything has already been told about the film, but there is a detail that I would like to cast into the light: there are no pictures of the real room, still standing du North (I have heard that it was demolished ...) was used for the film - the entire scene was rebuilt on the set, the main reason being that they could not stop traffic on the St Martin canal for a few weeks.
