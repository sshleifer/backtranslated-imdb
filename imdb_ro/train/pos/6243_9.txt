a movie about the cruelty of this world. I have found the release, for only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny bits. Some of the actors are extraordinary, for example, Maria Hofstätter. The director tried to describe life as realistically as possible, succeeding. Consistently, sexual scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a rough movie. Although I barely understood a sentence, I found the film's vision in the original language with a much more rewarding subtitle, because with the double half the great work of the actors is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to duplicate by a dabbler. My favorite movie
