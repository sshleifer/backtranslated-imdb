I liked the movie. I love the two families that cross the paths of history. The only question is if Sam is killed then as his family line continues? Is Zeroni's son, and Zero should be associated, but no mention of other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have I never mentioned any other children or wife before talking to him and falling in love with the teacher? Perhaps she had a baby before she became kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. I just loved her. The act was great. I do not know where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a woman at the end but making his character even more fun. The other "counselor" seemed worried about the children, but of course not so much. The poor director should have had a really strident childhood to be so bad when he grew up.
