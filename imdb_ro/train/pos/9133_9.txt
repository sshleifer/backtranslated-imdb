We were young to know too much about the prince, but in recent years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain's Novelty Tee and I thought I was cool, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know about. So one Saturday came on the wick and I decided to see her. I did not know what the movie would be before I saw it, but it was great when I found out. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but as a "child". All the shows where I was wonderful, but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki and I'd die for you. All the songs related to what happened in the movie, when his mother and father were always struggling with the song when pigeons screamed described what he felt. I also like how skillful the prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked when the prince and Appallonia met first in the club and stood behind her and then, once she came back, she disappeared! a great movie and now I can not find even one of those shirts:
