Fighting the sword was out of this world, spectacular spectacular fights without flying on a wire technique (to the end), which are today too frequent. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the climax of the movie. The characters in the assault on the bad guys' mansion were clich√©, but the movie is comfortable with him. A humorous injection of Woo. The plot with its twists and turns was unpredictable and interesting, and you could not tell who was good or bad or where the people on the side were. <br /> <br /> A good sense of suspense and well-planned surprises. The depth of the story is quite intense for a flying movie of its kind and touches you the way most kung-fu shootings do not do that.
