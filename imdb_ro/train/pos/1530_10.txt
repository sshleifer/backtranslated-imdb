Old Show People ???? I am 15 years old and I watched the 12-year-old show, recode it on my Sky + basket every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they did not cancel it, they did not even say goodbye . But what an adventure, all those episodes, I think I've seen them all and I can not think I did not like and enjoy myself. It's a shame that the BBC continues to change between Crime and Murder wrote. "I've never seen it or intend. However, the characters in "Diagnoses Murder" are so deep, and the chemistry among the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled the show ........
