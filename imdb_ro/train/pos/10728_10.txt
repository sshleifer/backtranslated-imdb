Fantastic film for space. a group of children accidentally climb into space and have to go down, but they certainly do. This would not be a family film if everyone died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the most important lady, to give a Golden Globe show, but unfortunately she and Lea Thompson have not won one. That's so bad. I can not tell you enough, this movie is so great, Lea Thompson, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is the safest. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated, and the space camp has been so underestimated. It should be reversed around 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. I do not know math
