I have to say that I did not have the slightest idea to sit down and watch this movie. I think it was the fact that there was nothing better to do between the class. But because a television movie caught my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I was not really a big fan of her before this movie. Of course I liked Twister and as well as it happens. But something about this movie really made me. Now I would see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with big signs from ... me. Give her a chance, you will not disappoint.
