Often only after years, we can look back and see those stars that are really stars. Just as the French film critic, whose name I am missing, said, "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, only Louise Brooks"; and there is, thank heaven! Louise Brooks! This is the third of his European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film to be one, if not the first, French speaker, to follow a script written by renowned Ren√© Clair, which seems to have been done by Georg Pabst and to incorporate Edith Piaf's voice before she is well known! So much talent works in a movie, how can not it be a masterpiece ?! And that's the movie. It's a shame Louise Brooks was neglected by Hollywood when she returned to the United States - so many talented people so arrogant along the way! In the film, in addition to getting to watch Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris like. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice. I never get tired of this movie!
