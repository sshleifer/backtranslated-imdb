Wow was a great Italian film "ZOMBIE" by two great directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno MATTIE ("HELL OF THE DEAD DEAD") Lucio started this film and was sick so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly well than I expected to appear so if you saw "HELL OF THE DEAD LIVING" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and you liked both or one of the themes then this is a movie you need to watch out for a great makeup wizard "ZOMBIE" that has a wonderful look "ZOMBIES" has a funny flight head "ZOMBIE" and birds "ZOMBIE" that spits acid to you and turns you in a "ZOMBIE" People), but they are mainly just the big "ZOMBIES" toxic, as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE DEAD LIVING". So if you like the Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or the movie "ZOMBIE" Italian film "ZOMBIE"!
