I've seen some comments here about Brando using a southern accent, some of whom thought it was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. Jim Crow's laws were still in force. Civil rights were at the beginning. Would this be a subtle social comment, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? In the same way, MASH was a subtle critique of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki that appears "cold". Anyone in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least from my experience, did not tend to show emotions to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who meet single women. The Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture, and the wrong attempts to meet women were shocking to ladies. A feature of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or inconvenient, something many US military men took as a sign that their progress was welcome. Also, remember that at the moment of the film, Japan was just defeated, and occupation forces were dealt with a retained acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible interpretation of his situation. Looking at interaction with American actors, I brought some memories of my experiences in the country. I managed to meet a pair of beautiful ladies who, after convincing them that I was not the typical American man, taught me their language and culture during their time in their country.
