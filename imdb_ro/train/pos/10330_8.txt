This is actually a trilogy of three short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and is very enjoyable. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is fired from his church because he can not read or write. So what does he do? Open a tobacco shop, of course! The second is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I read about school six years ago, and I forgot immediately, until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes one, and also very good. She worked better on the film than in a book for me, but then maybe that's because I only had 14 last time afterwards. The third is almost an escape. Almost an hour in length, just shoot. It's not all that bad, but not as fast and fast as the last two. I followed the first half hour of it and then jumped back to the last quarter of an hour, and found that it still made sense, I really did not miss one thing that I gave 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
