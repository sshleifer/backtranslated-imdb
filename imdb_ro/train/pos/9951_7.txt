If you've ever wondered why I do not do pornography with a plot, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong credit both for the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong cast for adults to put a name on it behind it. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent that the majority of them do not have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue that binds sexual scenes together. These people simply can not act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to a ridiculous degree). However, I gave it a 7 because it was a beautiful attempt and it did not seem to be much of an effort to reduce the corners. I would also like to see more attempts like this. Perhaps one day I will see the perfect combination of pornography and plot.
