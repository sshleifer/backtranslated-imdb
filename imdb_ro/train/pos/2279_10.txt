Before this, the "Slaughter 5" malfunction was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Night" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery and intent of tragedy. Fortunately, he was not Hollywood or he was an idiot at the movie "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). It is probably true at the Champions' Breakfast, but they did such a bad thing that you better read the book and not see the movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this movie.
