I'm really addicted to Caprica, because it's a very good series of prequel for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow rhythm, but it surely picks up soon after the new episodes continue to fly. I've heard great things about episodes and upcoming stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This Sci Fi drama is sure to thank fans who love a mix of both genres. Eric Stoltz does an amazing job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br />
