"Johnny Dangerous" is a kind of hit and a comedy that laughs and "huh?". But I suggest you give her a chance. I think he's looking very much. Not so many people give this film a chance. Work. Think of it as a small parody of Goodfellas. Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And she does it well. Johnny Dangerous is a gangster who wants to go up alive. He only goes from big bosses to a beautiful wife. And of course, like many mobs, somebody wants him dead. 90% of the jokes laugh. As I said, give her a shot. Just take your favorite gangster movies and mix a comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerous". <br /> <br /> 7/10
