The most amazing, spiritual movie exalted about the restoration of the gospel. Much better than any other movie or movie about restoration so far. If you have not seen him, go on a plane to Salt Lake and see him now. You won t regret! You really have a feeling of what the first saints had to fight, putting total and total faith there, Prophet Joseph Smith. Finally, you will get an understanding of what the prophet had to fight and the persecutions that he and his people have encountered. If you have questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and about our humble beginnings, just watch this movie, it will have a complete and complete meaning afterwards.
