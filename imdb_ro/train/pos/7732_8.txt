The performances of this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric played a fantastic performance like "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the novel Jim Thompson. Too much superior to "The Grifters," which was a good film, this movie really remained true in the film fiction / noir movies from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all fans of the movie noir.
