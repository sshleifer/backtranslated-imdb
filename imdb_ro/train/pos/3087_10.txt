Six Degrees is a great show! I watched the entire online season since I just found it and was extremely disappointed that there will not be a season 2: "(and above all ABC took off-line so it can not be seen online what would make ABC such a wonderful show with an extraordinary line of stories and extraordinary characters just to get it out of the air without completing the story. It seems that it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to everyone all feel that ABC could at least place the show on-line for viewers who enjoyed it while continuing to broadcast over-rated TV shows.
