I saw the movie for the first time at the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of Conan Doyle and I really wonder what the fans of the sherlock think. I also think it is a movie for these fans if they agree or not with what is mentioned. You can ask that A.C. Doyle was a strong person or questioned. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was a kind of semi-biography? Not much less I've put this adaptation before, it's a movie that you have to see - even if you're not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look for it, enjoy yourself and have your opinion about it .
