Gentleman Jim is not a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. But after saying that, boxing scenes are a true eye-opener for the modern spectator. There is no 12 round, the points decisions here. Errol Flynn interprets the Irish banker who gets a world weight hit. Flynn is very fit for the role of suave, but unpredictable Corbett. His opponent John Sullivan is nevertheless better, however, a wizard of the old school played by Ward Bond. The theme of the movie is a man who pushes for his great chance. Corbett leaves behind his ordinary life and builds a new person like Jim Gentleman. Jim is a chancer that can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and selfish. Sullivan's Greek boxer champion is portrayed as a simple, but his honesty and athleticism convey a certain contrast to the main character. There is an aplenty action and enthusiasm and a wonderful conclusion with the necessary redemption for all. And Errol Flynn takes her face.
