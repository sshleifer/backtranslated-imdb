I saw the original English version of the video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe I'm saying that. The story is about a little boy who meets a girl with a history that is interwoven with his own. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and exciting topics in any animated movie. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you saw the Disney service from the Kiki delivery service, you can see the quality of the production. He almost redeems them because he stole the story of Kimba White Lion. (but not really!) Finally, Miyazaki's films are released correctly! I can not wait to see a naughty English version of Nausicaa!
