Henry Thomas was "awesome." His character kept my attention. I was so "in" the story I forgot it was not real. I wanted to keep the kid and see what a private person he was. The other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character. The way they got together to help each other was really inspired by astonishment. I love movies that show the real part of human emotions without the need to hit your head, that you are not smart enough to realize your things.
