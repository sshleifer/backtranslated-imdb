Full House is a great show. I'm still growing on him. I started looking at him when I was 8 years old and now I'm 12 and I'm still looking. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. had such a sense of humor. if there are people in this regard who do not see the show hard, you should because you will be connected to it. I became hanged by her after the first show I saw, which just happened to be the first episode in 2002. It's really a good show. I really think this show should go in several generations in families. and it's great because it's a good show for all ages. and for all parents, teaches them lessons on how to continue their lives. nothing terrible happens, such as violence or swearing. it's just a very good site. I give her 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? Oh and the best time to look is when you're home sick from school or even old office. It will make you feel much better. Believe me I'm not bad at home, but I still know it will make you feel better. and to all those who think the show is bad, well it's too bad for you because you will not get that far in life, even if you're happy with your life. you really should watch it and you will be caught up by it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and all the others who started to watch this wonderful show. well we need to go have a lunch. remember that you need to start watching the house full and soon!
