Hey, what happened. I'm the man, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ... ... you can not write a review of Sakura's script because I did not have one. As far as I know, the story was made just the way I went. I had the best moment in my life making that movie, and I touched so much I ran out of fun moments Jism ............ So glad you enjoyed the movie . I really did not get to the fights I imagined. Every time I made some moves, the war director continued to change them. However, we had an explosion and met some very good people. Especially the purple Ninja woman, which seems to fall out of the movie scene.
