Airwolf Film, A variation of the original 2-part pilot, However, the film, though shorter, contains additional images Unseen in the 2-hour pilot The pilot is far more pilot than the film If the pilot film is normally the same 2 ground floor combined) But the movie is actually a different editing with extras here and cuts there. It's worth watching, even if you have the season 1 DVD set, I'd still take a copy of the "movie" It's still in some stores such as virgin, Woolworths and like mixed stores, although it generally needs commands but saves the need to buy online (as many of us still do not and do not trust shopping online) but if you look around airwolfs in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really 1 of the less than 80 evaluated shows. <br /> <br /> A full-size Airwolf is currently being re-built for a helicopter museum:) Info and ongoing images have been over at http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It seems he finally to stay :)
