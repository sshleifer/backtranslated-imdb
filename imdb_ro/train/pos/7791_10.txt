Another of those movies you hear from friends (... or read about IMDb). There are not many fake notes in this. I saw almost everything happening with a young girl running from a home town in Tennessee to Florida, with all his worldly possessions in an old beaten car. Heroine, Ruby, makes some fake mistakes but learns from them. I woke up wondering why, why did not she bend more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons as it turns out. It's just a great movie. The only thing I do not like too much, I think, is the title.
