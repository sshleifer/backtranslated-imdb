Rohmer moves away from the usual middle-class French portraits to tell his drama about the costume of an aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What's more attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics Rohmer has done. The images have been digitally decorated and make them look like baroque images. In some moments you can not really say whether you are watching a movie or a series of pictures in the Louvre Musseum. Every hit is like a piece of art. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -------------
