It's so rare to find a movie that offers a plot that can not be found at every step. Surprising all the way. A few things I could not yet understand is that here you have the main female character who plays "good girl, hard worker" and yet, ultimately, being an anti-social beneficiary. That was not enough to make me not like, but she paused. The other thing I could not get was the old man who was shot by the police at the end of the movie. I did not realize who they were or what problems they had. If anyone has ideas, I'd like to find out what might be. The movie was exciting and funny, and it always left me guessing. It is very worthwhile to see.
