It is definitely one of the best stand-up shows of Jews. EVER. Eddie's so far down the wall I've been watching for seven years of damn performance, and still rocking every time. Everything, from its wide physical comedy to the little one at the top of the remark, is a masterpiece. You do not have to look beyond this line "The word of herbs, you say coat of arms and we say grasses, because it's in fiction." Brilliant.
