Action in this movie was superb, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa has made it a shocking heart. It was good that the isolated writer Boesman and Lena fled from their homes so we could fully share our triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and out. It's worth seeing when you place the film in its proper context.
