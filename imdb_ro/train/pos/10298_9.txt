I was glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie where overtaking was not the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things to happen to us and waiting for God to deliver. Morgan Freeman has made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us, still ready to take a little vacation when the occasion is presented. I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a bit too vulnerable and understanding of Carry's in principle the self-centered television station wanted to be, but that's how it is written. I think the previews have ruined many potentially very fun scenes, because everyone who saw them knew what was going on before it happened. /> <br /> I read a series of reviews and it looks like some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world, although there are some messages that we can all take. A funny movie.
