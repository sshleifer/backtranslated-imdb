One thing is certain ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story relies on a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin he can not bear. The story paints you rather than the usual explanation, so she asks you what's going on. Eventually the points are associated and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. There is no doubt that many moral questions are asked, but if you just accept and buy in his agony, then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree, it is irrelevant. The journey he leads is quite interesting, if not overwhelming. A pretty good movie that sadly leaves you a bit sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the way you have to think and not just look at explosions and fights.
