"Cinema is dead, live cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at the last Romanian film festival Anonimul, which reached its third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, Jafar Panahi was awarded the "Offside" award. I saw her tonight in Bucharest at the retrospective of the festival. Cinema is dead, but still very lively. Panahi's film tells in a convincing way what Iranian society looks like. Digital Filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that happened to Panahi's daughter: the problem and the risk occurred when it was decided to take part in a football match. This is forbidden in Iran because we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is to do by a few means, but perhaps with a lot of work, intelligence and humor, cultural models in a society that places women at a distinct level. The absurdity of laws becomes comical. The film has a happy ending, precisely because Iran's team goes to the World Cup. What I really appreciated was the concept, the idea behind this film. I would be very interested in seeing other Panahi movies, also prohibited in Iran. I think he can be considered an activist director.
