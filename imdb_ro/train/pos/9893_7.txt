Marty (Martin Scuddamore), an unfortunate man, was burned out by a tough April Fool hit. Flash has lasted for a decade, and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her transformations into Maniac, Faceless & Ultimate Film Horror) are psyched for the upcoming 10-year high school meeting without knowing that yard masked killer yard hiding in the school (now closed) and taking revenge. <br /> <br /> Chaulk this up until it was a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. However, there is only something about it, which makes me feel obliged to see it from time to time (preferably with beer in hand). I am even willing to go over the absolutely horrible end (which, I have to say, I hate) I think I like it because it has a funny atmosphere about it and some pretty refreshing killings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager both become topless <br/> <br/> Candy Eye (for ladies): A free shot by Simon Scuddamore at the beginning of the movie < > My Grade: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional Trivia Trajectory; trailer for this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
