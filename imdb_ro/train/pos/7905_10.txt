I'm really sorry for those who go to films with a pad and a pencil to write mistakes and keep notes about how bad a movie is. I equally feel contempt for those who go to the movies and can NOT suspend the reality and / or can not enjoy 90 minutes of their boring or crowded lives! Get a GRIP person. ECGTB is a very fun movie. If you are serious about movies, it is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to resemble the book in any way, this is not for you. But if you enjoyed a total defeat of Queen Priscilla of the desert or "what the hell see "by Moulin Rouge. Or the brutal comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" Then let yourself run into the Cowgirls. It has some very funny parts. Strangely. It also has very good music; kudos kd.lang. I also mentioned that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... do I need to say more?
