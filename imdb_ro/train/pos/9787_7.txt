This story is very beautiful. It is both sad and heart for a girl's journey to discover where it came from and where it goes. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident and, since being called the "miraculous child," she is dyslexic and finds her life a bit tough . Her findings along the way affect those close to her. Her relationship with her tutor and former guardian's lover is treated very delicately and sensitively, and the entire support piece is authentic, 3 dimensional and credible. Placed around a peach preserve in the small town of Australia, this is a gentle and erotic warm film and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits are closed. After reading some of the other rather little superficial comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think it was brilliantly expressed and was extremely sexy. No, it's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
