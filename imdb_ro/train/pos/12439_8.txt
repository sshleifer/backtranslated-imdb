While the main story should take place in Morocco, this film was shot in Romania in fog in 18 days on a very tight budget. However, their books could be broken, the actors and the crew will play it with remarkable skill and commitment, so in the end I found the result so appealing and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers a formidable performance as the bad guy. The scenario and direction offer some stones. Whether you like the movie or not, however, Alexandra Staden will probably be the main actor. Other commentators have highlighted Staden's inaction as Modesty Blaise. It might have a point, but I found her lovely and very good interpretation. Modesty succeeds to overcome terrible odds through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same thing here.
