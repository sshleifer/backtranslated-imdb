If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This movie has sweet songs, MJ as a robot and a crazy, confused plot. I remember, one night, going to this feature film in college and looking at the marvelous marvels of those who have decided to brighten up this ridiculous piece. There are a lot of songs. A lot of dances. There's a lot of singing while dancing. MJ will kill him as you would expect when it comes to these things. But there is much more to this film. There is plague. They're fat kids (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson has to fight in a dance (obviously also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not clay). RIP - we love Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
