I do not understand. Without being a critic, I do not assess the quality of the act, which I think is a good thing. My confusion lies in the content. No one is sensitive to the fact that these two women of unbelievers justify their infidelity to the men who fought and bled to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. If there had not been a prologue telling us if the men had done it at home, and if so, what effect did they have on their infidelity of "deception"? While these women took their paramours out of a sense of loneliness, did they think their husbands enjoyed being shot while facing daily death or dismemberment? They did not think of husbands at all! Just by itself. Excuse me, unless they want their husband to die.
