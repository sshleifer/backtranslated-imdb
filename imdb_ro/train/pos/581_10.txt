A river runs through it It's one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater, so the greatness of its cinema can really be appreciated. The actor is wonderful and undervalued, every gesture and smile and a knot bearing meaning. Brad Pitt offers a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is strong as the preacher's father. The movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to watch it through ebbs and flow, but it's worth it in the end.
