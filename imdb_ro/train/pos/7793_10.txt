My brother brought this movie home from the rental store and I remember he expects it to be such a boring one. I think the title made me more. I do not remember to start a movie with such little expectations and be so completely won. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother take her back to the store. It's rare for a movie to talk to me the way she did. I was completely caught up in Ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so fast. I could watch for hours. Another disadvantage is that I was dissatisfied with what Ashley Judd has done since then. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie is easy in my top ten favorites of all time.
