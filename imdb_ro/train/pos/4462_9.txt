One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh, features some memorable musical sequences such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi singing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with the Iturbi leadership and many others. Technicolor is perfect with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from underneath, through transparent keys, and singing by Grayson, seen by looking for another room. The plot is thin, but you get involved with Kelly & Sinatra's enthusiasm. Sailor's leave, he has to take home a fugitive boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To fix it with aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can make an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra's young and naive in this and his own singing words fall in love too quickly. While trying to contact Iturbi, which is never available, she starts to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly now falls in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination of live action / cartoon action with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more here that are worth watching. I give it to my new star because, although not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - is one of the first in their big techicolor production class (probably Meet Me In Louis a was the first) and better than most others.
