"One Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it's sure it's a good, funny comedy. The film focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after the bachelor party, with no memory, and Becky (Julia Stiles) sleeping naked in bed. Before he can figure out what happened, he removes Becky from his apartment, because he's Karen's (Selma Blair) engagement. After that, as you might imagine, the chaos appears. Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" produces strong laughter. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what can happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that he is not used at all. Although, it turns out to be more fun than Stiles' character, which is actually not so exciting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad, 7/10.
