Beyond the great divisions we call understanding, there are still many things we do not know about what was explained by the early tribal elders. In all cases, there is much to do with the dangers of knowing too much. Instead, there are those who warn us that we are not preparing for what they are warning of is "the time of the end." In this movie, called "The Last Wave," an aboriginal Hungarian is killed for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less, disturbing the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defense attorney to defend the accused. Though haunted by the prophetic images of his childhood and warned by the modern signs given to him by a sympathetic Aborigine named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend the crime as a tribal law and therefore not to obey the standard justice . The film is full of stunning, obscure images of the disasters of the apocalyptic world, and warns of the future tsunami and the disappearance of the island. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film a frightening allusion and is therefore not for the weak, in fact, the simplest haunting appearances can last for years in the nightmares of innocent filming. Good drama in silence. ****
