"Mother" is a weird, low-budget movie that touches at least two uncomfortable themes that are not usually explored in cinema: denial of mother love for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third era. <br /> <br /> The characters are awful: May is a disgusting old man and I think it is impossible to feel any sympathy or pain for her. She confesses she does not love her son and daughter. She twice cheated her husband with an intellectual. She steals his daughter's lover, not to protect her from a moral guy, she does not love her, but just because she feels excited about him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as she is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on having her store, a really terrible deal. Darren is a dependent amoral villain who does not like anyone, even himself. The action and the direction are excellent: actresses and actors have remarkable performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I admit it is recommended for a very specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Re-Start" ("Re-Start")
