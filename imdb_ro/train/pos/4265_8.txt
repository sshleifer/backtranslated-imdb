If you have not seen this little obscure charm, you should look for it. It's the story of a Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) of war that is listed 4-F every time trying to join any branch of the army. He finds a magical lamp, which of course contains a cute (Gene Sheldon), but the cute is even more stammering than MacMurray, sending it in time to serve in all times and places the wrong way than the one he wants. It is a cute, cheerful and pure puff, and you can not help, but you like it. Parcels are much like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) made numerous Disney movies in the 50's and 60's, though not together. Needless to say that everything ends well for everyone, and the spectator disappears feeling good.
