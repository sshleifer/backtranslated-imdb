I've seen this movie twice with the teens who love it. This should be a wreck of worship! Best Line: "Your dress is cool!" says Prince at Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I like the cars and motorcycles of the 1950s. The melancholic prince is a big deviation from the typical wizard. He tries to stay cool but fails to hide his love for the fairy princess. Her pants are not glass (true to the original story), but Cinderella loses is still, but gets it back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems almost impossible to achieve. We hope Blockbuster or Amazon will start storing it soon.
