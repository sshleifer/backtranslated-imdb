The Cinderella Story is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, Sleeping Beauty, which was also transformed into a Disney movie in 1959; this movie is a sweet, delightful masterpiece from Disney. The movie has a large soundtrack; this one likes in a movie is a very good soundtrack and I like the songs; my favorite song is romantic "That's Love". I like the film mice, they are nice. My favorite scene is the scene after the narrative, the little birds tried to awaken Cinderella in the morning; I also like when the friends of the Cinderella animals (mice and birds) fix the birth of Cinderella's mother so that she could go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia broke it in pieces, *** es!
