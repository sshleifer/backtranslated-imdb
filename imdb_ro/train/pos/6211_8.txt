The fleet was launched in 1936, in the middle of the depression, when people were in a difficult world to find jobs or even find food to put it on the table. In Europe, Hitler was in full ascension, along with other nationalist / socialist victims. In the United States, the Cartel seeds sowed with the Federal Reserve Act and the income tax amendment (16) began to yield to the connected financial capital and their domineering secret societies. <br /> <br /> For the average guy and girl, the times were tough. Do you come to Hollywood with at least some hopeful pictures? I do not think we can properly call them propaganda at this time, even if this film revolves around naval warfare exercises. The real problem for boys and girls, as it is now, was how to connect with the right one, lead a decent life, have wonderful children, with a modest grace and elegance. <br /> <br /> The chances were long. <br /> <br /> For a complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, visit my TheCoffeeCoaster.com site. <br /> <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
