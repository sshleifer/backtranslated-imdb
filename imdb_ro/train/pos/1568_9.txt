Catscratch is the best thing to get out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show appeals not only to Maoris and PI. some people love her, and all are aussies. At first glance, I admit it seems a bit cruel, but it grows a lot on you. Also, to correct something that one of the other critics said, In_ Correct (Tv.com) does not say, "Does that mean you're a homo now?" he says, "Does that mean you're a homo, owww?" This is his expression in the show. Mister. Blik is, I think, the funniest of all as Peww-Weww's Playhouse <br /> <br /> First, I will recognize that the early episode was a bit good. But after a while the episodes have become great! And just when the series found it to be surreal, whacky ... Nickelodeon is canceling it! I know that Nick is intended for children, but from time to time there is a bright show that can be brought by teenagers and adults. These shows include Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (Occasionally) and Invader Zim. All of these must have been considered too good except CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. What I like about the famous final episode, where Gordon struggles with a duck. /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with lots of audio and docos behind the scenes, including the last episode. But, of course, what I definitely liked to see the show come back in the air. Wake NICK! I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the closure credits. That would be great.
