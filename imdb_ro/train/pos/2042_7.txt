STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Good ** You can go out for a table in return * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Angry career Kate (Franka Potente) heading for London underground to catch a train to meet George Clooney. However, after a busy day of work, she moves away and wakes up to find herself alone in a deserted platform. While falling in love with a situation that leads her from one daunting encounter to another, she learns something much worse and bad that awaits her there. In many ways, the British film industry really becomes one of three films, such as Creep and success 28 days later (which has strong echoes in parts). In terms of success in what he wants to do, Creep creates intelligently (especially at the beginning) a scary feeling of isolation and tense fear. In the smart working time, too (though, unconsciously, I guess), I can pay tribute to some of the great 70s pioneering films that rely on shock and fear without focusing too much on character development such. From its weaknesses, some scenes are unpredictable, but they do not really make it less frightening or effective in any way. I'm not sure if finishing was meant to make it a morality game and it's not perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves the very good base function. ***
