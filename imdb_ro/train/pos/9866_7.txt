I've seen ICE AGE, a very funny and very beautiful movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are appealing and beautifully developed, but what shines is digital design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animation than reality, the designs give you a true looking world in a stunning use of color. Sometimes the glow of reality shines (especially because the water was impressive), but it is still a fantasy world based on reality. Including a host of great landscapes helps in particular to minimize playback costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical glamor, it shines with an efficient use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Quite technically, the movie is fun, family-friendly and sometimes very funny.
