I saw this movie for the first time when it was broadcast on Trio Trio Channel a few years ago, and I watched it again - with sans - on Sundance. I was impressed for the first time and I found it even more involved in the second view. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical comment stands out as a big finger - but collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. The best show: the amazing final segment of Shohei Imamura, which contemporary critics such as Mick LaSalle Grosolan have somehow interpreted as an attack on "terrorists," but is now portrayed as an anti-war polemic. The opening part of Samira Makhmalbaf, who succeeds in combining profound empathy for September 11 victims with a pre-school concern for Afghan children; and a childish Idrissa Ouedraogo's childish crusade for Osama Bin Laden - an almost as serious and successful hunt as an enterprise for REAL Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble experiment if it fails, at least having the courage to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and CIA, and although the study of Sean Penn's character seems to there is no place, it is still an effective and bitter film. Overall, essential viewing and an unpleasant vision better than Oliver Stone's World Trade Center reactive center.
