The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of smoke sweepers works surprisingly hilarious. He guarantees some fun and silly antique stories, especially from Stan Laurel, as usual. The film also has a subplot with a walnut teacher working on a rejuvenating formula. It does not really sound like a logical mixture of story lines and incoherent lines, but both lines of plot mingle perfectly towards the memorable end. It's still a little weird, but funny though, so it works for the movie. The sustained distribution of the film is surprising. Sam Adams is great as a stereotype butler, and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over him as a walnut teacher. The film is filled with a few excellent, timid and hilarious sequences, all of which are quite predictable, but you become hilarious to follow, however, because of the way everyone is executed. Everything helps transform Dirty Work into one of Laurel & Hardy's best shorts. <br /> 8/10
