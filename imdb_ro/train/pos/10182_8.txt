good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. but the main point again as his films tend to be, man is the best actor in the idiom and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar. this may be the second best performance after the whip (others may disagree). though other movies are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint you. Good film, though I think Shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have done without. you can see in his movies, others are trying very hard to reach his heights and act on the leather. but this man is indeed something elase. the movie is cool, the music and the direction is excellent plot a little thin, but the game on the screen and dialogue again very well. you have to watch.
