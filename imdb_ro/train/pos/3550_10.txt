That's why the genre was created. Humor, talent, romance and action have rolled into one. Frank Sinatra was great. Nothing else has to be said. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, did a great job, winning the hearts of many, through the portrait of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added to his character. The ladies in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie certainly stole the show. It is a classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with the audience and makes you smile and laugh. Surely a movie that must be watched and enjoyable!
