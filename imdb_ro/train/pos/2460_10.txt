Hamlet is by far my favorite of all of Shakespeare's work. Branaugh is an actor heck. His representation was amazing. His soliloquies were amazing. As long as it was a rare film to keep my interest, I was still included in this piece. I recommend this to anyone who likes both Shakespeare's fans and those who are not so much. This has everything the modern world is looking for in its films: murder, treason and deception. Not to beat Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole work. This leaves no untouched stone. When you finish the movie, it will feel as if you read the song yourself. How do you say "two fingers up".
