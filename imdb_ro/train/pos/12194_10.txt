The Surreal Noir movie was released shortly after the classic "The Definitive Genre" "Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman always starts twice". Welles films should not be evaluated against others. He played by different rules. Actually, play. This starts when other fatal feminine films are left so that the vague logic (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a Wellesian scene screen (typical hot fire style) dialogue (a lot of hot iron philosophy) (good Hayworth , probably intentionally unidimensional). Welles 'genus' would have meant "a formula," but he seemed to like to use "mysteries" as a backdrop for his "fun".
