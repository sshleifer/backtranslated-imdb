An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a crime detective. Paul Winfield was an undervalued actor who withdrew all his roles with such ease, it was hard to say that the man really acted. Perhaps best known by young viewers like the voice / narrator of "City Confidential," Winfield finishes his career with such a big film; but, as always, Winfield shines. A treatment to follow. Erika Eliniak is fine, Erika Eliniak, cute to look at him, but leaves much to be desired in the acting department. However, to be fair, this is one of her best efforts. Bottom Line: A thriller that can be watched, which should not be lost by any Paul Winfield fan. A decent telefilm to send Paul Winfield to the celluloid sky. What actor. It will be missed.
