Bizarre, trippy, look for a story-and-steep-forward sci-fi budget about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witnesses to a series of events that grow in their strange level; they seem to have been caught in a temporal warp where past, present, and future collide. This is an excuse for a parade of extremely fun special effects - a constant show of light and sound, dinosaurs like creatures that have each other, a little and little ET friend who delights the niece, and so on. This image presents a little imagination, if not something else. Very beautiful music by Richard Band, hiring special working effects from David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a pleasant family are key assets. It generates a sense of astonishment as a child; it would be very good that it is rather a romp for children (or children inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in narration or presentation. It was hard for me to resist; is a short and sweet diversion (80 minutes) and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (renowned the "Spider kingdom") and executive producer Charles Band.
