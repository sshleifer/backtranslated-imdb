I remember seeing this movie at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the body that rejected the dead in it was the most frightening part of the film for me, intensified only by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until I recognized the part of the film in which Blackwood's surname was changed from Blackblood due to the fact that in the history of the family there was a known person for his many hangings by different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to take his blows from adding to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that as Foster first enters the gate of the cemetery, he carefully observes the sharp object of the gate where he meets him. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror film lovers.
