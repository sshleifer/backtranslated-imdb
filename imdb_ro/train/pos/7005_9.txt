When the DVD was released, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on my way as I expected before I bought it. The wonderful film about what else I can say to Will Smith was a wonderful actor as always in action or serious movies. It always provides a record breaking performance. I think this is the movie after August Rush, which makes a person cry while he is following her. The way the director described the story was really wonderful. His previous life and new life in the film were well-designed for the public. I really could not find any blame in the story or the way I pull it. I think its DVD should be a household, because this will really be a nice thing for your collection. It's not the movie that needs pop-horn for joy, it's the movie that lets the audience learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see during viewing. And I advise those people who are critics of the film, please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie, then please talk to me.
