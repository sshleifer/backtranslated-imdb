Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie in Japan. I noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who liked Versus's debut film of this director or the third Azumi film. I hear there are filthy blooded movies, with swords and zombies and all sorts of goodies. Honestly, I went to the video store to get versus, but I'm fine with Alive. If you are looking for the beginning of the wall end to wall action then Alive is not your choice. There is plenty of action, but it comes as a pay-off for an entire hour of accumulating characters. Personally, I think it is well done and worth it. Of course, part of the plot is bad as many SCI-Fi movies and I think subtitles that use the term foreign object could have replaced with parasites for a greater effect. This movie is brutal when it must be so weak of the heart does not have to apply. They have kept the budget down by mostly limiting all the actions to an underground building (taking a cube sign), but the film does not suffer for it. Another bonus for this film is intense Gothic images that are made with a great artistic flair during several retrospectives and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
