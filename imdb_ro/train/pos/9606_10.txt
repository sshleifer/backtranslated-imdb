This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit the exact place of what is really bulimia and how it is not always to be weak and diet. It has shown how people with bulimia tend to think of things like their vision of life, friends and themselves. The best line and side that really shows what the Bulimia problem is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. He showed that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of what they have to do with someone else. It has to do with them and only with them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with this problem instead of paying attention to us. She showed that Beth had to call attention at that point and that she needed her mother's attention at that time at most.
