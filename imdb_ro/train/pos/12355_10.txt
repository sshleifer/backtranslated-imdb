I can understand those who do not like this film because of the lack of knowledge. First of all, those girls are not geisha, but brothel tenants and those who do not know the difference will not understand half the movie, and certainly not the end. This is a complete work about the lives and needs of women in this age. Everything is important, and surely how it gets dressed, in the whole movie means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geese film, I suggest you read a little about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality. This is Kurosawa's work on my life, and I'm sure the director understands the silent meaning of Kurosawa's play to the right intellectual.
