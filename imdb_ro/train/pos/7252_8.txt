I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through the basic training, at first difficult and then I progressed much easier. My time was spent during the NI tribulations and the cold war. There have been times when I asked myself what I was involved in, not for a long time, because training will always take over and you will always react instinctively. The voice used to show what the soldiers think is on the spot, although it would have added my breathing and heart rate, because this seems to get into ear drums in given situations. A few years later, I was in Canada for a family to get together. An aunt who lives in the US and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio has done a paper about the effects of the British Army in the NI. He spent some time there researching. Although an ex bed was very anti-British. He made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer was to watch the movie "A Long Day of Death." It is the closest civilian who will understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is correct at the end.
