The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the successful Danish TV series is a bit inferior to the first one, but it also has many laughter and frustrations. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, such as the monster child and his demonic father. Other outstanding pieces are Søren Pilmark's doctor Krogshoj, who has to face Dr. Helmer's terrible revenge, and once again Mrs. Drusse, a patient, tries to solve the mysteries, the Miss Marple style. Starting from a cliffhanger and after the death of the leading actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs Drusse), you are wondering how they will ever be part III, but I hope Von Trier will give you a chance. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the dishwasher for Down's Syndrome, died shortly thereafter. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
