This is a very beautiful and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent musical score. I was twice in Japan last year and the film gave me the typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the room is superb as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and nice and everything is very well brought here. The director plays gorgeously with light and colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you'll want to see more from the same director. It's a real movie and I can recommend it to everyone.
