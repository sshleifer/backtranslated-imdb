I would just like to say that no matter how low the film budget is, the point of view of these films must be shown all over the world. We do not read that anymore, instead, people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD, it made me want to read the whole series, and I want more. YOU REPLY ALL 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the characters but ruin the effect. Because I grew to love the actors who played the characters. YOU REPLY ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message and look at the message that these books and movies are here to be presented. We do not have enough. A TREABA EXCELLENT !!!
