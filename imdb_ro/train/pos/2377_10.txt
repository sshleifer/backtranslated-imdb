I've waited a long time for someone to shoot a faithful version of H.G.'s classic novel. Wells, "The World War". Timothy Hines did it in the end! I could not believe how good it was! From act of action, to the costume, outside of this special world, I can not say enough! Was awesome! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performance by a top cast! It must be seen to be believed. Certainly not. And I read all these negative comments from the others and I can not believe what they say. I probably watched another movie, right? And those real comments of that Vpspian guy, whoever he is, does not know what he's talking about. Good work continues, sir. Hines.
