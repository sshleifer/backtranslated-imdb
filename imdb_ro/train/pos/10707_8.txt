For a movie that had little publicity and few people heard about it, this was pretty good. It is another of these modern British criminal films that are weird ("Snatch", "Beast Sexy", etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch," but it's interesting and has some heavy characters. It also has a horn and somewhat predictable, ends, but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting to the viewer for the first time. Basically, it's a British male man who sends for a Russian "bride-to-order bride", ending with the help of two male Russian men, offering some big surprises. Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman, and they are very good, like Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is another kind of film and well-acting. Kidman proves once again that he is far more than a beautiful face.
