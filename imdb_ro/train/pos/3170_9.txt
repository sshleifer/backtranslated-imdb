Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones is headed for wonderful things. This is the thought I had when I saw his movie "Cross Eyed". Rarely an independent film lets me feel as good as his. An intelligent, hard-led letter, "Cross Eyed" involves you from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "Featured Actors", it would be an Office Box feeling. I think he still has the chance to be seen by a mainstream audience if a single film distributor takes time to work on this movie. Regardless of where it ends, if you have the chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
