Twisted, bizarre, delightful and hilarious! I could not help watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on his family video camera that was growing in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a maker of emerging movies and his motivation and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a powerful word, but are not we all looking at movies that have to be manipulated in one way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was amused by the fact that the boys in the movies seemed to come out without their shirt whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on his gay homosexuality, and you can see it from the suggestions (great suggestions!) Of flamboyance at an early age. Maybe it was the hot weather in Southern California, who knows? As a homosexual who grew up in a care environment, it is wonderful to see that his parents supported him and loved him and that his friends seemed excited about his talent behind the lens. Put the room on me "gives a look back to the 80s of untouchable commercialism.You will remember hair, music and fashion.I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the journey back to the memory band was welcome. sound synchronic dance is useless, enriched by Frankie Goes To Hollywood's T-shirt .The movies deal with dark themes in time Child abuse, the Holocaust, nuclear warfare, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction No childhood is completely worry-free and the way Stein deals with these topics is interesting to say at least and hilarious to look at. Watch as fast as possible!
