In Hollywood, Holly comes from a small Texas city, sings "Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local contest and is admitted to a Philadelphia prestigious art college. From there, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I liked this movie. It was full of great songs and actors and characters who kept the movement at a very beautiful pace. The actress was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were remarkable as well as Nick Roth. Working with the room was really well done and I was very pleased with the end (It seems that a sequel could be done). Kudos the director and all those who participated in this production. Quite a jewel in the movie archive.
