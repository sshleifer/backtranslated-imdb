I was delighted to finally see the release of Amazing Stories first season on DVD. I forgot why a number of stars and star directors worked in this series. For the longest time, the only way to see this remarkable series was VHS 2 or 3 episodes, or when Sci-Fi will resume the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi would accommodate re-runs, they were generally the same episodes. There have been some remarkable episodes in Season One as the Mission they have not repeated. Does anyone know exactly how long the series has passed? It is said that 1985 until 1987 was on top of the IMDb, but I thought it went more than two years. If you've loved Twilight Zone, Nightlife and Outer Limits, you'll enjoy this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
