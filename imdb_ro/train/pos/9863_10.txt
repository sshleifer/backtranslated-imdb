I thought the ice age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman with no children, it seems to me that I really enjoy these humorous and lively animated films. Sid is the best character I've ever seen, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was very humorous and I did not think his character could be even or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I obviously have it) and quote the movie at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I like this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to realize what the squirrel tells him about the "tigers" ... "Wolves pack, bears pack, flea package, moss pack, nose pack, a dermis package?" a pack of lies, a pack of troubles, a wall pack, a pack of birds, a packet of flying fish ... "or yet that part goes! This is the funniest part of the whole movie, although I also enjoyed the humor behind the "putting lazy on the map" and many other parts. The only animated film that can be compared with Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
