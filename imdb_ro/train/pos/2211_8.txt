I do not see a lot of television except the Office, Weeds, Entourage and Ema's Soup. I think I keep the show in the good company. I like the shaking review of the pop culture this show offers. Soup also helps me to remain at the forefront of what people in the office refer to when they talk about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). The best part is that Soup presents the most important clips of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (for example, most people are piling up to see American Idol because of the weird audience show) , which is why most people claim they are looking. And that means I do not have to suffer through the other 98% of these talk talks or "reality" for a "funny" or "shock" nugget. The only reason why soups do not get a 10 in my opinion are sometimes the sketches are not so funny, and in a rare event, the comment is not always up to the point. But they can not be all home run, or, if yes, Soup would not be on E !. <br /> <br /> Joel's spirit and Soup's writing team (which includes McHale) makes for a great show. I happen to enjoy the laughter and crew comments that are out of the room. Even when obviously obvious by laughing occasionally, it is hilarious because it is forced. They are obviously ironic. And that's part of what makes this fun show.
