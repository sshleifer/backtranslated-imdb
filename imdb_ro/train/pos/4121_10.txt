It tends to get lost by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It's an episodic study with more characters about the poorest people in Tokyo, living in a literal city made of garbage. Although it seems to have been hit by a bomb A, the film has a serene beauty due to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the crazy young man who leads an imaginary cart through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories are piling up, but maybe the most tragic one is about the man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When not looking for food, they spend their spare time with imagination to build their dream house. An emotionally beautiful film.
