I saw her like a TV movie late last night just by chance. The blur of the movie said something in the sense that Mom rests with her daughter and travels on a romantic journey, as I did where the carpenter is hard to work at a new conservative - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot it was immediately obvious. <br /> <br /> It seems that the interest of the mother's father's father's love is also the daughter's friend, so there are smoking problems and not too many surprises. But I was caught by Anne Reid's convincing performance and I was mad. The direction allows him plenty of space to look into the mirrors and adjust the scarves when it emanates sadness. Sexual scenes were fascinating and taboo breaking. Should the bodies of elderly women not be covered? Not here and we are treated for a delicious replay in the mother's sexuality. Even more amazing are the drawings she made (SPOILER!) Once discovered she confirms her daughter's suspicion that something is happening here. Cathryn Bradshaw as a daughter does not convince me enough like the rest but it could be me. With her waves of pre-Raph locks, I expected Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have been more appropriate for confrontations in my mind. Bradshaw has a happier, happier face that has not produced the mania that comes out of the progress of the movie. The end is weak. If they say goodbye to the mother, while they go to shame, they are so indifferent, then we can see some wonderful views of those who are goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. No matter what she did, she is a recently lost widow, leaving for the lonely house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of sympathy. For a movie so excited (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you will never get the cover anymore) the end is a cold contradiction.
