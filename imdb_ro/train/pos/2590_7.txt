People who are bad-mouthing this movie are those who do not understand the movie to start with. These are the ones who love successful films and the negative film for any star star star Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a wonderful movie that may seem strange and maybe stupid in the beginning, but what he lacks in the plot is more than he does in substance. One thing especially about the movie that impressed me with the use of music, which plays an important role. Those students of film music will see how important the music is in the movie, both in Vida's and Wilder's life, and in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence and it's funny how some of the lyrics are playing. For example, in the scene where people sing "The Duke of Earl," Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "She's my daughter," then goes to Wallace to give her something when men sing "She's gonna be my girl ", showing intelligently the tension between the two brothers. There are all sorts of small intricacies like this inside the movie and, although it may seem like a flop outside, the real student of the movie will see how good this movie really is.
