It was fabulous! Photography, editing, cinema, combined music to carry us on the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the pleasure to "replenish" without going through danger. I was there! The dream sequences and the end of the retrospective were fresh. He talked to me. Keep up the good work! Another genre is the City of God. Also - do not laugh! - Comedy, Seeking Desperately Susan. Typical overall levels with excellent performance by all. I'm sorry, I think the Training Day also matches the genre, with fantastic performances made by an overall cast. I had to pass the channel on some sequences, but all in all, a great movie!
