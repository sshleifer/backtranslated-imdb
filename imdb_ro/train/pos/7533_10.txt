I liked this series when it was on WB for children, I did not think there was a Batman to see how the original performance ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I liked the idea that Robin let Batman solve the crime himself. It was an interesting perspective for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in series, and once again, like his predecessor, this show had excellent story lines, an extraordinary animation (better than the original), a fantastic voice work, of course, a bright writing. The only thing I did not like was when he was in the US that he'd often led episodes in a 15-minute story. I just want some of the episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of any cartoon Batman comes in this series, and is called "Over the Edge," in my opinion, as good, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's calculation." In general, a beautiful pursuit, along with Superman, this show made me very happy childhood.
