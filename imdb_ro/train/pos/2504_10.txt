When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is that it involves vampires that make incredible stunts. The waterfalls are very similar to the way the Matrix moves, such as passing too fast to make bullets and jumping very close. Another reason why the movie is good is that the adorable anime faces them during the movie. The way Gackt faces his faces or the way he works, VERY ANIMALS. I think it's a great movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are the fans of Gackt and Hyde, you need to see it.
