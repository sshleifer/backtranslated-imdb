Disney could be just something here. First of all, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth involving sports and a small town in Middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... yet another sport based truth story. Both movies move you to tears sometimes, and both make you smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I took The Rookie and we expected it to be a great movie. We were not disappointed when I was asked if we would buy this DVD when it came out, it was crazy. The safest.
