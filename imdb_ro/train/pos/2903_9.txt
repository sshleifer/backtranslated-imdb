Tiempo de valientes is a very fun comedy action. After his great punch film called El fondo del mar and the spectacular Los Simuladores television program, Damian Szifron made another great work. Tiempo de valientes shows for a moment a Hollywood film. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here they have great performances. The movie is very fun and funny and has great moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very fun comedy comedy we all recommend if you want to have a great time. And I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
