Because of a modern sensitivity, it's sometimes hard to watch older movies. It's annoying to look at the stereotyped sunflower library to take off his glasses and become nice and bad to win a man. Especially a man so superficial and unconstant. He is obviously a player (I would not trust him to remain true to her), who does not want to settle, which only looks at attractive women and always calls them "child" (ick!). Even after he has completely changed his appearance and life for him, he only goes to her after he (presumably) has been rejected by another woman and finds out that Connie has spent all her money to renovate a boat for him. I wanted her to stand up to him, not to follow him! His sudden conversion in minutes was totally unrealistic and did not go for me. Apart from this subplot, I liked the movie. How do you not like sailors to dance with each other? (You can say that they were from San Francisco .... D) The rehearsal dance was great, looking at Ginger Rogers intentionally to fall and get out of the "correct steps" it was great. The last dance scene "Make the music" with beautiful costumes and the set of deco art was beautiful. And I was very happy with "I saw the sea" (though they used it several times too many times, as if they had realized it was the best song). <br /> <br /> However, the plot was a bit weak, like most of the musicians (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dance deserves to watch the movie. I'd like to have some pictures from San Francisco since the movie should have been set. It's also strange to see a naval movie with a light heart, with the knowledge of what Hitler was doing at that time. I have to try to break all the knowledge to gather myself into a fancy earth.
