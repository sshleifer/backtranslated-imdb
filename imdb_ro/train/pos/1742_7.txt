Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I have seen in the last ten years. Excellent performances (especially yiannis zouganelis are wonderful), well written scriptures and an efficient direction from a very special, auteur. A film, obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's straw dogs, could be a masterpiece if he eventually avoided some obvious and exaggerated situations and symbolism. However, this is a film that deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek films that should be watched outside of Greece. It is a shame that in Greece it did not work commercially, in addition to other fake and gloomy productions such as Politiki Kouzina.
