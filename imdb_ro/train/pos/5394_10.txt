I was absolutely fascinated by this series since Tom Long got shot - everything that was "bad boy" was just addictive. The story went crazy, what's going to happen - Joey finally gets her face, after she's done 5 years in prison and all the time to think of her lost love, crossing her tracks with her again , discovering he has a son ... Although it is a violent evil to find happiness. A real captivating two ground floor - please bring it to the video!
