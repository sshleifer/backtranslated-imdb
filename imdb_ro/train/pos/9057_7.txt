Let's keep it simple: my two children were stuck to this film. He has his own defects from the perspective of adults, but he buys some worms and he's just enjoying it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Pepsi woman was excellent! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> That's not a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you look at just once. Do not buy the DVD. Enjoy! Did we mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for Dad.)
