I watched fragments of this as a child, but while I bought the Blue Underground set immediately because it was a limited edition, only now I got into my viewing program - and that's mainly because Bakshi's American POP 1981) just returned to the late Italian television (see the review of the movie below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found my film to be a pretty good epic of sword and witty animation, with particularly impressive foundations (pretty awkward rotoscopic characters were, of course, less) score. Again, the plot was not exactly original, but it turned out to be undeniably involved at a minor level, and the top characters were developed enough - especially the terrible Ice-Lord Nekron and the enigmatic Darkwolf fighter; the heroine and the heroine are still gentle stereotypes - but can not complain when Bakshi and Frazetta describe the fetish equally well-endowed (her bra can be torn apart every second) and half naked in her boots I'm forever disappearing her ass)! However, it is clearly a action-oriented piece and certainly offers on this front (which implies that Darkwolf is particularly wild); the end of the showdown, though short, is also treated beautifully and sees our heroes pterodactyls storming the wrath of villains in a cave. In the long run, besides the above-mentioned Frazetta peaks, the main appeal of this film to me is now his nostalgic factor as he transported me back to my childhood days to watch not only films such as CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and BEASTMASTER (1982), and animated television series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN and THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85). As for the companion "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> The antique character of the animated sword and witch movie, which is available only by printing VHS owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! The rotoscope technique is detailed, and there are also several examples of scenario scene scenarios (in a studio) - which will then be followed, mixed with the background, and filmed. However, after watching several such scene scenes in the animation art (for example, on the Disney and Looney Tunes sets), it's not a very compelling piece ...
