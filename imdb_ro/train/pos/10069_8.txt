This film is worth seeing for the visual beauty and the movement that acts alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both reunited as a supporter of a transvestite opera star) are condemned to be relegated to subordinate roles in China. This makes the unlikely connection between an old street interpreter and a young girl even stronger than a triumph over native culture. The only problem I had with this movie was the sound of the soundtrack to inflate with excitement rendered unnecessary by the performance of the actors. A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer movies.
