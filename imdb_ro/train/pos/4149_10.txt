Reading some of the comments on the discussion boards here I expected this movie to be a complete disappointment - but when I watched it I could not help laughing! It's officially my new favorite movie. I do not know what is hate here, maybe because a movie of this kind has never been in the past. I lost myself to call another comedy completely led by women. A lot of comedies will have one or two actresses in the forefront, but there will be a lot of male support characters. This was almost ALL women - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's brief appearance - and it worked. All actresses have played very fun shows (especially Missi Pyle) from a strange and glamorous scenario. The charm of this film seems to me to be in her subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships, and breaking gender roles. However, each of the main characters faces a challenge because their attempts to be more "fun", conflicts with their feminist values ​​and about which they knew they were. Missy Pyle has proposed that the film has missed a theatrical release because of her feminine pouring and the lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind her and I have to agree. Everyone I recommended the movie loved and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has not been widely accepted and successful. We highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind or a woman-centered comedy love.
