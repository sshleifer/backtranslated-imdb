There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can not I really do that? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I am serious. Do not watch this movie if you are slightly offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and anything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and that can not be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all the other debuts, I think Baseketball is the winner of the prize. I'm laughing now, just thinking about some stupid things I do in the movie. Look at the film!! That's all I'm going to say. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a damn word in almost every line that fades out of his mouth when he speaks. So I keep it professional. The best movie. Heck da!
