OK, first a patch correction posted on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go with his sister in the movie and did not stop at his sister's tomb. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was a close friend of Lincoln on Sale Salem. Some say Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. Currently, there are films and fiction in this movie. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license with something under the sun and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the film's case is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely fictionalized in this film with numerous name changes, the Monitor. This is Hollywood's golden age with the best drama, and Henry Fonda probably offers the best Lincoln played by anyone.
