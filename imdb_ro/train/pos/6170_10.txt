I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and I was just overwhelmed by this. He is a rich novel, warmly brought to the screen, handsome and well guided. Moreover, he reminded me of David Lean's films, both in his ability to deal with a complex story, and in his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you at many different levels. The best movie I've seen over the years.
