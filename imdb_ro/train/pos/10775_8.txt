Beautiful movie with a great soundtrack that stretches out on the rock scene of the '70s and' 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (the hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describes the lives of young people and their world-related problems. Reminds Trainspotting with a touch of Italian touch.
