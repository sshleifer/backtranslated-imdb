This is the favorite movie of all time, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very intelligent. Not to mention, this movie contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; as if I put all my eggs in one basket and talk to music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the movie that presented me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose that for this reason will always keep a special place in my heart (I'm sorry for the sentimental, but I I'm the woman so go over that) in all this movie gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was superb and also Lucille Ball is doing it even more wonderful.
