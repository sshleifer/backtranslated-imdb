This film is one of the few quality films in 2000 and certainly one of my best. The script is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the big screen transfer is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent, just like the act of Turturro and Watson. Turturro certainly offers the best performance so far, proving that it deserves much more than we thought. Watson also plays brilliant. The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a nonlinear time, with several flashbacks of Luzhin's childhood. Through these, Luzhin's complexity is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say, but to suggest this movie to anyone.
