I was very moved by the story, and because I'm going through something similar to my parents, I'm really connected. It's so easy to forget that someone whose body fails was once a vibrant and passionate one. And then there are the mistakes they have made and they have to live. I liked the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? It's fantastic! A true breakthrough. There is probably the most erotic scene I have ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it has been done so nicely. Overall, the look of the movie was amazing, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, humanizing a man who is spinning down. I liked the way the director approached the life of this woman, she was never sentimental, never too much - enough to delight, but not enough to play.
