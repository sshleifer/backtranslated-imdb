"Luzhin's defense" is a good film with central performances, but too much of the novel and not remarkable enough to produce the film. For most of the film, it was felt that the characters only helped push the narrative. Marlene Gorris could possibly have examined Luzhin's psyche, rather than describing him as an innocent tortured victim broken by the cruel motives of others. Adaptation of screenwriting is a difficult task, written in the early twentieth century. This film does not go deep enough in the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's ritual with her mother is confronted with a mother's chirlish misunderstanding rather than with a dramatic flash point in the movie. I felt I was subjected to Luzhin's torment and the last tragic end, without the pleasure of revealing his unusual and complex personality. However, it was a moving and enjoyable movie, but certainly not an extraordinary one.
