This movie has been for a while in my collection, but it was not before a friend of mine reminded me of it? until I decided I should look at her. Did not I know much about approaching Leo? just that he had to be excellent coming out of the age film and dealing with a very serious subject? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has help ??? is Leo? the script stretches around how Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) is joining with the sickness of his relatives. At first everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel? is he thought he is too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to rejecting parents to discuss the issue with young Marcel. I know from experience that, on many occasions, most elderly people do not want to accept that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean they can not accept reality and will not act in a manner more appropriate than themselves. Except that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they gave me a pretty big impression? how did they support their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and illness. The fact that he allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend was a big gesture from them? most families I know will be reluctant to do so. Is there a lot of heat in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together? you can see them as true friends, worried about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I recommend
