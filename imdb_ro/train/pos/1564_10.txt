Chloe is mysteriously saved by Dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with Belle Reve skills to Project 33.1 and a fraction of a second later, Clark. He discovers that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and is meeting in Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a break in a LuthorCorp unit, Clark discovers that the Green Arrow had hired Bart (aka Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to participate in their mission. "Justice" is the best episode so far this season. In this episode, the League of Justice begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular, completing the organization required for teamwork. Eventually, Oliver breaks out of Lois on account of the importance of the fight against criminals and Lex's secret laboratories around the world. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
