First of all, I think the comment below is unworthy of such a site. Obviously, you do not taste and do not respect the taste of others. I do not give you a history lesson, but I think it should be done. The black actors there are only if not more successful than others. If you are not part of the "Black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and vibrancy of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since, unfortunately, you are not black, you are not happy to feel what we feel when watching these classics, so you have to keep your closed mouth shut and stay in the non-dancing race. Thanks.
