All dogs in the sky are, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not a big fan of animation movies, but there's something about it that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. Music is wonderful, just like Burt Reynolds's performance, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page like King Gator. "Making music together" is probably one of my favorite pieces of any musical movie I've seen. This is certainly a vision for people of all ages.
