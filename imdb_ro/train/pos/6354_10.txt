Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought this would be a bad and childish movie, and that TOTAL was not. it was so incredibly fun to all, adults and children. I saw it once because it was almost out of theaters and now it's FINALLY coming to DVD on this core day and I'm about to be excited as you can see. you should definitely see it if you have not already done it, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
