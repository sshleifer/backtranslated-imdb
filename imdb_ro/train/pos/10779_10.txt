A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. It has an interesting intrigue full of loving characters. Road Rovers is a show worth seeing, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you ever get a chance to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. They would definitely buy me if they did, and if they do, you should buy it too. If you have kids who like dogs, they will love the rovers! Road Rovers should have had more attention while it was broadcast, it was certainly an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
