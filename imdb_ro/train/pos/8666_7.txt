Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranked mobster who returns to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unknown to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level bully who attends a swimming pool and spends Frankie's envy time. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where he forms a link that can not be quite friendship, but it will be done for the time being. This movie came to me under the title "Frank and Tony," which is disappointing because I see an alternate name being "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony," which would have helped sell the movie more effectively . I suppose it's a homage to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I followed her shortly after another Italian crime film, "Violent Professionals," and I have to say that the two complement each other very well. The Italians have always been behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, a real shame with this film. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie, which unfairly unfolds it in a b-film movie (or worse). With sound and a cleaner picture, it could have been a Hollywood hit, I guess. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than the media and unlike the "Violent Professionals", the plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. If you like movies or mafia crime films you should try. A movie about the crowd actually in Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) It's all you can ask. Sure, it's not "the godfather," but it should not be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a movie action movie ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of bad guys. Okay, not really. If not, this movie made me want to check out other films of the director and the main cast. Films besides "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and regular worship movies. What's more fun than finding a lost classic?
