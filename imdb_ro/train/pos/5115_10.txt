I have not seen this movie in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta doing movies? I remember the Oscar show of that year, with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he did not win. How did he dare, when were "true" actors in the running? I'm sorry, John, you should have won. After capturing this film on the cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all done wonderful. I also confess that I never go through when I surf the surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my fingers in the belt and I learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the surveillance, on the soundtrack, of some of the music from Urban Cowboy. "The search for love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics who did NOT join the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........
