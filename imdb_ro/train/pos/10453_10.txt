While traveling by train across Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchman Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The following morning, Jesse returned to the United States, and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, really one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are amazing. The direction is stunning, feels Celine and Jesse feels to the spectator. I just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose "Before sunrise" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I do not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such a scenario, direction and spectacles so magnificent. Yesterday I probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and still love it. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" (Before sunrise)
