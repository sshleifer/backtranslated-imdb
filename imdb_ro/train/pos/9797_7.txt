Batman: The Batwoman Mystery is the latest animated Batman directly to the video / DVD movie to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot spins around a new criminal, Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major shipping. Although the movie is quite exciting, it's not as good as "The Mask of Fantasy," "Sub-zero," or "The Return of the Joker." The main reason is that it does not fully give the emotion the other movies do. At the end of this movie, we are not very sorry for anyone, as we have done in the other, especially "Sub-Zero." There is no real tragedy that made other animated films special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly "rigid" and boring that the viewer does not really care what happened to her that made her put on the mask or what happens to him end and in which there is the main reason we do not receive this particular emotional appeal. Do not get me wrong, I found the movie nice. He has his moments, such as when the audience finds out who is Batwoman and is really an old return that was last seen in "Batman: The Animated Series". The action is also very pleasant, with very suspenseful moments. If the Batwoman background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it is now, it is in the 4th (out of 4). As for animation, it's like the cartoon cartoon The New Batman Adventures from the mid to late 1990s. The score is not as memorable as the other three animated Batman movies, but it's still good. However, I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is nice. But remember, it's not as good as other Batman animated movies. 7/10
