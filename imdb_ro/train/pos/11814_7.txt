Usually, when we use the word "escapist", we mean negatively; The big version of Warren Beatty's screen about "Dick Tracy" proves that the "escapist" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As a titular, double, scary and fearless character, Beatty creates a detective we can relate to: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is just as glamorous as one would expect to be a hubby of any crime fighter; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most astounding person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino, and Kathy Bates are also star. Oh, wait a minute. We did not even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and not succeeding - to find a way to get Big Boy. At the same time, there have been some bizarre events in the city, the answers to which may or may not be closer to anyone who believes. Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty had trouble working his age, then he used this right here. "Dick Tracy" is a great movie.
