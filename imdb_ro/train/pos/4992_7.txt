Generally, I find Loretta Young hard, too worried about her appearance and a lady similar in all the wrong ways. But in Frank Borzage's lyrical story, and even if he plays a low self-esteem, who is facing too much aggression by paramount Spencer Tracy, she is direct, honest and irresistible. It's a strange movie, mostly played in a one-room boat in a Hooverville, unusual in front of the Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing an "ordinary guy" hard to take, who would be a horrible chauvinist and crinkle with today's standards, will soften the difficult edge of his character and make him almost appealing. There is a good support work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who did not get as much as they should), and Jo Swerling's script is modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical, and Young. You want to shed her and tell the character to understand, she's too good for this guy, but she's so shameful and persuasive, you look at their story carefully in a satisfactory conclusion.
