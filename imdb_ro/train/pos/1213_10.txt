This film contradicts the first film as to the origin of caregivers and cousin. I will not deny this. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie then it is a very good movie. I remember looking at this at the beginning of the 80s (and I took part in the demographic audience of the time) and I loved him much more than the first film (not that I did not enjoy that, too, little more than that). Of course it's darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it is also darker in a more subtle way (children do not fully understand, but they may still be a little scared because of the atmosphere they give, and the adults who follow will certainly be faster as they I'm looking at this movie now at the middle of the age of 20), where you actually have a young girl who makes a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for another thing. Take the photo? But simply looking at me like a child, sure, as I said, maybe it was scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if he had given me another fantasy game I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you how many times I used to pretend that the Dark Heart wanted to charge me, help me capture the Bears, try to make me turn back in front of him and other things like that, etc . the movie was also good for my imagination. And she also has deep deep emotion in her. I looked at her at least once a week. Also, Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the Dark Heart's voice (I always thought so I always did). <br /> <br /> Now it's too bad they never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear Listen without watching the movie, as good as it would be. "What good is love and care if she can not save her?"
