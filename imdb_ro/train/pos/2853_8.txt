I finally saw the movie tonight after renting it to Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is very original. Yes, maybe the characters have not been fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. Rather, we are treated to the director's eye, his vision of the story. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want to do it. I think Sabu had to influence the director "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I absolutely loved the way the three women run the beautiful woman on the street to distract them for the moment. I really have to see the other director's work because this film really intrigued me. If you want an understanding, a culture, a fight and a drink, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, the camera movement, and the hunks of the criminals, here.
