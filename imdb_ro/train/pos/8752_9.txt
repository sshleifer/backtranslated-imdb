I've been waiting for such an original picture, like this for some time. Brokedown Palace has that "hard to believe" aspect, but with the ingenious direction and scenario, the Palace is great. <br /> <br /> I never enjoyed seeing Claire Danes in any of her films, but I tell you what really changed my mind with that. Kate Beckinsale joins Danese on a holiday in Thailand where they meet a young man who convinces them to make a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he neglected to inform them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, they are eventually caught and sent to a prison in Thailand. I know, I know, how did you not know you got 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get through that tiny little one, you'll find a very well written story and you'll do it. Lately I have found myself animated in the stories of the films I watch and develop a personal feeling for the characters I'm following. This movie is no different. By the end of the movie, I found myself much more for her than any of the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As usual, Pullman offers excellent performance and beautifully links the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some twists and turns that will have tears to the end of the movie. This is one of those movies you most likely went through when searching for the movie to watch at home. In my opinion, next time at the video store, do not go back to it again.
