when I started watching them became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan hart is very funny and talented, so were the aunt and the other characters and the star of the Salem cat show, he was very funny. the first few seasons, in my opinion, were best if Sabrina was a teenager in high school adaptation to witch life. these were the funniest, the most fun and the most ... good. I have not been a fan since they started to introduce Brad and Dreamer, because I loved Valerie, but it was good that the problem was that they were only in it for one season. if you have new people, keep them at least. I did not like being Josh, he preferred Harvey, but then he disappeared. and have escaped Libby! it would have been great if you quarreled in seven years. and if he and Zelda were married, which would have been gold! then Sabrina moves away from the aunt's house and Roxie / Miles / Morgan's home. I did not like the people in theses, it did not seem like Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff, and her aunts seem to be missing out of her life and her own stupid story lines. I kinda stopped off watching her for a while and the old re-runners came back and I was like cum-hoo! LOL. I have to say that the last seasons were absolutely terrible. They escaped the aunts that sucked because they were a big part of the show. then, suddenly, he lets these two freeloaders move into a beautiful house when treated like dirt. and now works at a magazine store so they stage the famous guest series in the show, if they're in every episode, it ruins it. the program really went down and lost the shine. I've seen the last episode. had her aunts in her (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and is about to get married, but she runs away with Harvey. I would have liked to know what happened afterwards. well that my review and the only thing I can say is the only thing that has remained attractive in seven years was the Salem cat.
