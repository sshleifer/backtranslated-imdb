The title of this film almost left my eyes. He is not a fan of Manchester United, Beckham's just mention was a bit better, though I put my prejudices behind me and I was glad I did. I did not expect too much for a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film hurried to watch my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked the East to be East, then you will love this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new, and the classic stories are contained in the film, but it's all very funny and breathing fresh air. The movie moves very fast and keeps the audience entertained. Occasionally funny moments are a good chic and not a humorous attempt, and especially a good British comedy.
