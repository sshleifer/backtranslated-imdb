Great movie - I liked it. Editing and excellent use of the soundtrack. It captures the real sensation of Indian life, yet we can all relate to it. A well chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so you really care about them and feel you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the football scenes is wonderful, and the direction really works as everyone gets out of it so real and natural. You just can not help but twist for Jess in this movie! The actress was really good, even walking on the ground and the body position of both ladies is very convincing as a person who played a lot of football.
