Not too often, a movie can literally make the audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many movies are trying to do that, but few can bring the emotional impact that this movie made. Adam Sandler basically attracts you through his heated and often violent outbursts, but he also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not pull him down. I will not destroy anything, but there is a particular scene that should have your eyes wet and your lips tremble. Even the most macho men should be heartless bastards not to feel anything while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another extraordinary performance, but he's blackened by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith offer solid performance, but none of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which effectively saved this film from the depression of the border. There is more laughter to say, but you do not think you will stay there long, because it gets serious again without too much warning. We could go further on how well this movie hit on every emotion the human body contains, but I will cut it short. I do not need to tell you anything. Do yourself a favor and take time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it appears on DVD, it is worth 100%. A deep-motion movie that will leave you tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are a heartless soul.
