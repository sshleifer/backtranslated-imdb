The French and those Germans have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that in 1931, Camerdaschaft or Trovesa translated into 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler will assail Germany and begin its plans to take over the world, France being an accident of his ambitions. But these are moments of calm for the future. A group of miners at the border is trying to get to France to get a job. They are refused and later in a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster occurs in the French mines and in a well-prepared and written scene, a German miners' band decides to come to rescue. A simple story is not it? Pabst was a silent movie poet and I'm not sure if this is his first sound or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He is not agitated, but brings a robust realism to the ordeal. It is even a retrospective of a World War II event that highlights the point in this story. It is supposed to be based on a real event, the film makes events proud, directional and terseness. Smetimes, this must be a movie.
