The famous was "renowned" for the tension and release of the cartoon style where the semi-principal character is in terrible distress, only to be saved by the hero in the last second. This Casper is the only one who remembers where death actually has a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy ending. Constanta in Famous Studios is that "virtue always triumphs." Popeye always gets to his spinach in time, Baby Huey always flourishes the fox, Little Audery always "teaches the lesson." And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. You have to give credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I do not think anyone put a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and a brilliant example of the best that the form of art should have provided.
