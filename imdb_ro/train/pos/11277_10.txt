Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some people come to look for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means Tarzan's killing. This is a rarity - a better continuation than the original one. The "Tarzan, Waterman" of 1932 was good, but it had some terrible special effects and a kind of shooting. This has more good effects and is more adult. There are tons of flagrant racism (a black man is shot to death naked - and no one cares), but that was 1934. There is also a lot of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 film ) a long underwater swimming whole nude! There is obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane bear almost nothing and (implicitly) sleep together and have sex - without being married. This would not disturb anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. Besides, the film is well-directed, very fast and full of adventure and enthusiasm. Seeing Weissmuller in that flickering lion cloth is definitely a treatment for the eyes, and Jane's attire is quite revealing. I think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect like Tarzan. Everyone else is okay. This is slightly the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan there. Well worth it, but not for children!
