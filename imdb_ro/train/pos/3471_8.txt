Recently shown on cable television, the film opens with a disclaimer, away from any real-life co-operation; which itself is a catcher eye. However, the scenario and acting from the main characters is superb and I've been worried over time. Not in any way until the clear, interesting and interesting dialogue. The film is about a day-to-day meeting between two real "musical" "legends" that were previously composed together, then separated. The film captures the essence of life and philosophy, in a story that provides an explanation for their initial "division". What is so impressive is that the actors offer such realistic portrayals of the characters they play, malfunctions and all that at least this viewer was left to believe that we are witnessing a real event in almost every detail. The best ability of this game is that with a careful writing and fine action, a movie about "two of us" speaking can make an excellent picture. Worthy of at least 8 out of 10.
