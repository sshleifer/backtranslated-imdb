It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I'm a black comedian. With a play, including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' in London) in the lead, the lines can only help dry. The supporting tower is almost dead. Counting minor flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave her face a washed-out look; there were some noises of Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who had no purpose, and the time of Michael J. Pollard's screen was too short. Everywhere, the cast was unbelievable without the ego to destroy a wonderful screenplay. If you've seen Larry Bishop's movie (writer, director), Underworld (a dark crime film), you'll enjoy it. His next outing (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
