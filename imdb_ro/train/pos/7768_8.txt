This turgid glorious melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at the highest lathe. It avoids soft inheritance "Everything enables Heaven" and sentimentality complained of "imitation of life" and instead turn to blood feverish and overheated blood. And, of course, it's captured in vibrant Technicolor. Cornball story is about a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, who becomes a rivalry when Hudson rejects Lauren Bacall's disease, but who is paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won Oscar for starring in the title role of the actress for a splendid interpretation upside, his sister Stack, leading the family business into their own hands when nobody will. A highlight of the film comes when this wild child with great height hope for dancing frantically in his bedroom, unable to bear the restrictions that gave them the property of the middle class. As happens so often in Sirk, the scene is so indecently hilarious in its absurdity, and yet it moves strangely into its efficiency. Sirk came closer than anyone else to turn the pure camp into high-tech, satisfying high fiestas and eyebrows at the same time in the same films. He was a unique talent and I do not know that there has ever been another film producer quite similar to him since then. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
