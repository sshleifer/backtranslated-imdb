With "Twelve Monkeys," you have to be careful, but if you do, you'll probably find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time travel. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while tied and locked in a room and re-emerging in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe the story to Cole. br /> <br /> The film runs constantly over time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, is taken in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone's just a few seconds after the phone. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you need to keep your attention. You might ask a few questions, but since you can not answer, it is better to agree with the movie. "Twelve monkeys work like science fiction, with some wonderful pictures and a dark atmosphere, and it works like a thriller. You're never sure what's going to happen next and help the movie, maybe it has some flaws in the story, but since it's a fictitious thing like time travel, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy it. That was the easiest part for me.
