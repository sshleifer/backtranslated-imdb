We recorded this movie when it was broadcast on TV in 1995 and we have waited all these years for its release because it has quickly become one of our family preferences. Children are now teenagers and must have seen it several times, but they still follow it religiously with friends. It is appealingly attractive to hang in all age groups - similar to "Grease." Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander delightfully and wonderfully standing. I have noticed that other commentators on this site are pretty harsh for him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We loved his "Giant Step" number.) Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) gives us comedy relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (in the role of Ursula) just steals, steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. The only disappointment was the interpretation of Chynna Philip de Kim. Part of this has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely unidimensional. Complicating that Philip's delivery is flat, inimaginative, incredible and simply terrible. The Director should have seen it and corrected it. Or he never wanted to start. However, in general, the picture is delightful and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
