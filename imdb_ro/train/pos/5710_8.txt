Rene Clair revolutionary music. If you want to see where the songs first led a story, that's the place. This is the story of a young hungry artist who finds that he has won the lottery, just as his creditors are. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his lover's apartment and was given to a convict on the way, which then ... oh, but that would say. This is light and foam (where most people think this has not happened until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's kind of a movie they do not do, and it rarely did when they did it. His sound is a film of the early days that plays as a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in ways that Busby Berkeley did not even do (although it is honest to compare the two filmmakers, it is unfair because Berkeley makes essential numbers and Clair moves the room through the world real "). It's a great movie. and a charming movie that will make you smile. It's just a piece of fluffy joy. I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's all you need to know.
