Although I live in Minnesota, I have studied in France lately and I have come across this bizarre jewel of a movie. This movie was amazing at least. A creative and unique film, the different directors offered something different from their love interpretation in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these stories into an overall story, as can be done with the current love of 2003. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each individual segment overcome. When taken at face value, with each of the short segments taken as their own individual film, love stories together say a beautiful message. The movie is amazingly bizarre from time to time - often to the point of confusion - and every single segment can be hard to follow. However, for an observer who pays particular attention to each segment, short plotting lines become clear after a short time. Confusion is almost intriguing; keep you on the edge of the chair and wait for the next. It lets the spectator wonder, "Is that really what happened?" yet they leave them satisfied with the fact that it really did. It is a kind of film in which the viewer, when he leaves the theater, can not decide whether he loves or hates him. The initial reaction is to go and look again and again, just to see these individual lives mingle together in a cinematic masterpiece. The exciting decision to make the multilingual film adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate. Adds the reality of the movie - here American tourists speak English, French Parisians and so on. The number of people the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love. From disease to supernatural, love of parents to the love of spouses, this film covers all the basics romantic stories. In its beautiful and strange way, every single event enters in a way in a way, to tell a story: that of all types, dimensions, nationalities and the form of love.
