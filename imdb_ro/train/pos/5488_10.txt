A case of being in the right place at the right time. What fascinating film. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He did the things. It is accessible. And it's also easy to see why the West hates it so much. He has control over the resources of his country and gives people's profits. Most of the poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can interpret misleading images to put the case there. Just like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or those lacking WMD. Or about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo-consuls who govern the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom from Fascism. It's not the problem of people in America. It's the government.
