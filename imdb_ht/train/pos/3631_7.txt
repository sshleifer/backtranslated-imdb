The movie actually has a fairly good story, but gets bogged down to several key places. It's almost as if the director cast the film together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the movie. Dennis Quaid has done a decent decent job in his role ... but something is lacking in several key performances. And probably there would be a better movie it was not felt as if it had been thrown together. <br /> <br />
