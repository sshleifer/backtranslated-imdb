As one of the previous comments said, this had the foundations of a big movie but something happened on the road of delivery. Such a garbage because Collette's performance was weird and Williams was credible. I just keep waiting to get better. I do not think it was bad correction or needed another director, he could just be the movie. He came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needs a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump on your chair. The film arrived at this time faded; Kinds like a Few point. I can see how excessive suspense would have taken away the "reality" of the story but I thought that part happened when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to cut a Director who tries to fix these issues.
