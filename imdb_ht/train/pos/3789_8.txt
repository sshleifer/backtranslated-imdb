Bravo's Czech, a once-powerful movie industry seems to wake up from post-Communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners are a comedy make and all the elements you'd expect to see in a modern "hollywood" less garbage production that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years. Superb soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague village, mentioned a few. The story is actually composed of several sub-stories that are often intertwined and overlapping, one in the sense of a collage of destinations, gods, desires ... It follows a group of young-to-mid-thirty men among a variety of situations from daily life and recreational activities in careers and obsessions. And it is hillarious. There is actually a point in the movie where the entire theater I was in (about a hundred people in a small art gallery) laughing that does not stop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience this with modern Hollywood production? Although all of the main cast is excellent (mostly in the coming of Macedonia star Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all-too-familiar difficulties) I have one out Jury Machacek for his superbly slippery painting in Jakub, a reckless reckless injured with brain that affects many of the stuff he smoked landing in a multitude of unusual situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss this one! He received a lot to offer.
