Butch the peacemaker? Obviously. After violent and spooky start, Tom and Jerry all swing away at each other, Butch calls a halt and wants to know why. It's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, can not they?" he asked Tom, who nods himself in agreement. "Mouse can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no," and then see this is not the right answer. <br /> They go inside with Butch draw up a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, three of them were very nice to each other What a refreshing two-speed change. I found it fun to look. I can be a million of these cartoons in which each beat each other on the top. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew the peace would not last. A great piece of spell death of the death of "treating the peace" but en route was beautiful change and always had some of the usual Tom & Jerry smart humor.
