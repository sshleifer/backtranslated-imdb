I saw this film twice or more and found it well done! WWII was freshly finished and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. This film could be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic Americans cinema and, secondly, those who are still forming "Western NATO blocks" in their country face the next threat. The film celebrated the power of the U.S., in the centuries, while predicting himself the Winter War currently present, which just ended. Nice and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the beautiful "episode" in New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a local Indian drink .. You must see it (at least once, for the curiosity mode of propaganda in time)! :)
