Ensure it may not be a classic but it's one full of classic lines. One of the few movies my friends and I quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later (Perhaps it was about Cinemax once too much!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he Can not seem to figure out how to play it - but it was surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this parody. Looking for a movie to apply? This is it but rent it with friends - it will make it even better.
