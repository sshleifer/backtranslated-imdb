Brando plays the ace jet pilot, just returned from shooting MiGs down to the Korean War. On leave, she discovered her Madam Butterfly, fell in love. Lovers are both seeing the frenzy of racism and the cruelty that cultural conservative norms can bring into human relationships. This movie is an excellent romance with a beautiful twist that rejects the racists, conservative standards, ruling in his time in 1957. "Sayonara" will make you laugh and cry.
