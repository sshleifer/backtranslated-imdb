The movie is just plain fun .... maybe more fun for those of you who were young and fond of the "Ramones" at the time the movie was made. I watched the movie over and over, not myself and friends, and it's always cool and funny. At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school boredom students and drudgery in some classes are just as timeless. <br /> And the movie has some host / scene lines ..... references to how our "permanent records" in high school will follow us in life. (Let me assure you I've come from high school for, uhhh, a few years and it does not follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I'm getting some static" ..... " Not as much as you're going to get ", as Director of Togar approaches) ..... members of school board who are so decades he went to by nurses ... The Nazi Hall Monitors love for a" body search ". .... Director Torah announces, "I give you the final solution", and burn the Ramones records (note: the files were preceded by the CD) .... and of course Joey Ramone anything, "Sure thing has changed since we got kicked out of high school ", followed by Togar asking" Did your parents know you're Ramones? "<br /> Just one piece of advice ..... do not look up where the stars now ..... Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was a bigger hottie in the movie, today reminds us of all ages .... PJ Sole Career has never advanced as we can expect ......... Marla Rosenfield, as One other student, Apparently appeared only in this movie (one of my friends dying on it every time we watch the movie), even though I submit his performance was more than adequate and should have been carrying film roles its more young ones. And, anyone who knows what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> So look and enjoy ..... do not think .... just have fun!
