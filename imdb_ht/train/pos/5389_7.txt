Signs like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natural parish (and one to be difficult at that), the rapid moving programmer has an emotional impact of satisfaction - especially because Eric Linden, like the unpleasant young husband In the main draw, so palpable a wreck, and good reason. Her hope, Loretta Young, was brought to the parish at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for a lecher that probably came to her; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to empathize audience, and it is a bit too good for them to be true, though sympathetic and beautiful looking at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls in the ward form the heart of the movie, and the result - not one everyone happy - feels right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the actresses of the perfect movie," in the films of filmmakers David Thomson, heat exposure and authority as the top nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a non-too-new mother of twin, becomes croon " Frankie and Johnny "as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more rows than Warners usually allow him. It's proportional to modest rhythm, and hopeful Linden's father panic stay with you for days - this sort of party has often played for laugh, but it's a young kid afraid of trouble, and very compelling.
