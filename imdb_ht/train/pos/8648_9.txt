California is an ideal movie about losing. A journey on the darker road ever. Roads never returned. The plot is about a couple who set out to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role up to now) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened to America and his girl - who is a photographer - who will take pictures. So they set out on a trail of famous murderers do not know what awaits them on the road. They share the travel costs they decide to find another couple and put an ad. But the couple who answered it is not just any couple. She is one of the strange brides ever. The girl is a naive, fragile creature that dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A wicked cruel murderer. We learn that early in the movie and we follow him on the trip to California (not with C as usual but with K, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey to betrayal, murder and ultimately defeat. All the guys, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give really good performance, and you should take into consideration that when this film was filmed by none of them was a star. The photography is amazing, with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie, and the music suit the dark character of the movie. On the whole is a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before taking some strangers from your car to share the fuel with!
