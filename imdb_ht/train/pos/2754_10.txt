I really liked this movie, saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great direct / camera-work / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. Too bad duckael van deer did not make more movies after this one. Top 5 jobs. Really !! <br /> Today, it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above. it has never been posted because it was not over 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is no doubt in my top 3 movie along with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I'm really curious about the "new yummy movie from the dormael". I hope he will fill my movie head 3. If you see this film, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you will want to see it again.
