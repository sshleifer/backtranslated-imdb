'Cry Liberty' is a movie about how far people will find the truth. The first half is an interesting portrayal of an easy friendship between Steve Biko activist and Don Woods editor (played by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods are looking for answers to Biko's death. Although most people favor the first half of the film focusing on the friendship easily between Biko and Woods'. I found the second half of Don Woods struggles to have Biko's story to be heard in the world much more interesting.
