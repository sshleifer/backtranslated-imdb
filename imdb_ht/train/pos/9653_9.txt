First Love is a desperately difficult subject to convincing in the movie: all-impatient passion involving usually ends as a mischievous emperor or, worse, a little ridiculous. Lifshitz managed to avoid all the inconveniences and deliver a moving, sexy, hungry, and loving story of love, disaster and redemption possible, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes human existence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! As the summer warms up, they fall in love, and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. A year later, the disaster-related relationship: Cédric cheats on Mathieu who, distressing, trying to take his own life. He continued to live with him, in order to gain perspective back on his life and returning to the seaside town where they met first, this time cloaked in the winter cold. <br /> If the story was said to be like this, it would never have the impact it does: many of it is implicit, all this happens that is not the sequence. <br /> <br /> The complicated narrative is essential to getting a deeper sense of passionate experience, by using counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, three time-lane uses (the summer of love, post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are color coded: yellow hot and orange for the summer, an almost frillingly cold blue for the hospital scene and warming and blues plan for seawater. <br /> Both main actors put in excellent performance though, also it's a pleasure to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used in his full fitness (I'm more used to seeing him down -Whether in Draghem instead of Gaelel Gaelel The Morel), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) had to be targeted for special mention: you can feel her loneliness, then her almost incredulous passion, then her character drooping behind a wall of aphasia. Very well-fabricated gestures get through more than dialogue ever could. The terms touching on are almost classic in French movies: our difficulty really understands that another feeling; Our struggles to communicate completely; the seeds shifting to meaning ?? The title of the movie "Presque Rien" (Almost anything) points to those and, indeed, in one of the key scenes of the movie: In trying to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, a psychiatrist asked Cédric if he never cheated on it? "There is nothing, but once, but that's not going to Rien" (No, well, yes, once, but it was nothing). Cédric always loves Mathieu ?? He took him to the hospital during suicide attempts (none of which we see) and tried to desperately contact him once he left ?? but he can not understand that he has lost it forever, because something that seems nothing to him (a sense of meaning) is Mathieu's everything. The movie is darker than the unfortunate Pierre and Gilles poster would suggest, it is not hopeless: we get to slow down Cédric's, painful attempts to get in touch with life, first of a her cat adopted, then worked at a local bar and finally contacted Pierre, who could love her next. But here's the story ending: A young passion, over of the year, another maybe starting. So what was it? Almost anything? Certainly not when you live it ??
