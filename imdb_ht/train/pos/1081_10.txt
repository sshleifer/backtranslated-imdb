One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical movie, a precautionary guide to a new home. <br /> <br /> Full and great characters all, Cary Grant is convinced, they come out to fly him to the building in a dream home. br> <br /> A great look at life in late 40's. <br /> <br />
