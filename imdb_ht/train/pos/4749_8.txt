I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little hard to do that when your brother commenting stupidly in her ever 30 seconds. But this movie I enjoyed, mostly because I used the usual film movie HK. Most of these films like this do not look it for the story line, look it for the mindless action. And stupid action is right. You get to see Jet He Jump, turn, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge bullets untold. It is true that this film was released at a wider audience after He was in Lethal 4. Guns are one of the reasons why the ratings on this movie are falling. Most people were probably hoping to see a film that was as polished as a North American film. But you need to remember most HK film budgets are not nearly as high as American film films, and the style of a HK film action usually quite different is usually required in wireless work in a lot of them. If you want to see a good action movie you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing. My Rating Rating 8.
