The number of black and white photographs, and many of them, emphasized this supposedly-true life of a murder in 1950 in Kansas in which a whole family was wiped out by two men. Written by Truman Capote, so you get the very liberal anti-death message at the end of the movie, which is funny to know the facts in this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two arteries that have twisted outlook on life and that unnecessarily murder this family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying slant in the end, this is a fixed story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating. Famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on that. It made me want more modern-day movies they made in black-and-white. Watch it on DVD. Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and cast all of their support are excellent in here. The third look of this film arrived early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, pronounced innocent of the murder trial of his wife. One can not help but look at Blake and this movie differently afterwards.
