Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of murdering his wife. That night he was assassinated by a woman who had refused to give her a name. After accusing the murder, police visited wherever he was, but the people only remember he was alone. He was sentenced to death by his secretary (Ella Raines) lying out to find the murderer himself because he loved her. This was done as a B movie from universal (see cast all actor characters and one star - Franchot Ton - on the decline). The budget was small and the cast was mostly unknown, but this was one of the best films in the 1940s. It is well-directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script from an excellent book by William Irish (a Corner Woolrich pen name). It moves quickly and just looks fantastic. After that, the saddest jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. which just came on the screen with incredible sexual energy (I wonder wonderless they did not cut it). <br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect. Tone gives an obnoxious performance. It looks horrible and it's just awful. Also Curtis is stiff and bland as Henderson. You really wonder why rain loves it - it's so unemotional. But rain is very good in the lead role. It is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene when the murderer is after it's never true ring. It is hardly a physical threat and its reaction just looks exaggerated. <br /> Still I give this a 9. A really big movie - flaws aside.
