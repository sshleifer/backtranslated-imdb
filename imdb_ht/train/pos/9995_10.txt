This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on, and your feet up. It does not require much brain-power to follow, so very good after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you are waiting for anything serious, then do not bother, but it is very funny. Just thought that a businessman would go too far to agree to live in a temporary slum, and then actually get to enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
