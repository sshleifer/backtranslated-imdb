Why Did not Dynamo Have Any Pants? Where did they go ?? He never explained. That's why this movie was so scary. Plus Starsky gave the children the AIDS !!!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserves to win best supporting actors! An I D S my favorite line from the film was "That Hit The Place" A I D S. This movie was for the "Birds". I tried to give this film "the stinkeye" but it continues to play. What I do wrong ??? !!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like that for a show. Why was not Dynamo wear pants. I know his arms were skewered but ... What's up with these crazy veins. Why did not that family guy Ray Combs get a net ?? He could use one. AIDSSSSS
