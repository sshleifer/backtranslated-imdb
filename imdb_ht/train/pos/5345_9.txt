Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain that will go toward political confrontation again. That's why this leader should show at all Spanish high schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the crime of hiding in fascism. The American pilot who gets involved in the Hispanic Civil War is selected for the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is amazingly well illustrated in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent. Violence in a War (could anyone tell me the difference between any war and a civil war?) Used as a storyline in hope when two young people express their feelings and protect each other. Crucifixes that begin to abuse the same powers for innocent children are now active again. A movie like 'Via Carol' / Carol 'says one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could have. Again the great work of the Iberica peninsula!
