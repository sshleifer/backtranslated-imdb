First of all, the film is an ingenious work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a kid pretended to be a legacy grown to grow a million dollars and how it spends it. I mean how loaded out is this. Walt Disney really outdid themselves this time. The comedy is most of the times expected but the unexpected times. I mean this movie was OK or was this movie OK. She also taught so much about wise young people and this kid is really wise and a little smart pants. But it also absorbs. How the heck could be a guy like the kid to get a hot police babe and his father let him go free. This is like leaving an assassin get bailed free for ten years. If I did what I would get beaten with a 'Jack suble' (a big stick sting when using your mothers really hard). That kid is really lucky. Return to the story. The movie makers really knew what they were doing when doing this movie but still it was not perfect. The act was good and bad. The kid and woman had no chemistry nor did the father but the bros were excellent '. The special effects of the other hand were lame. This film is not based on reality. I was hated and I loved it at the same time.
