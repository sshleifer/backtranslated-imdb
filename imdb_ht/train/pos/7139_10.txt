Jan Thaw, of Inspector Morse fame, playing old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village during 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War. A bit of a solitaire, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving during the First World War. If you can imagine Morse Inspector Old and Retired, twice as crochety as when he was a policeman, then you had the character Tom Oakley. But the heart of flint is about to dissolve. London children are evacuated in advance of the Blitz. Young William (Willie) Beech is billeted and Tom is protesting. Willie has played good effect by Nick Robinson. This boy is in need of care and a capital C. Behind the school, always leaking the bed, and his ability to be the smallest of his problems. It comes from a terrible background in London, with a mother who can not cope, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly, but gradually, man and boy warm each other. Tom discovered again his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. Watch Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of the gardens. See Willie's delight at what's probably the first part of her birthday to throw away by tom. <br /> <br /> Do not give away the finish, but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle, and the fear begins a very rich life for their mutual love. <br /> In this movie, Thaw and Robinson are following in a long line of movies where people meet boys and develop a mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in the "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti's "He Begins In Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captain Courage". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face". <br /> Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of Thaw that I know in where he sings. Only one verse in a hymn, New Jerusalem, but it sings. <br /> Second, Robinson's youth also starred in a second film featuring "Tom" in the title, "Tom's Midnight Garden", based on a classic child's novel.
