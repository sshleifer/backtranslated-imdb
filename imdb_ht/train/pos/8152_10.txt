I just read the most recent remarks on this movie and I would like to respond. you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning of 1988, in 1989 cube ice left the band going solo and finally in 1991, the band broke when Drdre left. which led to a lot of beef began with the departure of ice cubes and dr.dre in 1991. This story was a bit based on that. The more this film was a minute 90 laughs, the road explained the bootie juice song for a political statement was hilarious. Not to mention the "love song" tasty snack was up. and when Vanilla Sherher got her ass chase, just like the executive company records is also hilarious and having administrators are getting bullets every time too. <br /> <br /> People who did not enjoy this movie probably did not find it or were complete idiots, my opinion
