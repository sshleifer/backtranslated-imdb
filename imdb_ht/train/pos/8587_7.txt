Take Me: Make use of its familiar plot and fine performance with a few genuine moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is unusual. An innocent man framed for a plot to murder US President, the first treacherous US Secret Service. As his fellow secretary-service pursues him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know his innocence, and the real guilt is just around the corner, but I was always entertained by the sentinel. At the moment where the stairs are reduced to being too funny and too luxurious in the action section, the Sensual is a good lick-back of all those good old-fashioned thriller political crimes. The familiar plot is elevated by its own typing and terrific performance. Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is long-running secret service Agent Pete Garrison, who framed for being part of a plot to murder the President. Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) pursue Harrison while trying to find out who is behind the possible assassination and betrayal of the Secret Service. This led to a lot of chasing scenes that, surprisingly (and fortunately), are never incredible. The scripts also offer a subplot involving Garrison who has an affair with Lady First (played by Kim Basinger). This fortunately was not necessary as most subplots are these types of films. <br /> <br /> The movie director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.) who managed to make the movie look good. Although many criticized it as "should have a movie movie," I must agree. Granted, this is not a perfect movie, and many of it is inspired by clever other actions and intrigues such as in the line of fire or an episode from the 24 TV series (that film is quite similar to when it comes to style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film takes its plot into serious heights and does not abandon even its smallest details. Their performance is terrific (with a top-notch cast, tied it to be, even with the no-number script. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, my awards *** 1/2 , not perfect but not far from it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
