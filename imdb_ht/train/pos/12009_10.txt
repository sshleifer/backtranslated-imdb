I really thought they had done an excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with it all, I do not know how the first commenter could say it was awful, he moved me into tears (I guess he moved on everyone with tears) but I tried not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing, but this one got me. It was SOOO good! I hope to release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel like it renews my faith and gives me a hope that I can not explain, and has made me want to strive to be a better person, they have gone through a lot and we are the kind of take that to be granted , I guess. Compared to that, I feel like our own trials have nothing. Well, nothing, but they hardly match what they went through. I loved it. Who played Emma?
