Samo takes on the lei care karts in a casino, the loser loses battle, but what a battle he filled with temple actions and elements of comedy dropping in. .. some great moments and touches in the movie, Lam Ching Ying pops up in a cannon and gets cut off - troubled. <br /> <br /> The sequel sequel will have you reach for the restored button, as its one of the best end battles I've seen. Samo takes on loads of men and ends up square up to Billy Chow.
