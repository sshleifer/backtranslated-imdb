A Great British Indian Movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters makes for some hilarious drug-powered pieces that Cheech and Chong should be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (though he was swapping since Quadrophenya!) And Gary Stretch is amazingly good and a treat for the ladies! Wanted the final battle scene and shake it in Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on Fire on the Top of the Pops ... he does not act .... he really is a good Hippie British Press You do not have to have a biker to enjoy this and it's right on Friday night post-pub to repeat the collection's look. <br /> <br /> Give this movie away and you will not be disappointed.
