Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, South Seza, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny movie, funny. Fred Gwynne late is really wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and her son and daughter. South Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum with a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When Herman and Dad's face began to terrorize everyone in the city's blame. The two have clear names before it's too late. You'll laugh as loud as I did.
