For all the enemies out there: condemning a TV set and one episode is like judging a book all the first few pages. That being said, I was a big fan of BSG, thought it was some of the best TV dramas (not just sci-fi) in the air. But it was time for her to end with the story to move on. I liked BSIL to swim "The Plan," but she raised as many new questions as she replied, so I hastily anticipated "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> I was hoping he would not try to have another BSG, and I was happy that "Caprica" ​​is something different, and I personally found the story interesting, in a different way than battle lit up, explosions and special special effects (do not get wrong, I love this too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales provide solid performances, and Alessandra was just wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
