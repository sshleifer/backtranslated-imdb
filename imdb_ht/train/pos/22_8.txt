If you fast forward in the terrible song, you will find a classic fairy tale under. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good in the role. Its trademark style of acting works well for the chic carriage of Boots. Other actors are well for parties. I did not find any of the acts terribly false or awkward. The King in particular looks a real real though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fraudulent as some of the cost fare computer that we see today. In general, I recommend this movie for kids and adults who are a child at heart.
