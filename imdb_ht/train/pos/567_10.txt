Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann associate some of the best western ever to make and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the movie however is the Canadian Spectacular Rockies that serves as a series of stories. Some of the best movies ever do in the story of films. In all five of the West, Stewart and Mann have joined the roles they supported were perfectly cast. There are no exceptions here, right down to parts that could only be a few lines, the characters are firmly engraved with these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical hard-bitten solar in this movie whose only true friend is Sidekick Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death in the hands of the bandits who make him want to finally free the golden settlement of the bad guys and incidentally to redeem himself in the process. John McIntire is the top cruel at the piece and he was an actor who does not appreciate a vast series. He could play delightful old codgers, figures of authority and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain. <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
