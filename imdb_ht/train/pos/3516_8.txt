Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over-the-top (but she played similar in other films such as "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the film certainly "thrilled". <Br /> <br /> * detailing too before *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was harassed in her movie but I seem to remember several other examples. I will refrain from naming the killer, but I think it is necessarily obvious because of the "gambling" demands of the demands. A very well-faded movie no-fated (for example, everyone smoking such as crazy and police were real stock characters. And no dead bodies have ever been shown, unlike today's Gore newspaper.) Made in the short format formats -then table of the period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
