This motion picture has a rhythm, haunt, backed up with great acting (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that reveals us over time. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, the music fully establishes the mood and supports in keeping a comfortable, cautious and tone tonal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> Although they are related to history as well as genre, this holds the same feeling of my as the "Tour of the Sky" Ursula Le Guin (1980). <br /> <br /> The "Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some momentous moments. Remember, "Hacking and Slicing" does not make a film of a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and twitching that rests in us all.
