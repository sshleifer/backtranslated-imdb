Another unique talent example of Cary Grant. A performance that deserves Oscar's consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy. Mr. Grant runs the gamut from comic sensitive to this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move from the big city. The pitfalls of building a house are quite chronically and it became the base (wound) for the most modern Tom Hanks machine, "The Money Grow" .. If you like good old fashioned comedy without the curse and free sex, this movie is a must see.
