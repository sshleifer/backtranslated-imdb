All the dogs going to heaven are a movie that I still love. When I was a kid, I used to watch this every other day. It is maladora if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie like many say, it is a very good movie. This is good and your kids will probably love it. Even if it rated G, some parents can get this to be a bit violent. It is actually a very dark story, where dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold bloodshed. The movie follows a dog named Charlie who escaped from the book, who died by his old friend, went to heaven, but ended up coming to earth. Many younger children watching this movie can feel as though they are watching a big kids movie. <br /> There are some scenes that can scare young children, but I'm sure they will be fine. Every time I watch this movie, she reminds me of when I was a kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of being smaller, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. Their performance from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the latest film that a girl named Judith Barsi was in. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she was very potential and did not deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can not watch this movie again because her voice sounds sad. <br /> <br /> The animation of this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is a good thing, but somewhat different from many other kids movies. This was popular at the time of its release, but it was on the shadow by Mega Disney's the Little Mermaid. This is a movie that does not conceive as well by adults, but if you are a kid, or if you have grown up with this movie as a kid, then I'm sure you'll enjoy watching li.
