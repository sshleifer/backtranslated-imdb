What do you get if you cross the Matrix and the Truman show? <br /> I'm sure you've seen all the Matrix by now. The creators of the Matrix say it is 'animated inspiration'. Just to look at this classic trailer, you can see where the draw was drawn from. The movie is sort of set in the 1980s Japan, and it really shows. The costumes, music and words (in recent versions of English versions by AD Vision) are all as they were directly raised from the era. I believe he did at that time too, but due to certain draw points, that's not the movie date! <br /> As you probably guessed by my reference to the Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really in the 1980s. In fact, it's something more like the 2480. After a nuclear war, Earth's ecosystem (or "Biosphere First Ecosystem") was destroyed. Survivors we are forced to escape from space, where the conflict continues. Once the planets (or "Biospheres") were all abandoned, people began to live in MegaZones - city vessels, where, through hypnotism techniques and Truman Show-esque illusions, they were convinced that we are back earth, the most peaceful times of recent memories ... the 1980s. When young Shogo finds an advanced motorcycle motorcycle, he brought him more than he was supposed to know ... The Garland (a bike that became a mech), a weapon from the 2400, shogo help to escape him in the military pursuit. As more and more are discovered on the MegaZone, the war comes closer to home, due to conflict between the military and the computer, the war comes in the megaZone too ... I regret if these points are seen as crowds, but drawn to basically describe this way about the Summary. <br /> <br /> Emotions run high in this movie, moreso than the Matrix. You really believe the war will pass, and Shogo really gets scarred by what it's discovered. What starts as a 80's uber-happy 80's reputation becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the decomposition of cartons we've seen flipping around in the bullet-time of the Matrix. There is really the essence of the suffering people can go after being caught in such a plot, with a war. It may just choke you towards the end ... I know she's done me. <br /> <br /> Animation is very impressive for its day, and the quality picture on the DVD consonance is incredible for its age. The Artwork Art is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional, very cultural animation. Prepare for quite a lot of violence and blood, there's also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The end can be seen as a 'can be no end', as with the Matrix, or, supposedly You must follow the end, which I have not yet had the pleasure to watch . <br /> I must say that this is one of the best animated I've seen, in fact, one of the best movies I've seen, and considered by many to be one of the greatest animated them at all times. <br /> I must recommend the concise DVD, as taken on the English language is incredible and make the movie fair, and can be purchased with a workshop to keep the end up when released, which will be even cast in vocal . <br /> At all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie, and worthy to be held very, and should be an essential part of any of the animated fans' collection. Heck, even my mother loved it.
