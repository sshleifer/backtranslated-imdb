Vizconti's first movie has its full visual flair and visual arts, accompanied by convincing performances from Massimo Girotti as the beautiful drifter and, most of all, Clara Calamai as Fabulous, Giovanna's frantic. Remade several times as the 'Postman ring twice' but never improved. Can not believe this was the first man's movie! It shows confidence in someone in the zenith of their careers.
