Lee Lee likes to love ease into a movie, catching action, characters and surroundings on the stomach, as they exit. Covering the haphazard endgame into the U.S. civil war through the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed to yourself manhood, this is an ideal approach. The movie turns out to be the formation of personality, adult and relationship. Lee also shows beautiful scenery among the south as a silent character, enduring the conflict as a tough parent. James Schamus' script <br /> is probably bringing to the standard for this movie; Locked behind it is a number of well-appointed performance that brings it admirable. Jeffrey Wright's name alone could bring this movie to me. It's brilliant here but in a slower role to burn: rather we treat very good (if not revelatory) performance from a large, often recognized ensemble. A noble, optimistic film. One look if you are not fancy the harder, more cold mountain emblem or the Claim, for example. 7/10
