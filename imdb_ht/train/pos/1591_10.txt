My mom and I just recently became addicted to this show, laughing to our medical care! I only saw about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointing that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before being canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters really have great personality (or, not so great, but still funny!). I TiVO every episode of what I love about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all the cast, never let me bored while watching! There are some languages ​​suitable for children and some sexual content, but with a parent guidance near, you should not have too much trouble. Some kind of 'Friends' kind of relationships that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
