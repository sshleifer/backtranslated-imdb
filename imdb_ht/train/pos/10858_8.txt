Enjoying the film and effective compromise crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a vicious young man, no doubt representing modern society. I thought the final scene was weird and could not understand if we believed that the great D were punished for being vicious or was part of the plan a while. I liked the scene and once in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a martial arts martial arts. On things that still amusing me on HK film is that the British main influence seems to have been featuring 'yes wi' and 'sorry' in the local language and its funs long since we go, they are still there .
