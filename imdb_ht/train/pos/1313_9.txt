More television cinema should be made like this one. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrific, giving extremely courageous and realistic performance. Weber was especially good, turning into an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as a child of molesty / killer. This film really increases my respect for hunting as an actress. The director also ruled "Hoosiers," which was somehow both formula and interesting. But the direction both of these works have the same strong, realistic realism that is so appealing. If you love TV movies that are not predictable and full of overacting, see if you can. The history of Hunt Hunt and Fahey is also appealing without dismaying of the main story.
