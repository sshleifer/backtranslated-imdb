Consider all the teen movies such as the "Breakfast Club" and "Pretty in Pink" that are lyonised. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. <br /> There is no sex in it, but the sex is thought, including the idea that it may have problems that others think about it. Children do not always get along with parents, but neither parents nor children are seen as good or bad, and parents do not see it as monsters. <br /> It deals with hero-worship. How a girl does something dangerous, which might have lead to real dust, before realized that it was wrong. The movie is kind of ahead of its' time. A kid asks another kid to control his birth. He says he does not do anything that needs control. He responds (wrongly) "oral sex".
