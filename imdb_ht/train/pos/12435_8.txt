I was happy to see she had black hair! I was a fan of about 30 years now and were lousy of the two tenth stories of their stories. <br /> I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer, do not spoil it all. In fact I watched the movie twice in one day, a sign if it was up to standard. This is what I do with books that I love too. <br /> I think all characters are well shown and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise very well as the corners of both books and comic strips. I should also agree with a comment made by an earlier review of the villain who has to be ugly. Is it actually read the books? <br /> I think this was a very good movie and look forward to ending with anticipation.
