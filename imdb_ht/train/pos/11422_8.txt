Denis Claire's chocolates are a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the home of a colonial European family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interactions. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, a central theme of the story is France's young anxiety to form strong relationships with others. Although this painting is executed optimally, notably in the way Denis confers the story and scene from France's return to his childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy and other movie characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in development it (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The overall esteem of film character's development makes it difficult to become engaged in the scheme organized organizing. The movie raises a strong tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in his life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer satisfied. The final scenes are powerful, but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical way, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best option.
