I saw this film yesterday about Turner, and I could stop watching until it was over, even if I sort of guess what would happen. Farrell was great in his role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of it seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, I loved it !! If you get the chance to see it, please do! I actually call in a few scenes, but then I guess if you're a mom you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just surprised at the very idea of ​​being unwed mother, she looked ahead of her 'time. I say, WATCH IT if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laugh, I cry out loud! I enjoy it!
