From what critics and audience indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a large clerk of sandstone. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It proved worthy to look. Sure, it's not your American American comedy, and it does not take a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I love it. It was a change in all the movies around the world, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were some traps, but overall it worked. The first, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very celebrated, but still quite sexy role. It just keeps proving it is one of the top talents in Hollywood. It's not just Russian accent when it speaks English efficient, but there are times when it comes to long conversations in Russian and if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should take note of "K-19." Overall a little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.
