Michelle Rodriguez is actress defining who would be the force to complain about other actresses to look out for. He has the audacity to put himself in a rarely hard-girl role very early in his career (and pull it off), which is a feat that should be recognized. Although film later she pigeons for the same role, this film has made her flexibility. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover, struggling to overcome his existence in the projects, which is a little too much of film ... but not by a girl . This aspect of this movie is not very original, but the story goes in depth when the warmhearted relationships that this girl has to deal with comes in a mud and primal rage she takes on. <br /> I do not see an actress taking such an aggressive position in film-making again, and I'm glad she was getting that original twist out there in Hollywood. This movie has got a 7 in me because of the average story of gene ghetto, but it has such a great actress scarcely rarely seen in a minimal budget film. Great job.
