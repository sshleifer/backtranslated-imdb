Greet again from the darkness. One of this will be compared to the "Princess Bride" and although it does not measure up to that classic, it's very fun and well done in its own right. The story line is somewhat odd and the whole wall thing never really explains, but the execution is fine, even built strong suspension. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the evil girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to seek him a falling star ... that's going to be played by Danes they are stunning Claire. Not much suspense about what is happening with these two, but the thriller part comes in with the cruel witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the King King Peter O'Toole claiming the necklace "Our Star" Ruby. Many bad people chase the good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, a meeting with the strange ship you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard on the inside, and we have to say in touch with her feminine side. Another encounter involves Ricky Gervais's brilliant as a fast-paced trader and good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> It's not typical chasing you, coming in age, or fantasy movie, but Matthew Vaughn's director ("Layer Cake") effort deserves a hearing. Unfortunately the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. I guess he'll get great success on video.
