This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows a China I've never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows China's 1930s in the most real light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heart-breaking in many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the finish are incredibly happy. You really see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. Actors are all perfect, as you feel like you really go into a different world. I simply can not recommend this movie pretty much. It can just change you forever once you've seen it.
