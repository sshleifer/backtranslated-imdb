This is a musical adaptation of the Dicken "Oliver Twist". For the most part, the original story was kept, though for the film flow of certain subplots (like the summer it was retired and the half-brother) omitted. The biggest difference in the film and the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanging - a very different finish from this musical film. This is a one of a kind of music - one that has style and dimensions really has not been matched before or since. Not only are the songs often quite remarkable and memorable, but choreography in the movie is a sight seeing. While in most musical a few people or perhaps even a small group of choreographers dancing, here numbers are often run in the hundreds or maybe more. It is really a sight to see and I was fortunate enough to see it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my first memories. Having just seen it again a moment ago, I should say that the movie only got better over time. Great together, wonderful and singing - this is a special treat that is difficult not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was amazed by just how high and feminine Mark Lester was singing for the movie. Well, according to IMDb, it was singing he was armed by a girl and this would definitely be for his voice.
