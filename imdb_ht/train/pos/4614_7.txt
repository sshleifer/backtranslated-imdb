This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this piece of "Pleasurable Pleasure". It's easy to condemn this movie for not including Pat Patty and Butch Patrick, originally Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and make the math. Dotty priests and Butch Patrick had lots of time releasing their party! Time to do this young star. Yvonne De Carlo, who re-prized her role as Lili, pushed the Big 6-0 (though she always looked good and was still perfect "Lili"). <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo was not given a bigger part. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the role that they were so famous! During the 2 seasons that MUNSTERS were in prime time, it was the Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made these series a success. The rest of the cast supported members cast, they did not say they did not need. They were! The TV series would not survive as long as it did. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice on Joan Marshall. Even though this movie does not measure up to the original TV series, it is still fair and it is one of the best "Reunin" TV specialties that suffered boob-tube during the early 1970's / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
