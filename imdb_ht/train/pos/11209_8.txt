Buddy is a fun family movie set in a time when "humanizing" the animals and making them beautifully a way to get people to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy beloved shows that the main characters are for animals and for each other, and that they will do nothing for each other. <br /> While not a perfect movie, animated gorilla is quite lively most of the time and the destruction of the house is usually fun for kids. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks an opportunity to address the mistake of carrying wild beasts in the home as pets, but displaying difficulties. A movie that was the first to Jim Henson Productions.
