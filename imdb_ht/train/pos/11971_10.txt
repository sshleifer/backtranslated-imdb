I think the comments regarding the show being cheeses a bit too exaggerated. When someone comes to watch a TV show, what does he look out for? He is enjoying watching a show, unless he / she is a critic or someone who analyzes stories. But many of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to look after a heavy day at the school / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any of these families exist in real world, it would be a model for us to follow. But this is a TV show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong in describing a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show was able to run long to show us that people loved to watch it, regardless of what the comment would later be about. <br /> Another good point on the show is that anyone of any age would not only enjoy watching it, but would take a message however to embarrass that message must be. These talks between Jesse and Michelle are very touched, if one does not think of it as childish. <br /> <br /> Overall I might say after watching every show at Full House, there's a happiness in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
