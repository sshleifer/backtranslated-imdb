Fast-paced, funny, sexy, and spectacular. Cagney is still terrific. Blondel your charm and understand it with energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censored film by the innuendo of the script, costumes, and ways to handle each other. Previously Bichin was bikini! This is not to have fun ban for everyone. I do not understand the problem of John Garfield though. Is it important whether it's this movie? If it is, its screen is so short that it was basically a prop. You need to look it frame by frame even to get it if it's there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but never saw this one before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it not a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
