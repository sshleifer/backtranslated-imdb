NOT NO (3+ outta 5 stars) Another thing to commit from the director of the movie "Cube". This time around there are two main characters that find themselves and houses transported to a mysterious white cancellation. There are literally NOTE outside of the two-story small houses. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought the comedy tune set for this movie from the go-go was very ill-conceived. There need to be some humor, certainly ... and I have no problem with the humor that was eventually derived from the struggle of our two heroes (the final "confrontation" was definitely a hoot) ... but I really thought film in there would be a lot better if it remained more rooted in reality from the beginning. After looking at the movie I watched "Make" features on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the "sillier" comedy aspects ... make it looks a completely different movie (and a little better). The last hour of the movie is where things really start coming together ... the same way in a recent movie "The Primer." The actors are good when they do not have too many comedy comedy. They are truly credible at the "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this movie as a failed experience in the middle point ... but it won me over to the end. (And continue to look at the credits for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain it.)
