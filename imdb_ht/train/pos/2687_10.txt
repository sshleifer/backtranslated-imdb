No other movie has made me feel like this before ... and I'm not feeling bad. Like I do not want my money back or when I wait to watch this movie (9 months) or I feel bad about using two hours of a summer summer sun in order to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is because no matter how hard I wrack my brain I just can not seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages ​​that movie was in its sum up. I have no idea what has been going on all the time and half way in the movie I needed a Ril. There is no movie ever made with me before. Never in my life I wanted to cabbage, milk, and bag that much.
