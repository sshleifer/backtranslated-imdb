Claire Denis has demonstrated that film does not need to tell a story, that it is enough to create an experiment that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will be. <br /> <br /> Officially the idea of ​​setting a non-linear film is the older man living in the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dog, who still has a guy but whose cardiac status is increasingly threatening his life. She has a son and a little family who often meet with her, but when she finds she is in need of a heart transplant she's going to go to Tahiti across Japan to find a heart transplant on the black market and recindle a long lost relationship with a son he formed a Tahitian woman years ago. What Denis does with this description of a story is to use his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, man's interaction with humans vs. animals, etc. Many of the time 'the movie' does not meaning, but that's because we try too hard to connect all the points out in front of us in beautiful pictures. Life is sort of like that: we look, see, observe, integrate, process, and do in it what we will. By using this form of films (much as it did in the beautiful 'Beau Travail'), Claire Denis developed a signature technique. If you do not see the viewer to get the finished product reward there is a lot to do with our individual methods in visual and conceptual visual processing. This is an exciting and visually fascinating movie, but many viewers will find it a hefty conference over much. Maybe it will look again to change that. Grady Harp
