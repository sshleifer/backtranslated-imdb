Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest Sci-Fi movie. While at film time is a little preachy and the act can be a bit bigger, it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it's very original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, no movie I can think of is something like it. Secondly, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible - using paintings, patterns and great designs to create amazing scenes in both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Sure, you might sit back and hit the movie because, by today's standards, the effects are just so-so. But you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the movie came out in 1936 and it must have really wondered audience. In many ways, the sets look very reminiscent of the "modern cities" featured in the World Fair in 1939. <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems to be torn by the question "is really that stupid orn , are we yours? The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true? A final note: I saw this twice on TV and just a while ago on video. and with the print quality - particularly the sound. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it is a lot of cleanup products and will provide if you want to captioning. As the sound on the video keeps cutting out really would appreciate this!
