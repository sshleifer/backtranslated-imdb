I liked this movie. First, because it is a family movie. Second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family, and far less hysteria than I've usually seen in the movies. Brothers are very close, but they are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the younger brother is noble, but does not need to end. I understand that Leo's choices about how to cope with his treatment may not have been one of the most popular ones, but I believe it was the right choice for him. I can not believe that this was a French TV program. It has great production value. I gave this film ten, and I think you'll be too, once you've seen it.
