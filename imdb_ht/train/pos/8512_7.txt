I can tell you just how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I did not see it again, but I cringe in thought of anyone actually paying to see me drinking. Especially consider what we did this year. The thing is that they are probably about editing it. Especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke in the tits of a Mexican whore (they probably should follow it around). We made a few come and go on hand but aside I can not really remember anything. I was the MC in a few scenes (from what I said. What can I say to you is that everyone avoids the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits in the world (or the girl lost his girl lost). Overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is over.
