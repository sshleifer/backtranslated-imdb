"Cinderella" is a movie about a young girl whose mom passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's Miss became very mean to him, and made him perform all of the work around the house, like cleaning up after her from evil stepisters. One day the king sent a message to all the women just going to the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella did not get to go, but her stepisters did. Cinderella was upset and thought that there was no way he could go to the Royal Ball, until his fairy appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to go back to night because when the magic changes returned. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella lost track of time and the clock struck midnight, so she ran out of the palace and lost her wiggle slip. Then the king ordered the prince to find the women who put the shoes. Duke dug all the houses, but finally found the women who he belonged to, Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairy. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant of his own family, he had not loved him, but with a little bit of magic life he changed around and finally found love. "Cinderella" is the music. When Cinderella's beautiful fairy tore her magic, she sang Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, he was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I never forgot it. I also loved the party when Cinderella and the Prince sang this song so this is love while they dance because they realize they are in love. Overall this film was my favorite movie when I was a little kid because every girl wants to live a life story story.
