This movie is the best movie ever. I can not remember the last time a film drew tears in my eyes. With a tear, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogue, Music, Acting, Story / Draw. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a Street made famous in the King of Masks and a girl who sells as a boy in bazaar serf. Little girl liked to be his daughter and King of Mask loved a grandchild. They were not conventional in real. Each scene was simultaneously priceless. The camera work is impeccable to your flu. Act of inspiration. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of masks. Rene Zhou "Doggie" looks beautiful and has played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played helpful characters and dogs very well. If you do not have this movie, try it once, Watch It.
