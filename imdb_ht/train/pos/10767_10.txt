Of course I should give this movie 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the writer just merely the main once upon a crime. Rodolfo Sonego writes screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy. It was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his story in writing. So, Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check his biography, you can see the number of movies made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who starred in her story. My uncle visited Australia and my city, in 1968 to check out the location for "A Girl in Australia" and create a great movie about a proxy bride after World War II. You can see her humor in all of his movies. I found a copy of this movie on DVD lately. GREAT
