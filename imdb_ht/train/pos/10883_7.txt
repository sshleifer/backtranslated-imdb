This is surprisingly higher than average slasher, that's enjoyable and well done, with some decent pods! All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch very well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a $ 1, and it was amazingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer was wearing as it was actually a bit grenpe. The final was really cool, as I like how to beat the killer, and finish while predictable was very fun as well, plus all the characters except for Ringwald was amazing very likable !. It's decent to do and write, and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer did not mess in, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like myself) would really enjoy this movie, plus the opening was really cruel too, and they filmed the movie! This is a surreal slasher above average, that's enjoyable, and well done, with some decent gurus, and I say it's well worth the look! The good direction. Kimble Rendall does a good job! work here and work hard cameras, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast moving pace. Act strongly! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch very well, and I had problems feeling sorry for her, after all he assumed the heroine, it turned out better towards the end, but not much, I wonder he decided to do This movie, however, has done an excellent job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, it is ominous, crap and there was a hell of a mask, and this guy was not messy, it was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a beautiful bitch in her small role. Jessica Napier is beautiful and does fine as the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall well worth the look !. *** from 5
