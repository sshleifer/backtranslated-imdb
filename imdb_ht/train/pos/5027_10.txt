I gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its frightening elements and actors and my God the pledge! The thing is that I do not mean anyone anything about the act or story because it will ruin the movie. But I'll recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore now and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
