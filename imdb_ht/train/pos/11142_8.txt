Just kidding. <br /> Looking for enormous enclosures in the form of hustling in New York City, Jon Voight is young cowboy optimist (almost Gump-like Forest) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for Apple's Big Mercy with its whole ambitions and very soon Joe is the target both of the frog in New Yorkers and downsides from its thugs-street. His first heart, he took pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moved in with him in his collision in apartment and two literally struggled to survive. <br /> While midnight comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedy tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in contemporary Hippodrome's captivity in the late 1960s and its bold Warhol-party movie and its jukstaposing and ultra-urban New York City. The film Cowboy Joe Buck Bash somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing its out-of-place position. We feel his struggle to fit in, but also simply get enough money to eat Ratso Rizzo. Midnight Cowboy brings tears in my eyes as it is also rich in substance and a lot of heart. I imagine this film must inspire both Forest Gump and its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead characters and, at the same time, the Dukes Krokodil films as it deals with almost the same exact same mood in humor - a contrast between. country- coboy and slick New York cosmopolitanism. Very compelling and stunning creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
