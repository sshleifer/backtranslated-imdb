This film really deserves more gratitude than its recipient. It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood clans, favors and leggings in the crime world. The shotgun film is very good and delves to all of you are classic crime terms such as treason and power. This film is a movie visitor film, requiring attention and understanding and reward completely at the end. It is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change rather than another thread frame fight, martial arts season that seems to be the biggest contribution to the cinema world from Hong Kong and China. It presents an arrangement of great characters, actors and developments although it is just said I had to watch it twice just to nail what happened to some of the characters because of the great interaction of the movie. ALI of all 8/10 characters draws great but there are characters that do not stand out enough and the music did not really get me away and at times I felt it was not five well with the action (there's no action) for it loses some points for that.
