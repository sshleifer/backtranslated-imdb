William Powell's best trip as Philo Vance arrives in the case of murder killers where the murder of a dog show championship leads to two more murderous and an attempt at the human kind. It's all in the face out of how that leads to the person who and why. <br /> <br /> Belo Vance Believers by SS Van Dine were the most popular at the time and smart Mr Van Dine's calculate the way to sell her books one at a time of higher studio bidder. That's why you see many Vilo Philo and many studios put out. There was Bill Powell not going on major fame with MGM as Nick Charles in the Slim Man series, it would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vans. <br /> It seems that Powell entered his little Captain in the same competition where the dog was murdered in and then another rival owner became the first victim to murder. As usual Powell shows up Eugene palette as heather sergeant whose major contribution to the procedures was using his huge crush to shut off the door inside where the first victim was killed. <br /> I was told close from the inside and it was a top story so she figured out how. Powell has a nice group of suspects, as extensive as what normally is in a mysterious person. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, and Mari Astor, are doing their job well. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers loved this great version that in reality they rested again in the thirties and James Stephenson in his one and only trips as Philo Vance. It does not hold a candle in this one. <br /> As this is the only Vance Vance Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means seeing this one or finding it if you can.
