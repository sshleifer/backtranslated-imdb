I had to give this movie a 10 simply because he did so many films cast in black audience have FAILED MISERABLY done. This film was canceled at all the whore video clubs, and it also skipped gang, rapports, and bad language. She examines several relationships among doctors, African Americans, and African American male / female relationships romanticly on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the films blending the attention of light into humor and some very difficult and heavy problems. The movie will let you feel happy and sad all at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. He premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope that this movie will make it the biggest audience. Black people (and everything else) would like a movie like this - if only the industry was SMART enough to put out !! As a supplement - if your physician, a resident, a medical student, a premeditated student, married to a doctor, has a sibling, has a family doctor, or knows a great doctor - would like this movie too. He describes residence and practice in a true-to-life manner that has been greatly appreciated by doctors, resident, and medical students who have seen the film. Dennis Cooper completely resides in internal medicine - so it definitely applies his / her experience in the movie and that is very noticeable.
