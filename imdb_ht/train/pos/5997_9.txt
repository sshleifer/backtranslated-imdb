Let me start by saying I never reviewed a movie about IMDb before; however, I am in the video myself biz. And come out of this sensitive; I can say, without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short should be. It has a very good story and something else I like - (an even better ending twist). Opening was very well done, I loved videos chosen for it and how it was edited. <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W but the way the movie uses the effect it works. And with any movie that is all that matters. The film flow is working perfectly and editing has been very well done. From one side of the technique of things (which is my side virtually working on) everything is also very well done. There is no high tech. thing to point out. Only miners I have is that the end credit are a little bouncy. This is probably due to a problem rendered. Let me also say that I would rather see more of the love scene but I'm guys (so you can chalk up to a guy factor). So, in general, I read an 9/10. It is worth considering whether you are fond of Indian and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
