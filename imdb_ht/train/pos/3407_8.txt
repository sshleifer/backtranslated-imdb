Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer provide solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The ironic is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really gorgeous movies and sets, and yes Dietrich Valley's bottom of the fabulous clothes. She looks great; Boyer looks young and trim. <br /> <br /> History of a woman seeking meaning and an ancient life-seeking priest looks pretty stingy, but puts such real real and her sky somehow works, given the two stars, terrific by notes by Max Steiner , and a good cast. The film runs like 76 minutes and looks seriously modified, more certain characters just appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the next mother, the Tilly Losch dancer, the John Carradine Gina, and Basil Rathbone play .... well I'm not sure. It just rides from the desert and spoils everything! As others noted, John Gilbert sought stars and Dietrich. I can not help but think it would be wonderful. The role of world-tired Boris would have to fit Gilbert's great assets well. After the success of Queen Christina (and Garbo), her career would have come back on track. <br /> I can not think of any other 30s Dietrich film made in color. It looks great and put some awesome clothes. My favorite is Valentino as the Shiek-like outfit is set in the pool. Certainly worth a look for the lush together with the colors and the two big stars.
