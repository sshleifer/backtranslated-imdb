This movie has received horrific reviews from just about everyone who has been voting here but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If you're in movies like Citizens Kane and Casablanca id have sugest you at a different angle. But I still love this movie and everything about it though it is kind of "kiddy" this is one of the few movies I and my freinds could keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible . GREAT MOVIE. This movie should be AFIs number 1 because this high friggin class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have trouble seeing it because it's been made for the movie on a channel that does not exist yet. So I do not know how to get this movie, id loves to buy it for dvd but i can not find it anywhere. I still have it leaking out when it was first over, you can come over if you want and watch it bute I might sleep. this rock film and that basically all you need to know.
