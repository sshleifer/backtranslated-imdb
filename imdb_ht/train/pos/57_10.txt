I must say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked at t.v. and found "Home Room" and was already at about 5 min, but I was hooked. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen to anyone's life. I give it a 10, more if possible. Principal / writers and actors have done an amazing job. I think young people should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery, and more. I was crying for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this one. I loved it! I did not even know about this film, which is sad because it was so good. I wish he could go to the movies for more people to see.
