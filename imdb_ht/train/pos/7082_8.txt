First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you will see that the characters have the moments where they are the same. Her character in this movie is beyond every one too far ... and counts. The story begins in the future (not too far away) where someone sent in the past to find the source of a virus that swept most of mankind out of the face of the earth. The story seems to go in the direction of SF, but I think it's close to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. Regarding that. The movies tend to be faster and slower at some point and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you will be aware of this constant rhythm in history and reveal information that is not quicker or slow down. It's the one with the same speed that shed gently and beautifully. But this does not mean that the finish does not pull your nerves, causing its beautiful. As far as direction goes, it is prefect. Movies like these are easily destroyed by fierce convergence, but one has become far better. So if you're getting ready to see a sci-fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. B should have more movies like this.
