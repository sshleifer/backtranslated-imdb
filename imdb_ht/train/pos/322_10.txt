This film is not pornographic, it's not meant to be pornographic, and unless my uncle runs for president in the world it should never be considered pornography. <br /> Now that this problem has been sorted out, I can say I recommend this movie, as it's still being widely available. It's funny, the actor is great and raises serious questions (curious). I can not fully understand why this movie was so hurt, probably that's why I never went to ours. Lena is the true pioneer in the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and understanding are its main attributes, it is occasionally upset, but not all of us?
