I gave this movie a high mark because it was really nice, really funny, all while being unpretentious. I went to see this movie when he was playing in the Philly area, and he was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends. The film is well-written and well-acting, and even if it feels somewhat like a sitkon instead then a movie that does not take away the movie. You just do not get comedies like this again, where you do not need to shock people to be funny. The film film around a Ukrainian housekeeper finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. Even though at first it helps, soon it adds more crazy to their lives then the couple negotiates for. Things get more and more out of control until .... you'll have to see! The thought was laughing me, even after he left the theater. This movie just put me in a good mood. I can not wait until it's released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
