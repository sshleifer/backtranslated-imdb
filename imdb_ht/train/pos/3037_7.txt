The film "MacArthur" begins and ends at Jen Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata Military Academy United States at West Point in Hudson. We see a 82 year-old fraudulent Gen.MacArthur giving the start of the graduation class in 1962 on what an honor it serves the countries. The movie then goes to a barrier nearly two hours long on brilliant Gen. The MacArthur as well as controversial careers that begin in the darkest hours of WWII on the island besieged in Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942. <br /> <It was said to leave its island to Australia before the Japanese military Invading It's MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost disobeying a direct order from his superior President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dann O'Herlihy. Feeling that he will desert his people in their greatest hours of need MacArthur reluctance, along with his wife and son, did what he said only to he haunted him for the reminder of the war. It was this reason, escaping fire from death or captivity by the Japanese, who drove Gen. MacArthur uses all his influence to get FDR two years later launching a major invasion of the Philippines, instead of the island of Formosa, backing its promise to both the Philippine people as well as thousands of US POWS left behind. He will return and return with the power of the United States and the Marine to restore his commitment! <br /> <br /> In the two years up until the invasion of the Philippine Islands MacArther has defeated the Japanese forces of the South Perfect in a number of bright battles getting pregnant hop hop isolated and hungry hundreds of Japanese troops they surrender. The general did so suffering far less fears US military then any other commander of the war in the Pacific! <br /> It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that MacArthur has achieved its brighter victory as well as its worst military defeat. After flotting Korean Army's launch of brilliant and perfectly executed, and invading US Marines suffered less then 100 crashes, back doors or left hinges of Inchon. MacArther felt unstoppable to send US / United Nations forces under its command at the very border , along the Yalu River, in the Communist Red China. He said his subordinates that he was facing the threat of a massive earth attack by Chinese Communist Genoculture troops. MacArthur pressed anyway until this attack had been capped by the U.S. and United Nations forces in ribbons. The irresistible wave after wave attacked the Red Chinese troops forcing US / UN forces to back up the "Big Bug Out" in 1950 with their very lives, leaving all the equipment behind, across the North Korean border even abandoning the South Korean capital Seoul! This was one of the largest military disasters in US history and US forces lost a record, in the Korean War, 1,000 live on the very-Nov. 29/30 1950-in the Chinese Communist invasion! <br /> Concussion and humiliation of what it allowed, due mainly to its own arrogance, arrived MacArthur went to the offensive by opposing the Chinese Communist and Korean Nine forces but his own commander and Chief Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in his not having the spin or bowel does what to do: Launch a full scale invasion of China Communists and nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman has been just about enough waste from MacArthur's has to run into his public mouth in how he mishandling the war by not going all out, as MacArthur wanted him, against Chinese Red This was the last straw la! On April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman unceremoniously relocated to MacArthur in his command as the Supreme Commander of the US / UN forces in Korea! Pres. Truman, but very popular decision also, does not go along with MacArthur's total war strategy, preventing a third World War from breaking out with the Soviet Union-Communist China- who at the time like US-had the bomb atomic! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to cast it is very popular The MacArthur has also listened to his re-election in 1952 and its polling number so low-in the mid-20 that he was removed-in March this year- out in the US presidential campaign! <br /> There Was Wicked Gen. The MacArthur must be around when the political and military climate in the world has changed in how to make war in the future. With the horror of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a fact it would have been national suicide all gone out, as Gen MacArthur wanted, against the Chinese Red and it is very likely to touch in a nuclear burn that would engulf not only USSR and Red China but the whole world! It was important fact in the future war that MacArthur has never been taught, since the A and H bombs have not yet been invented in West Point. <br /> <br /> Back in 1962 we can see now Gen. MacArthur, after finishing his speech at West Point, became both a great and wise soldier, since he retired from the U.S. military, old etaman in his feelings about war and worthlessness in it. One of the things that MacArthur has taught at an early age, from his Civil War General Dad Douglas MacArthur Sr., who stuck his whole life was that of a soldier like himself war should be the last-by The first resort to solve problems between nations. In that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a life, with the advent of nuclear age, for Gen. MacArthur finally realized just how right and wisely his father a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, like himself, really was!
