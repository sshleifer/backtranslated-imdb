To get in touch with this beauty film pays attention to the sound track, not only the music, but the way all sounds help tie the imagery. How very beautiful the opening scene that leads to the expulsion of Gino sets the theme of ambiguity moral! Notice the musical way to introduce the characters as we have led to Giovanna's wedding. Not expected to find much here in the political life of Italy in 1943. Is this not over. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to the music of image and sound, you will be directed to a word that comes beyond neo-realism. At the end of the film we have Antonioni's time-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters passing and real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
