I enjoyed this movie. Did not see Andy Griffith at age and felt to fit this role perfectly. I've been associating it with comedy but I'm glad to see it's versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not troubled that "Dotty's anxiety disorder" could not have been rvatim from a psychiatric book. There are zilts in all-phobia and nevrese, and these can take on a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is clearly a sensitive and extra-sensory power as they are understood by local Indians, but not by any Anglo. It's not surprising that this character is vulnerable and unique. Even if this takes to be a "family movie" light, it is actually more sophisticated than it looks. Also, Hiram's twist at the end became a wonderful surprise for me and tied all the previous action together in a package. It is pleasing to contemplate the possibility of these spiritual councils.
