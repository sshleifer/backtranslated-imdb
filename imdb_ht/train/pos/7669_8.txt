Doctor Mordrid is one of the rare films that are completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. He really reminds me of the old series from the 30s and 40s. That is why I would like to see the following movies ... but judging by the rest of the full moon production simply was not enough breasts to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely useless sacrifice, there is too much for a family audience - that's unfortunate, because without this, Harry could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I was not sure Ms Nipar did not wander in an A-photo picture on this film, she was very credible. No, badly! Anyway - it's a shame they did not have the licensed Dr Strange bucks, because I think this could be a total kiddie phenomenon.
