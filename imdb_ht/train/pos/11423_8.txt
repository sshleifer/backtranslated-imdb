This movie shows life in northern Cameroon in the perspective of a French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official for the colonial government (French), and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives a sense of what life was like both for the settlers and for the natives with whom they are associated. It is a sense of consistent with another film I've seen about Africa in a similar period of time (Nearly Africa in 2001 (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is understated. The viewer is allowed to draw his own conclusions instead of having the filmmakers forced on it, although the sidebar of the story as a flashback from women's visit to south-west Cameroon as an adult gives some perspective.
