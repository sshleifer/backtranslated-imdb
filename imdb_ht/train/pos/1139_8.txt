There are some comedies like this, where almost every line and every character comes close to flawless. This is soooo funny !! And it's quite a bit of satire. Sally Field is the garden's title of truly outstanding actor and makes a good, if not perfect, works with his television entertainment. Sometimes it acts is just a little at age and overhead, but 90% of the time it's a riot! In the same league is Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Goldberg Whoopy (who unfortunately have too little to do here). Downey Jr can not be convinced entirely as a comedy and does not have the right time all the time, but it struggles with his party that is, to be honest, one of the most incredible. But the bright star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch if ever there was one that has more than one nasty secret (you'll see in the final absolutely stunning!). Unfortunately, Elizabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. I normally like Ms Shue, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different film. But it's not something damaged and for the most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, exuberant and memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it's on TV or wherever.
