It's really unfortunate that most people outside Canada think that only things that Canada produce are snow, timber and hockey players. This film is the second Canadian Supreme film I've seen in the last few weeks (the first "Violin Red"), far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is nothing but that; It is a senior middle-aged bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This sensitive film explores various things that happen to her about her family, her friends and her work, and the effects on her. At the same time, it is a fascinating and, I would assume, accurate, painted in the middle class, city life in India at the time. <br /> However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read the Rohinton Mistry book a few years ago. The movie, as expected, can not take all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good movie, read and see "Such a Long Journey".
