Recently, a friend and I discussed the influence of education and ethics when we grew up in the 1950's against today. He mentions Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, in 1798, wrote the rhyme of ancient Mariner. Both of us were required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and from English classes in college. My friend said, "His messages can even be called metaphysics in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite him and only remember bits and pieces. (I have problems reminding Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd find two copies of the poem for each could read it. That was easy enough, but I was very surprised to find it made in a movie. We look forward to watching the movie to see how it has been interpreted. After all, the rhyme of the former Mariner is not exactly light reading. After each reading the poem, we watched the movie together. We have considered the film a remarkable success, especially considering it was born in the 1970s, before computer, before so-called "Ken Burns the effect," and before special effects too often began to compensate for a lack of substance. Particularly remarkable is the 19th and 20th centuries illustrations abolished in "Little Artists known," such as Willy Pogany, early Hollywood designer. The film narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a school, added a tone of authority and credibility to staying true to the poem. <br /> <br /> Its master is in the layers of subtle messages, aiming without "instruction," or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality story. We found it as a refreshing change in today 'in your face' and the 'clobber on the head' mentality. Most of today 's morality messages in the films are two dimensions: extreme violence, murder and destruction marks the bad. Bad are really, really, bad, and good are super heroes. It is as if human characters lacked any nuances. The rhyme of the former Mariner is a celebration of the individual, character, of an appreciation of celebrating all the wealth of life offered, in the context of the greater humanity, d.ht, the ability of others to give others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, "no. Another surprise learned the movie director, Raul daSilva, is a recognized authority on early animation, and six award-winning award-winning books on film. This film's message is just as important today, if not more so, than when Coleridge was the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it to film. If I've always taught high school, which I've been doing for five years, I'd grab this one and show it to all of my students. There is a level of wealth here that naturally leads to discussions about the big and important issues we all face, whether in 1798, 1978, or today - in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. /> Very recommended.
