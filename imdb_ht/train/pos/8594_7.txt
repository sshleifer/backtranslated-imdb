The Sentinel I was hoping would be a good movie and my boy was right.A great story first of all from a novel and I thought this was an original story but I guess it was not and it was a pretty story smart. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is too, but however it is very difficult to dig her in her role as Jack Bauer in 24 but eventually you do and it is very different in the Sentinel than he is in 24 .so someone else is trying to blow on TV roles but fail.Eva Longeria.She was not that good in the movie and had a back seat of the whole thing. After I saw the movie I had consistent dreams on the Sentinel and could not sleep. Sentelel appendix is ​​a good movie and I would recommend it.
