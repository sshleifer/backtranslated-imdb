It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and toddlers. I felt like instead of a movie ticket, I should give a member of NAMBLA. Based on Thomas Rockwell's respected book, Cooking for Fried Worms begins as any child's story: moving to a new city. The new kid, fifth grader Billy Forrester was once popular, but he started once again. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who's 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Further complicating things is Joe's bullying. Her freckled face and sleeves are durable. It antagonizes children with the death ring: a crackerjack ring that rumors kill you if you're hugging it. But not immediately. No, the ring dies unleashes a poison that kills you in eight classes. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of thin wines in his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays it cool, swearing that he eats glass all the time. Then he launches them on Joe's face. Ewww! To win, Billy reluctantly bet that he can eat 10 glasses. Fruit, boil, marinated in hot sauce, crashing and spreading on a peanut sandwich. Each meal armed with an exotic name such as the "Slime Delight Radioactive", in which the children finally live out their dreams in a microwave living organism. <br /> <br /> If you've ever met me, you'll know that I have an uncontrolable hearty laugh. I felt like a croaking eruption in a little puppy that he "dilly dick" hurts. But Worm's worm is awesome thing. Like a G-rated movie my brother Farrelly, it is both imitating and delightful. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also a savvy shooter. To increase the glass feet to be consumed at 7 pm. In addition, Billy holds a dark secret: it has an ultra-sensitive abdomen. Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With these accurately, it draws on children's insecurity and tends to make exaggerated dilemmas in the world. <br /> <br /> If you have to hyperbolize this movie as the kids do the quandaries, you'll see that it is essentially about war. Liberty-fighter and freedom-hatred used pibesan boys as a full-fledged proxy war, only to learn an important lesson in unity. International leaders can learn something or two about world peace from Fried Worms. At the end of the film, I was comforted when two mom chaperoning behind me, looking at each other and befuddling and agreed, "That was a great movie." Great now, I will not have to register myself at any base legal data.
