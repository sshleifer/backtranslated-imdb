... On stage, television or in a book, the 'Woman in Black' is an exceptional ghost story. Other reviews have already said just about all there is to say about this movie, but I thought I would add my bright little reviews too. The made-to-TV movie has a deliberately slow act, which Arthur's main character character as it goes on his business as a jurist in 1920 London. I can understand why this could not be appealed throughout the palace. But for me, I like this British-style storytelling similar to any of the "Ghost BBC History" for BBC's adaptation of the great M.R. James'. In the second act, the ghost story kicks off as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to clean up the affairs of a dead customer. The third act of relentless build up to a spine-tackling conclusion ... As a Londoner, I saw the play. I own the book, DVD-R and have the audio book unbridged on my iPod, too. What's sure for me, 'The Black Women' on any medium is a few ghosts and stories equal. It is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 released DVD.
