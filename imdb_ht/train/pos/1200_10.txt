There is no illusion, this is a moral story. Granger is the former buffalo hunter, tempting back to the plains once again by killing-crazy Taylor. Granger can see the end is near, he feels deeply about the price of hunting-on the cows, the Indians and the country itself. Taylor, on the other hand admitted equivalent to killing Buffalo, or Indians 'being with a woman.' While the Granger's role in the tortured hunter is superb, it's Taylor who steals the show, as demently, 'totally' the immoral out for the fast buck and the goodtimes. There's not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story moves together quickly, and we are treated to a fine character performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is just as poignant today, as in the 1800-person relationship of the country and what about it, and racism. Considered then, the censors must have hated the chapters during the scenes of the home 'bawdy', Taylor's relationship with the squaw, and many of the dialogue. Although downbeat, this is really a great western picture.
