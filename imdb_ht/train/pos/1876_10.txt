An adaptation of the book 'Find Fish'. This story is about a slightly frightening marine Fisherman (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past in a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant first performance by Derek Luke and a still stunning performance by Denzel Washington. This film was incredible on many levels and I was disappointed that she did not have an Oscar, I think it was because she was released in a hurricane so she was neglected. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will be touched by his story and really make the audience become sympathetic to this young man who is Fisherman. <br /> <br /> If you like true story inspiration, then look for Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thanks
