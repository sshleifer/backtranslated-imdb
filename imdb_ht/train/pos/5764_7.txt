I originally reviewed this film about Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and withered. I believe I was called "miserable" and a "turkey." Well, well, not the most standard, it's still a turkey. It has received almost no production value, which little draw has to do almost no sense, and the act is on the level of a third-class play. That said, this has really grown over me over the years as a sort of classical camp. In fact, all film directors Todd Sheets have had this effect. They're almost like Ed Wood in that regard: Watch them on and off and pick out the lines flubbed, continuity mistakes (even zombies, from different positions!), With other flaws. Say this: The blanket is a very nice guy, and while this one, one of his first productions, is not great, it has become better. And I must add that the only really actor / actress of the film is Kasey Rousch, though I can be partial, as I went to school with her.
