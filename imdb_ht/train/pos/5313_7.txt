As I have no fans of nearly any post- "Desperate Living" John Waters movie, I was warming in "Pecker". After it came out of the underground, Waters produced a garbage-free version of her earlier work ("Crying Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") of dead-hard fans watching and tasting like watering down liqueurs." Pecker ", who does not try to make Success soon, is a slight, humble, humble comedy about the whims of celebrities and pretensions in the art world. Waters clearly know this topic well because it was also exposed and sold ( at ridiculous prices) some of the most popular pop art ever created that you could not imagine anyone being able to give away if it was not symbolized by their name "Waters." Edward Furlong is fine as "Pecker style" "Waters' non-Histrionic is at ease with the subject.
