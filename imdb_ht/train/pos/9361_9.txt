Rehearsing me (titled after the song of whom) is a movie that sure brings you a tear in almost everyone. It was a story moving to a guy (sandler) who lost his family in the 9-11 attacks attack attacks world. Years later, she ran into an old college (cheadle) college that she did not even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress followed by the loss of her family. Two old friendships with Cheadle's character, Johnson, realize that he must find Sandler's character, Fineman, some help before it's too late. This was the first movie that made me cry in a long time. It's completely worth seeing and after seeing it, my positive viewer will appreciate his or her family.
