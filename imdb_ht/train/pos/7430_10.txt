My favorite person really liked this movie, and it was particularly moved me. The main actors are giving us great performance, which in the end, is really heartbreaking to know what finally happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> Alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and the song is just as great as they are. So I did not feel surprised when I learned he had won 5 gold globes (the most rewarding movie of the Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a couple. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A big movie, which has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in it, surely as a "co-director"). His artistry is the largest, and will surely please you!
