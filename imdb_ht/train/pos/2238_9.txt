As this film is completely in Swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most German to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years, so I was lucky to understand this huge parody of the Lord in the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies in this type (for example, Scary movie, loads of scifi parody etc.) but this one is the best one in that kind, I've seen too far. I give an 9 in 10. The only reason I can not give a 10 is, because there are some little details that might have been done better and because they have supplied no translation in any language on the DVD , So there's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand.
