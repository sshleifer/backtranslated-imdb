I was originally watching this movie ago during Cinemax Friday after black series (back when the cable box was built as a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Though there is a free aspect of the film it is well-acting. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou to look fabulously pink. A movie like this should probably not be done In those politically correct moments (at least not in the U.S.), since it seems sensationalize things like violence, theft, and casual sex. This film proves that with a talented cast & talent directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject. It's saddening me to get Patrick Dewaere to commit suicide & in the near future I'll check it out with Depardieu & Miou - Get out your hankerchief.
