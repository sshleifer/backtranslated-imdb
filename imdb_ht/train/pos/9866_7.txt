Just saw ICE age, a very funny and especially beautiful movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are lovable and nicely out but what really shines is the digital set design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really wonderful world look in an amazing use of colors. Sometimes the touches of the bright reality (especially the water was impressive), but, however, it's a fantasy world-based reality. Including loads of vast landscapes especially help to minimize the costs of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar movie bright and bright technique, this one bright and effective use of techniques to know how. babble techniques, entertain the movie, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.
