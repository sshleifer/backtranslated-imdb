Albuquerque is a movie that has all elements of a Western class, except one: the story, which really belongs to a class B or C. That was acceptable at the time the movie was made, when people were happy many see a west of color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. However, for those who enjoy the old west, it is fun, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that has recently been out. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lane Chaney means as always, and Randolph Scott is a bit more happy than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city, but the city shown here might be just anywhere.
