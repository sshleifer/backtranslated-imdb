I have joined IMDb so people know what a great movie this is! It's not often you come across a film that is visually moving and visually cinematic. You've read the plot for all I mean is not watching it because you want to see a clash of cultural identity the religious religions, because that's his typical misconception, rather just appreciating and achieving it on a father and her child on a growing journey to know each other in their struggle. Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and alien. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never look anything subtitled or just use the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is to be longer and see what's going on
