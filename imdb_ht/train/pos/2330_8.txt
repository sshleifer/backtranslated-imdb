This show is good. I love acting, funny and reckless bits of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc., all made great in the show. The show began in great and humorous ideas, its basic logic of bringing dead people back to the first and honestly series, as those who said, the first few episodes in the second series was a bit of a down but later she looked good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC just leave it end up until the end of the whole episode? I really want to know how the story will be. I think it should give a chance as there are still many viewers who love it.
