I loved it. In general, I'm not a comedy and comedy fan, but I do like Whoopi. I'm also part of Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for fun, but when I feel over-stressed or really mind-dying, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex has allowed me to do this. That makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even go to do something while she was running. Whether you have not been rated as "good" or not really important for me. And no, I'm not a juvenile. I am not a moron.
