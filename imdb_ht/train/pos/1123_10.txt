I really liked this one, and although the end made me angry, I still gave her 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four girls college (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) will be Drive down to Florida, on how to meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really add nothing to the draw, but at least a bit likable. Girls agree to meet guys in Florida for some fun, but they have trouble machine and never do it. One of the girls decided to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls has to use the toilet, being in the middle of nowhere has no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon, she witnessed as a man (March) a woman scolding, in the horror girl ran the area, she does not get too far but managed to get lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, To the girl, the other girl runs away, manages to make her go back to the car where she is also killed. <br /> Eventually two girls left to get to each other and to break into the gas station to get arrested. This is when I began to become angry, poor girls are afraid of their lives and the redneck cops do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are treated seriously with one of them left alone for the fool to kill it in the cell, the remaining friend managed to escape, but not without getting into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This film has stripping, good actresses, a sweet scene imitating psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid stories. Some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive to the people who do not like to finish, but over all, this is a great small sex movie.
