An excellent family film ... gives much thought to ... There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it's so ... real ... things can happen in everyone's life. And do not forget about acting - it's just scary! Just look at Frankie, and you'll know what I thought about ... This picture is a real can't-miss !!!
