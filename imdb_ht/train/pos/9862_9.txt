Finally I got to see the infamous "Ice Age". Apart from being not as funny as I would expect for after seeing the brilliant collar does not have a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (besides, it's Fox's first attempt at a movie full movie CG) but it's got immense hearts and on some occasions (like looking at Manfred's eyes after seeing glimpse sad in his past) I found myself on the road in tears. But when they assembled the baby and his dad I just could not keep them in again. A movie with no market problems on the thin line of clogged and clich√© and managed to bring more than the best out of it; The end result was one of the most touched animated creations I ever saw. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you (with great voice talent as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially in Scrat's name make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus Dodo scene, which is my favorite personal comic scene in 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly do not find it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will take the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and those who can forget Pixar's creation) then I do not really mind, at least for now. 9/10
