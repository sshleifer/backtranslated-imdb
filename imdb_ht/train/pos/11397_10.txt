Timeless musical gem, and Gene Kelly in the top shape, stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli, and wonderful music. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people look with a smile and say "do not do 'em as they use them!" But they never did such good works. Climactic 25 minute sequence of music without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in movie history. Magic films, clearly emerge from the heart and soul of all involved. A must see!
