Yakite! Yes-Boiler (translated as fresh Japanese cooking) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pot, for Japan, and for the Japanese, which will recognize the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, that's just about the outside. In fact, Yakite! Yes-boiler is not really on the bread, but the reaction that comes after eating the bread, and pun that comes with the reaction. The series is lovable because of these puns. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan, and dragon balloon blockbuster blockbuster as the matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all there. So what makes this title different from other titles in the same way as Girls Cooking Master or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike other people who use cookies for global domination, Yakite! Yes-pan is purely comedy. Sure, there are times when the story turns out to be drama, or even kill, but the comedy atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at their own look in the sky. Just watch it. <br /> Just remember that this is also fiction, although some of the bread made here are based on real bread, the home made Japan # 2 will not turn you into a Super Saiyan or turn your body into rubber .
