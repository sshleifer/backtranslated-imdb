Yes, that's right, it is. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange looking look are both designed so that this game can be performed. It was amazing first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. The play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm which is always so furniture but indefinitely has. A must have for any N64 owner, and one reason to get an N64 for everyone else.
