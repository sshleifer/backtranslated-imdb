Lars von Trier in Europe is a worthy echo of the Third Man, about an American coming to World War II in Europe and finding himself entangled in a dangerous mystery. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the U.S. Army during the war, arriving in Frankfurt as the war is about to work with his uncle as a car driver sleep on the Zentropa train. What he does not know is that the war still secretly goes with a group of terrorist groups called Werewolves who are targeting American allies. Leopold is strongly taking anywhere, but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), femme the fatal daughter of the owner of the train company. His father was a Nazi compatriot, but is forbidden by American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help get the German transportation system up and running again. The Colonel soon enlists, or force, Leopold to be a spy (without giving him a choice or luck to think about it) to see if the Werewolves could carry out attacks on the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and noir-way movie, where everyone and everything is not the same. His surprise look Leopold's deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his unconscious circle, even the official train company that comes to examine his work ethic) before he finally nailed and humorously and violent take control. The movie is infinitely unforeseen. <br /> <br /> The movie stylish shotgun, it always takes place at night during the winter and lots of snow falls. His injection into black and white and the color shots randomly appear at all. Also, the background screen shows the counter images and images up front. Add the former Maxown Sydow's hypnosis, and Europe gets somewhere to dream from this world. This is now a favorite personal movie.
