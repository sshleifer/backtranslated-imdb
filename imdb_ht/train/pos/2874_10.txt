Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated bad by her cruel miss and stepisters. One day a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to go, because her stepmother and stepisters will not let her. With the help of its fairy and animal creatures, it is cut into the ball, and the warning to return home at night. At the ball it meets the beautiful princess Prince. When the clock hits midnight, it runs home, leaving behind one of his glass slippers. With the help of his animal friend, his true identity is revealed. He and the later ruler marry, and they live happily ever after. <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a great box office success, and continued to celebrate this day's charm. He had a well-written script. Characters are memorable. The songs, including "a dream is a heartbeat you do", "So this is love", with the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", to help tell the story. This was my favorite movie, and it has not lost any of its charms. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, old radio programs, and a restore movie in the movie!
