I did not have too much interest in watching Flock.Andrew Lau co-led chief of trilogy in hellish affairs but was shot from the sheep and was replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I felt that Lau had made a good movie but he did not meet the study, so fired him and employed another director.This usually does not work well (let's remember the invasion) .But the sheep became better than that I was hoping.It is not a big movie, but it's an exciting and entertaining comedy. The character development very well done and I could know the characters very well.Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible .Richard Gere and Claire Danes carry competent performance. Well, let's go to the negative points. A component that really bothered me (there was a moment in which he irritated me) was the excess of tricks edition to the movie more "mood" and style. Tricks feel out of place a presence d are arbitrary.Plus, I think the movie should have been more ambitious. In spite of that, I recommend the flock as a good thriller. It's not memorable at all, but it's fun.
