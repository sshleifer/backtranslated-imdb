Do not look for a underdeveloped plotline here .... just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one. A galleries of stars pop up as the classical cartoon character classic of this live action comedy, which features incredible makeup and design design, not to mention knockout performance from Beatty, Madonna, and Pacino. Great fun for kids and adults alike. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
