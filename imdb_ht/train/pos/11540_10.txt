This is Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praise! "The odd couple" is one of a jewel gem pictured in. You were Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fervently clean-freak, and a great thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slave. These men have a lot of jobs though. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men divorced, Felix's wife is near, while the Oscar is on the other side of the U.S. (the west coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living in a roof together without driving each other are impossible, as well as improbable. It's a whole lot of laughter and a whole lot of fun. I loved the part where those two British neighbors spoke with both Mrs, and after Oscar pursued Felix, he was lucky with life and when he refused to have dinner with them the earliest night. It's about time that Felix needs to lighten. I guess all their own-self-explaining phenomena. They can be fiery, yet they should also be patient. A very fun movie, with a classic nuke. Neil Simon in the "odd couple" is a must see classic movie. 5 STARS!
