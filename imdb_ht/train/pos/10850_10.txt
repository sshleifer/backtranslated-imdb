What a good movie! At last a photo reveals a sex side of rock: the illusion of fame. Well-known rockets are getting old and forgotten, not the music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced over the Rock Haley Rock across the clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best movie on rock n'roll I've ever seen. Far better than Epina Tap for example. Why? Because of the crazy condition, people are mature. They have a different point of view on rock, about love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy young people. Beyond the story itself, we see characters and their own personality, weakness and dream. Like anyone in us. Spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome band!) And finally think of your own future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
