Bon Times was an inaugural comedy on the first nuclear-based family of Chicago projects. If not, you live in the inner city, ghettos, suburbs, or rural, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a family show black poor. But they do not stay on it. They get humor and have solid and moral families. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air except I did not like to kill the father that I agreed with Esther Rolle who was struggling to keep the family together. But despite all the fighting behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all liked the JJ Dynamite and his antics. We looked at Penny Janet Jackson's grow up a bit. This show was inaugurated to show the despair of drugs, gangs, and alcohol. Without preachy, Evans still tried to do the right thing rather than doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
