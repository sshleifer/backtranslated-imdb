A hit at the moment but now better categorized as an Australian Cultural Film. The humor is great, unsubtle, and, at the final stage where a fire studio BBC is extinct by urine, bit. Includes just about every cliche about traditional Australian pilgrimage in the 'old country', with all clich√©s about violent people, stuck up, whinging, Tory Brits. Should be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well-known, and Austrian actors in this generation, who can 'get' the humor. Americans - forget it. The language and the jokes in the Australian dialect in English and as such will be unimaginable.
