10 PROMOTES OR MISSION is one of those who 'under the radar photo' that is soaked in the simplicity that most independent movies have: honestly, its ad hoc performance leads - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega who established quite a complementary easy toilet duo . The big thing is, this whole movie looks incredible despite the roots of its 'road movie'. How character named Morgan Freeman in Cyclic (not physically) reaches where she meets this jade check-out girl with an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (who's going to be getting on with her filander husband she plays by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left to give witnesses more than inferior and witty witty - two people on the opposite side of coins in society - is devious. So, in a nutshell, while there is no bang! The earthly earthquake riots, this film is a little bit mood that probably otherwise was lost in the shuffle of indies that came out in 2006 but deserved to be seen, if only for its honesty.
