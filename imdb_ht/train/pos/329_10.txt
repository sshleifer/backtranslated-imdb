In all the versions of the Odyssey (or in any Greek mythology history for that matter), in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true of the original scenario - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that the swimmerherd Eumaeus acknowledged the disguised Odysseus of his hut - realistically acting with native landscapes and suits all contributing to making this a truly memorable masterpiece, by some Hollywoodish sword-and-sand B- flicker movie. Despite the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the scenario, it can always be upset and that of what is going on and what the actors are saying (giving you a good handy text in the Odyssey). At least I did, and so much so that he inspired me to study the Italian language best to appreciate the movie even more.
