Rob Roy is with seasoned pastimes of passion and action! Some military athletes. Liam Neeson gives an immense performance such as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in her career. Jessica Lange is the perfect letter as her spouse. They have the most passion and chemistry I've seen in a couple of screens. Jan Hurt gives him the best snotty aristocrat performance.Tim Roth shows one of the great screen screens. That recall of Mary is repugnant and arrowing.He really is a magnificent battalion in this movie. The final score between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best ever ever swordfights.Well script, and Michael Caton-Jones direction is impeccable. 10 out of 10.
