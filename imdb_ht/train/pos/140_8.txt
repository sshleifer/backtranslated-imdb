Normally I do not like the entire set. They are all predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast. <br /> <br /> These series however, are well played, the story follows throughout episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be catching yourself. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and take you further and more in the mysteries of black and old secrets just lying under the surface of the mighty hospital.
