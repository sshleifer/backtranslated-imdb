This is a really good movie with one that I enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine is as scary as always. Michael Caine has gotten a reputation for taking any role in any movie that does not matter that's the good or the same way but he does a good turn of Sidney play. From the beginning it's written well. Who would have thought that Ira Levin wrote things creepy as the Boys from Brazil and Baby Rosemary could write something witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how you will go wrong with a good cast that is directed by Sidney Lumet. <br /> I'm really reticent going on because if anyone gave away anything about this movie it would be a crime. Just watch it and worship it.
