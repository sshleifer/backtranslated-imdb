Incredibly intriguing and fascinating, I found it impossible to turn once I started to look. I am usually one of the harshest critics but me this movie was just brilliant, strange as this may sound I could almost smell the air and feel the textures in places. <br /> <br /> From a cinematic I thought there was great use of light and texture. From orange glow in the summer light, down to the wrap plastic also has a distinct time of realism me. <br /> In a perspective of character I thought the notion of Victor Vargas as almost the glue that connected the story was quite inspiring, each of the other members of the family with a complete background simply caused major intrigue of main character himself. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, having known someone just like the grandma and having on the receiving end of just such a situation, I can say that the situation felt particularly realistic. The left, the accent, the cook and even down to the comments felt so authentic to me. <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started to look it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and it brought memory to young emotions, well worth a look.
