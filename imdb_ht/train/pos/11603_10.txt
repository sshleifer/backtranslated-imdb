The first time I saw it I got half of it but I looked and I knew later about it was about a salem witch trials. They focus on Sara Sara's family. It is famous for a curse that has come true. In her movie Dorcas's daughter's daughter and her husband's spirit of Sara Ann's Eve Putnam comes in the future of this girl's hunts to redeem her soul. which occurs at the end of the movie. Dorcas is described as the 5 year old witch who burns at the stake. That never happens to putnam save him from the flames. The girl safely goes to Putnam's grave to see that is not empty, but it is at first because she accuses her of magic, and allows her to burn to death. Now let's putnam save his spirit to salvation, and it's not a defeat in society for Witch's witch trials.
