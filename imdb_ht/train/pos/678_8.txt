Peter Weir's first success in international, the WAVE is a particularly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal aborigines. Richard Chamberlain provides a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life has become increasingly unpopular in reality as it delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal court rivalry. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who makes his best Chamberlin guide come to the realm of 'Dreamtime', an alternate reality / central deletion of Australian native history and custom tribal. Heavily in atmosphere, deliberately limiting the plot, the movie builds into a disturbing finale that is slightly diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limits. But an intriguing film that has the overall impression of mystery and scary caches just below the surface of what we see as 'reality' will remain with you.
