Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - here adapted to the screen - it's like Jane Austen for men.

"There are many hilarity, difficulties, and not a little frustration like St Ives trying to fight and finding his way back to a family and his life barely knew. Throw is absolutely stellar and too often the infant sees Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a fun refreshing flora of resourcefulness and Miranda Richardson almost walk away with the film as she's wiser and worldly, having and seeing-all Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides humorous relief in the highest order. <br /> This is not going to be the biggest movie ever seen, but its charm is undeniable and the full movie is going to be with a stream of energy and life.
