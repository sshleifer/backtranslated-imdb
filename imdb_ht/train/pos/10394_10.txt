A magical journey devoted to Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two titles in the British movie have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most ravishing Technicolor early, a Sublime and Shimmering Miklos Rozsa notes music along with the juucca hummingbird of Sabu, the theater and malignant villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all works beautifully well . Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father, Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect cynic that is incomprehensible. DO NOT THERE! Since posting the above comment, I've found the recently released DVD and can honestly say I could never see the picture well until watching this DVD version-Clear and resolution is so precise and the colors are so Stay alive that I was stunned-This amazing classic can look a long time and never fails to enjoy the fun viewer. Again, I AM!
