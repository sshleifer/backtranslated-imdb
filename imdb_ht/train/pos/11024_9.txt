This movie is just great. It's fun in the beginning of the end, you're still going to the edge of your seat across the entire movie. In my opinion this film is very discontented by the critics. <br /> <br /> Sly costumes perfectly in the role of the well-trained guys Gover Walker-guys. Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. Then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen in him as a villain. <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place in a hill with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
