Roads to Deny, an ineservedly-neglected film this year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion my best work), a director who had previously won Oscar for the widely acclaimed but controversial Indian Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time finally intensely and sadly. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and cheerful family of outdoors during difficult times in air depression, Michael Sullivan, a father of two kids, played by Big Tom Hanks (I do not admire him, but should say that ) is a hit man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. Her older son, a thirteen-year-old boy Michael Sullivan Jr., was perfectly play by Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blatant ignorance to find out what his father worked with and how much money families lived there. Pushed by his curiosity and his aspiration to know her truth accidentally become a witness to a murder, committed by her father's father Jan Rooney. These discoveries hit an innocent soul and caused many events that changed their lives forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the origins and decorations are perfectly created, corrected and cinematographic are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points in the movie and key factors in the film success of father-son relationships in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances in his career in a very unusual role for him, and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth mentioning a very nice note by Paul Newman and in the result we find an exceptional job of everyone involved in doing this beautiful (but one more sad time) masterpiece. I believe the Road of Destruction belongs to the greatest achievement of film-making in this decade and without doubt one of the best films of the year. <br /> Here are 10 out of 10
