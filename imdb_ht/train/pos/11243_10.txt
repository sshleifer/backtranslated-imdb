I saw first "Breaking Glass" when it was published in England in 1980 .. I liked it then and having just kept it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it still is great. The only thing I'm sorry is that I can not get the sound track or DVD's in the stores ... ... anyone cares for some light light or I must order it to some on internet prize companies. But returning to the music movie stands up to the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain 80. Actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same one reasons They were "Thatcher" and what he did in the country at the time. Please, if you get the chance to watch this movie you will not regret!
