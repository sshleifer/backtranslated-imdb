"My left foot" is a very impressive movie that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who has been crippled with cerebral palsy and learned from painting and his left foot, the only member of his body having control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as the best actor for this movie, which I'm not absolutely sure worthy, but still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and occasionally funny comic. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's dedicated mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this film is that it's a bit too real at times. When Brown is in despair and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, the movie can be hard to look. This gives it a feeling of depression that can shut down some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for people with disabilities and other difficulties overcome. Those of us who are not disabled and always consider ourselves have problems inspired by this film, because if a bit and a worse condition than we can overcome the difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, occasionally enjoyable, but hard to look. Can not be for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
