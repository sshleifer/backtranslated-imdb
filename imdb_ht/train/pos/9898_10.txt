My 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumed that you decided that you liked "Slaughter High" even before watching it. Yes, the story is typical-many years-after-a-salacious tale, but how can you not like some of the stuff that are pulling here? I could not have predicted that the scene was bathed in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we would be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new. Well, he does not pretend. It's the sort of flick of films that the characters in "Call" probably look, and it contributes to the rules about how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like to watch people suffer for doing these things? Obviously, he got sort of a luxurious reactionary, as people get punished for doing the '60s champion. But still, you have to love this stuff! So with exquisite Don McLean, this gesture did not sing for the king and queen!
