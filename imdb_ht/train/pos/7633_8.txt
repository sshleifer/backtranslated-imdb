Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known movie critics make me reluctant to admit how much I like this movie, though I only have an armed video-in-Japanese version of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to take it as a lesser known quote than before, most famously in great great "It's a nice life." For me, a great quote is a great quote no matter how many times it was used, and I should be happy to see more movies using this particular quote - the discontent man who gets a chance to get a fresh perspective on his own his life in a bit of "magic divine." <br /> I suppose the criticism of a more intellectual bent is not like pulling in the story, but I'm not going to criticize movies and notebooks - I go to movies to throw myself at them and let them take me where they will. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like me, you will be well rewarded by seeing this picture. Their performance is excellent at all, and the movie has been very well disposed. Beautiful choice of music, too. Michael Caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi does a good job as an "average Joe" guy guy who wonder if his life has not gone as it should. Linda Hamilton, still excellent, is again right on target here as the wife of love. Jon Lovitz amused as usual, and even has some amazing moments moving in "Mr. Destiny." No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a nice life," but saying he has to be? Take on its own theme, "Mr. Destiny" is a fun, well-designed movie, funny, and moving. I saw Japanese-dubbed video of her many times, and I'm sure I'll see it several times more. If that somehow makes me a "lowbrow," so be it! I'm just glad I did not read any review of "Mr. Destiny" before seeing it. <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my conviction and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the critics reviews!
