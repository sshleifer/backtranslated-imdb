This is what I was expecting when star DS9 premiered. By little DS9. That was a wonderful show in his own right, however he never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is that show. While it has a similarity to the original cartridge it is different enough to be original in its own way. He makes the ideas of our exciting exploration again. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so love. Another successful ingredient was the relationship that evolved between crew members. Viewers really care deeply for the crew. Enterprise has many promises in this area too. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel the strain on enterprise can lead to more and much more than is typical. I think when we deal with these grand scale characters in different races or even species, we find some very interesting and television ideas. Also, we should remember their performance, Blalock is very compelling as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a whimsical and strength of character that delivers a great performance. The rest of the cast also gave good performance. My only flu is as follows. The theme. It's good at different but a little bit of light for my liking. We need something a little more grand. Do not do orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And another complaint. They sell too much. They could fix this by selling less ads, or doing all shows from parters. Otherwise we will end up seeing the final acting shows getting wrapped up too quickly as one of my complaints to Voyager.
