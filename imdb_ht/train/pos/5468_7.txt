I do not see the rest, or any version for that matter, of "baby face" and Barbara Stanwyck until I hold it on TCM. What a great movie! In a Nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, he was pimped by his own dad since he was 14! Then she still blows and she has left Lily (Stanwyck) alone alone for his black chico maid, playing very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily left for big city (New York) decided to use her sex to get to the top. It does in great style! <br /> It seduces a pudgy clerk to get on the ground floor and the proceeds go hand in hand as disposable candy! One fiance his fianc√© and killed him near father-in-law, also the sugar-father Lily, then committing suicide! Lily barely blinks! STANWYCK is terrific as a girl who really does not know what love is. Then in Paris, she dropped to Courtland, played by George Brent, to marry, but when she's in deep financial, she bolted. Almost free with Chico and a half-million dollars, he realized he liked Court! Lily race to get it, but it will be too late? <br /> <br /> This is pre-zip Hollywood in its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music of the movie are perfect. This reminds me of "Original Sin" and Angelina Jolie, another flicking unjustly ignored with a humorous woman, who does not film ultra-romantic trends, will not love any FACE baby anymore, people who have the belief love, and power, will love it. Highly recommended! See it!
