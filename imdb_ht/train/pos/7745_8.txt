"Life strikes us in the face ........ we must try to stay beautiful" <br /> <br /> First movie from one of Belgium's best artists (she sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited movie- happy joy happy joy for flaming - really worth seeing, and a promising piece of work! It takes us into the lives of 8 main characters who live in a Vandredi- and Night. The title tells a lot about how we spend time with them: we're floating as they go on Friday night where they are somehow 'meeting. <br /> It's pretty style 'style cut' style. Superb music use. It sometimes takes the top of the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience in the way he shot. It keeps you really up with it while it's set in a small place and a lot of people have a big party ..... so hard to shoot .. Thank you Barman's menagerie for making this movie daring in these , already some years go, poor times of flaming flemish. You made my day!
