A beautiful piece of children's movies is buried in a world of reactionary Celtians. Around the story around the famous Book of Kels, believed to have been composed by monks from the small island of Iona, on the west coast of Scotland. <br /> Tell the story of a young abbots apprentice who goes through the jungle in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce coupe jumper of pagan mythology. In the hope of recovering a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The true beauty films lie in its' animation. Shadow cells in a bright and inspirational style of complex funding that can result in a seemingly simpler look. Deriving much from the style artistic of the Brilliant Network 's samurai Jack series for its genius engineering of branding and background depth, the secret of Kels creates a still affluent world of Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion. <br /> The story can be intensely accurate and the ways in life describe realistically missing but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the movie sets itself in a world of fantasy and mythical revivalist Celtic. The girl in the jungle is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is, as it slips from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph and kind of resembling the legendary Cheshire cat in Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is an absolute treat. For all ages, it's a wonderful piece of family movies. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be awed but rather pleasant to impress!
