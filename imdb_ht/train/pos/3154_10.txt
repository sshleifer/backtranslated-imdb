Show this is hilarious freaking! The jokes are original, god and I love Eric and Kelso! yeah i know what to say, after the 8th season it's not funny again because Eric and Kelso are not in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, comparing Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can take the funniest characters and change em and "I'm a cool guy" guy guy (Randy). It's not her fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th comic epic, it's still up, not as much as the seasons, but it's fine .. <br /> <br /> 360 are awesome , Red, Red is a real type of mental-abusive father :) and Kitty is still half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, she has moments too. The youngest characters are Jackie and Donna. They're cool, but not Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> big show. Dumbass!
