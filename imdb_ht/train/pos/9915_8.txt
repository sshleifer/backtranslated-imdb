I had nowhere to go. I was in a flight in Vancouver. I would probably have missed this movie if I did not choose Air Canada. Looking at a small screen at the back of the front seat, I found this fascinating and fascinating. I did float in a couple of places and jumped back, but I looked at her end. Now I'm looking forward to releasing the DVD in Europe whether I'll be well as transfixed when I can walk out the door is yet to be discovered! <br /> <br /> The composition of photography is stunning and the movie gives you a lot of insight and 'complete' the picture story they say. Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
