I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short. World of War is the best documentary of WWII that I've seen. I saw different WWII documentaries (not just English / North Americans) and this documentary seems to be the most comprehensive documentary WWII I've seen. I think he could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler got power, but he did a very good job in covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / just to everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the role of different nations. It has a lot of original footage, including colored feet and many eye witness (it's made in 70 when a lot more alive). It has great music and narrator. All-in-all I gave this one 10/10, because it's that good. (I have not seen specialties of DVD versions so I can not comment on these)
