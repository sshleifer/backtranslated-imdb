I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffle are different cats from one another, but they refer to themselves as "brothers." I often find myself trying to imitate tired, sighs accent on the Butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish municipality of Gordon. There should be more episodes made on Kimberly Human. The episode on the disguised cats themselves as pre-teen girls are admitted to Kimberly's Sleeping Parties in order to find thirst claws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a classic hilarious. We can not drink rootbeer in our home now without either making the Catscratch or the Hanson Brothers out of the film slap shot. Future Classic. Where can I find the first two seasons on DVD ??
