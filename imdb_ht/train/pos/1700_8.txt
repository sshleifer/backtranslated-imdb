I loved this movie. You have to respect the movements that are dressed up as little martians. Make sure the story was thin at times, but you can not take away the way he did. I used to watch this over and over again when I was 8. reading a movie child, and besides, it has some of the greatest quotes ever. Blend of the "Home on the Range" pronounced is scary. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 of 10.
