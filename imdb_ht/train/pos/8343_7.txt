Australian Fred Schepisi (a cry in the dark) directs this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and put in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man) is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, and a high IQ, which is higher with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and Academic Friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris . You can say they are not preppie shoes. Meg Ryan (Seattle Seattle, you received mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician. Perhaps it is because it is surrounded by all this genius. He thinks that if he is married to a high IQ. Its kids will have a high I.QQ. as well, but he does not know what he wants. Between Tim Robbins smiles nice and thin skip this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged in James Moreland's jerk, which works in animal behavior, but is very dark. This is a love of first-sight quality situation, between the mechanic and the math. Witty ideas and subliminal lines! The cinematography is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With so much help in all these brilliant Catherine falls for Ed, without knowing that he is a vehicle mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite Scene: Ed takes a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt, and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride on the motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leave all the free search animals! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain deprive you of your heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo "? Catherine Boyd: "Well I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tapes and all once and I'll watch it again.
