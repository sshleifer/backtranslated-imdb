If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this excellent film with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the most famous rock band back in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course, there will be many problems during the concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "flame still burns" is perfect. You have to look at it.
