I got to watch this movie by chance a few days ago while flipping channel. My expectations were not much, but it was an interesting movie. In 'Something Guy', Jason Lee played Paul, a straight-laced, Seattle-based fellow who is about to marry her Karen (Selma Blair) and settle down an incomplete life-span in the middle class. We first met Paul at his undergraduate party, where he announced no desire to engage in any of the activities that his normal singles (surprisingly few) friendship encouraged, in case he is somewhat naughty and joins the hot actress and it soon to be problematic and accountable. Of course, Paul's next thing to know, it's in the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a hula nude dancer, and his mother's phone in law informs him that Karen is on his way on. Oh, and the hula dancer is Becky Karen's cousin (Julia Stiles). From this small acorn of potential problems grows a vibrant oak of frenetic disaster, as Paul scrabbles out of misadventure misunderstood, trying to cover what he did to keep up the appearance of being a compulsive, family-oriented good guy, who's super-excited about his forthcoming bomb. His efforts to ensure that Karen remains no wiser about any potentially-potent potential of his party's ironic force Paul and closer to Becky's fun-loving, forcing him to question whether he really wants this life which seems to have drawn out for him. The film has the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a look.
