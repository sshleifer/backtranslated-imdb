One of the many cartoons Merrie Melodies has been amassing American cinemas during WWII, "A Hitch of Time" Bob Clampett shows a hobo power struggle against Elmer Fudd's dog. The little guy turned into a real sadistic while making a home on the dog's back, but Elmer warned the dog: "A more scratch and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile, the bug will set up dynamite on the dog! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer reads a comic book featuring Bugs Bunny and Porky Pigs. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs frequently co-starve, but Elmer never co-starred with Porky (unless you count very short "Nose Good Today?"). But for me, thought of Elmer reading about these other famous characters in his manner as he stressed the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of their existence in his universe even though they did not appear in this cartoon. > <br /> Of course, I probably go too far in my analysis. I'm sure the design has been designed as most entertainment, and it certainly amuses. As for "I could find this love" line, it sounds like it was something that the sensors would not allow, but somehow missed; I, for one, does not actually know what it was supposed to sound like. Was it a sexual thing? As for the end, I thought that I would see everything, I'd be tempted to look for more, rather than doing what the cats did (although it was a neat trick). <br /> <br /> The guys behind these designs sure had something for TNT, did not they?
