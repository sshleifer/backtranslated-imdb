German private TV is renowned for translating Dutch and ?? naturally ?? American format. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can not stop spyball comedy? Do not look at Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect another lawyer another dramatist as the Law & Order or something, well, go elsewhere. (Or look at the Law and Order as it's brilliant in what it does, but I digress.) E & S is funny, often addressing thought-provoking terms, funny, romantic, funny, funny, and witty, too. Frankly, I firmly confirm the writers did not get better deals after the final series. And cynical nature I need to regret herself: private German TV production. German residents will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> In short: Look at it. I do not have foggiest what the English synchronization is like, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch their four seasons. Pseudo-happy sequel included.
