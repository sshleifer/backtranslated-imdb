The first time I saw this movie as a pre-teen, about the age when the kids start thinking of their identity. I have greatly affected the scene of the man and the children he raises as his own. The older boy was haunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his brothers have the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes obvious that no children do not look like each other). The man still persuades this boy that he is father by the only definition that counts. The accused man must be the father of all the children, but one who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the stickers as well as compelling for their own story and conclusions. It's a big movie, though not the biggest movie Kurosawa.
