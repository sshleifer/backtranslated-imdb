Always enjoy the great talent acting in Harry Hamlin, Jim Lansford, "Strange Hearts", '01, which plays a straightforward as an arrogant husband, who seems to find all sorts of attention from very good young woman women, ie, Lisa Zane, (Lynne), "Monkeybone", '01, is a co-worker with Jim Lansford and you ask why she does not try to hit him for some fun. Annie Potts, (Kris Lansford), Breaking Rules, '92, is a very hot and sweet wife of Jim and she has completed the trust of her husband. Christ wants to keep her husband happy and even buy him a home and out of it even see it for himself. This movie will keep you guessing the END right!
