Everything was better in the past days. Even the children's TV. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this my fourteen year old comments but even in my teenage years I could not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of us who have ever lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is on a playful horde of animal creatures called Fraggles who live-amazingly-in a rock. But they are not the only animals. The rock resides with many other species such as the Doozers hard work and countless living plants. Outside the stone on one side lived inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle), on the other side of a family of Gorgs-assumed rulers of the universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leaders), Mokey (artistic and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and a Gobo friend), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (love nothing to do with sports and general feistyness) get caught in some situations Strange every episode while at the same time singing and dancing the cares. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - the plots can have complicated details that babies can not follow well, but the dance-dance routine will keep their attention. Characters are strong and likable, the credible conflicts and adventures are amazed. The Gorgs are awesome, Doc and Sprocket Enlightenment, Uncle Matt Traveling hilarious (the postcards are very 80s!) And the final episode, Change Address, really touch. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
