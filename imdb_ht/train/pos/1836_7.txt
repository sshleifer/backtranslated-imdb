Time for a hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast- Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Write by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> Eureka! We've got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen ?? in the 'Waqt' Vipul Shah, we've probably found this first year of good faith. Replaced with all the necessary ingredients at a Bollywood commercial fare, 'Waqt' has everything it takes for a movie clicking with the Indian audience. It's the kind of movie that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplates his next Phoren visit! In this 'legend of American emotions' then, we have a happy family (is not it still?) In three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the smoker-millionaire (does not ask how! ... there is something about selling games while delivering letters and all that badly-that gives a damn!), Marry and Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a father doting Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar made a serious decision on his son's negligence attitude towards their responsibilities in life. Love it for Aditya though, the results of his procrastination of the grave issue. However, when faced with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to throw Aditya out of the house-hoping that the new situation can make him more conscious of his own life. But this supposed solution becomes a problem in itself, as the rift between fathers likes child-raising and barriers to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to make a rocket-scientist realize that such a story provides enough opportunity to instill comedy and drama alike. So, pre-interval you have the comic initially comic, later annoying comedy of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and post intervals have gone for the moment of kerchief between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also announced the original playing Gujarati 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the movie based) does a great job to keep the narrative fluid. Dialogues tend to get consistent at times. It does not help that songs appear as acne on a young and marginal procedure. Clearly, a couple of numbers could be done away with. On the leading front, Vipul shows that he owns a natural flair for story-telling. 'Waqt', as well as his first first 'Aankhen' effort, manages to keep you interested in the last coil. On a personal note - fraud in emotion was a tad of hatred for me. But evaluating the audience reactions, he was working in the block. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'Waqt' is all about its performance that amount to one whole point in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is dependable as always. Its energy is visible and so its age! Shefali the tone of a finely nuanced performance and match the superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do than fulfill the role of perfunctory of a heroine. When it all boils down though, 'Waqt' is Akshay's car. I always maintained that Akki is as good as the role of his costume. Put it in a 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and it's fantastic, but in a 'Bewafaa' it is awfully bad. Here, Akki is probably at his best. Whether it's funny or emotional distribution, it is also near-perfect. There's also a scene scene for her fans! Ironically, his best best effort was to 'Aankhen'- and the same director and Big B at his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is by no means a memorable movie. It's not one that will be featured in the best films in our industry. But it is one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for a universal hit, Waqt might just play the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia- This is the second Akshay Kumar consecutive film after 'Bewafaa', in which she made on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> April 22, 2005
