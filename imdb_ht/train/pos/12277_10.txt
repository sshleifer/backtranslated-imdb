Perhaps the best Isabel Allende Book, the Spirit House describes an alternate history of Chilean, this one full of magic, a mystical veil, plus some kind of sadness omnipresent. This film gathers a great cast, plus a great artistic direction, and a script that can not contain all kinds of books. It's strange for an almost unknown country like Chile to find it quite as it is by this film, which may have only sin is aiming too high, and because of that leaving the public sick a little upset, especially because of was very little understood.
