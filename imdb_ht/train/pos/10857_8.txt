Johny To do here one of his best style exercises, make a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. The election of the new boss Yakuza is the start of a war inside the organization. <br /> In my opinion the wise violence is used in context, making a very strong gang movie. I especially love the way it tells the story, moving all the roles inside Yakuza's family, and making sure we see the violence, as the only way they have to solve their problems ... on, technical aspects, the movie is a good example of pause, rythmic and planned way of shooting a movie. One of the Hong Kong movie of the year. It's like hellish affair, but without the action-free violence scene, and the storyline is confused. Make recommendations for all Asian movies. <br /> (sorry for my english, best done in spanish lol)
