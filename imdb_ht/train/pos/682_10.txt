This is one of my favorite movie ever, and while it can move too slowly for some, it's well worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) dragged into a case that includes "Aboriginal" town, and this can not be ordinary. OK, there is a man who died but he was not exactly a normal killer. There has also been a larger than average rainfall lately, and the atmosphere in most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive. Aborigines are embracing a secret and refuse to spread their weight. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about "City" vs Aboriginal "Tribal", and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. Uh huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams and it's somehow the key that's happening, although no matter how many times I've seen this I can not properly grasp the exact connection. This is a very unusual and creepy movie, and is a wonderful example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The finish is a small limit but I'm literally taking it, it's the easiest way out and the most horrible. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
