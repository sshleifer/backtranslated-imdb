This film documented a transformational experience for a group of young men, and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative to the viewer. Some movies even love this level of addiction, and I can think that no other movie - documentary or drama - has achieved it. There is no other film in which I have both laughter and it's been very much called. Yes, it's about DMD and accessible travel; On these issues alone, it is a worthwhile enterprise, but it is more. It is about friendship. It is about life itself, on everyday living that you are alive. And it's a great, fun, narrative adventurous. That's why God creates cinemas! See this movie !!!
