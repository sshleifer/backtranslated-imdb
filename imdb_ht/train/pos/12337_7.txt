Poor Ivy: Even though the way it was, she had the bad chance to marry a good wuster (Richard Ney). As the film is set in the 20s or 30s, when Victorian rigid ideas in class began to fray into the edges, this uncertainty status ensures it unnecessarily. The Gretorexes (to call them) do not know where the next shilling will come from there yatching parties and fancy-dress balls in pleassunces his tempting applauseunces. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) made friends with a great older man (Herbert Marshall, who was born in middle age), he established one of his extra hats for her. Luckily, one of her pets is always strings together (Patric Knowles) is a physician with room consultation providing a poisonous cache, and which she has offered her lubrous worship. The fact that it implies Knowles by its phase a bit, as the hours climb by until it should hang in the neck until death. The turn of the plot depends on Sir Cedric Hardwicke police inspector; Mother Knowles' (redoubtable Lucas Watson); and Housekeeper Loyal Knowles' (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touch to this melodrama well above average; Fontaine's glowing face is supplying the rest.
