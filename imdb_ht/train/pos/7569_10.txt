At a time of our culture where reality is exposed as narrative is violence fiction as we know it on the small and large screen, "Apart from that" is a movie that expose real-life moments that feel honest, fresh and innovative in presentation there than I've ever seen before. The usual level convention food does not exist in this film, leaving a content audience to sit down and watch the real-life moments slipping one after the other on the screen. While watching the movie, and even on post jokes, it's hard to believe that amazing performance actually stands, performance. Every moment and great cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed to their usual daily lives. Even so, "Apart from that" does not feel like a documentary or television reality, but rather transcends into a categorical, own and unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continues with other films by director Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen.
