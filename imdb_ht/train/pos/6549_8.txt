Taking old history stories poses a challenge for the production team, how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to take a new audience while vibrating memories of its former audience. In my opinion, the missions have been fulfilled. A must see for teenagers, pre-adolescents, adolescents, and parents. OK has a couple of moments that are resolved in short order but parents and children should sit securely, the movie moves on the best thing. I'm going to go with these ricky user reviews showing Emma Roberts giving us a positive role model for young women, not syrup on it either. Nancy balances her females and her career skills. A lot of love here, laughing, does not take it too seriously, a real mystery to solve (one you can know yourself as an added bonus, and interesting characters.Nancy Drew even makes a good movie date in my opinion .
