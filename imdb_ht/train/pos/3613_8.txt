When "Girlfight" came out, reviews were praised, but I did not get around to see it. I finally saw it when it was released on video, and I understand the glowing reviews. The movie opens in a high school among a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has a bad-ass expression on his face, and any ideas about Diana that we might derive from this expression will soon become comfortable when he gets into a fight. As Diana gets into trouble for this, we then meet his father, an aggressive kind of his own right; Clearly, we can not totally blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought to germinate in Diana's mind: Boxing as a way to save this thin existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely will not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> Just the first few minutes alone identified I was in for a very fearless, non-Hollywood movie, but the short appearance of John Sayles in a supportive role really claimed. Even before reaching any boxing scene, you feel like you're getting hit in the face of seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. But when they finally came to the main film's story, there was no turning back. <br /> In all, I definitely recommend this movie. I'll admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to do something in his / her was sort of a stereo clone for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I always thought that they had done a great job with it here. In fact, this may have led to the genre of its AEX. Really good. Too many that Michelle Rodriguez wasted itself in Hollywood movies after this one.
