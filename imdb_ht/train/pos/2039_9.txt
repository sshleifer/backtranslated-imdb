First, I would like to point out that those who criticized this movie have made some blatant mistakes. Anything with a rating below 6/10 is a pronounced nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dream is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing movie effects. The actors are very credible, thinking of provocative narrative and the content graphic and very disturbing graphics. <br /> <br /> There are many mystics in this movie. Many questions arise as the audience reveals the strange and freakish creature who makes habitats in the rats tunnel rod rat. How did Craig create and what happened to her? <br /> A fantastic movie with a great frost factor. A movie that has many questions unanswered with a movie that needs to be appreciated with others like 28 days later, Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> Look for the most of the fantastic films !!
