First, I did like this movie. He did well by all. <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I hear about people about a surprise end. I did not know anything about this movie going on except a few "gotta-see" referral, but I knew where the plot went in under ten minutes. (I will not mention what's charging me so as not to spoil a good movie for others.) Still, although it seems obvious, I kept watching. It was nice to see how everything was played out, filling in the details and motivation of characters in later stage. <br /> I do not hate it when I guess the finish early in a movie. I only hate him when the road to resolution is aligned with boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Will Smith's screen character is just mayable, even when playing as a troubled character. It's energetic and credible in everything I've seen him do. Seven pounds are another fine performance. Rosario Dawson is a solid scene, showing an original, rather optimistic character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Rosario, if you do not find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes. <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen him lately lately, but what can be just for me. Woody did not have a tremendous amount of time screen, but it sold her jolly, piano-playing, character blind man for all she was worth. Excellent. A little curiosity in research on jellyfish in boxes tells me that his venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pets and plots. <br /> In general, I have recommended this movie not for the scheme, but for some very good performance, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.
