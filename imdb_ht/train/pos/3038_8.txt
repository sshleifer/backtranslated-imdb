Since Douglas MacArthur has affected more human lives ?? For better than any other non-elected Indian president, she deserves a better movie biography. It is not that the "Universal MacArthur" is bad. That's just not all it should have been. <br /> <br /> Strange enough, the potential was there. From the very early "Star Trek" episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the latest HBO films "Something Made the Lord" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has appeared as one of the most expressing human directors of film, a man who can subtly put emotional shadows into his actor's performance and bring the audience exactly where he wants to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both film, and universally widely known fact that the film was "four years of preparation and production." But for all this, "MacArthur" is perfectly enough ... and not much more. The film began in early 1942, shortly before the general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dann O'Herlihy) ?? to run the Philippines to avoid capturing by the Japanese. So, this movie read: <br /> · MacArthur at birth in 188O in a border barracks in Arkansas is still subject to attacks by Native American tribes ?? thus establishing that his remarkable life covers the distance of bows-and-arrows in thermal weapons; He graduated from West Point first in a 95th grade, as he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who earned the Medal of Honor at the Missionary Ridge of the Civil War) on homework in Japan, China and most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · His heroic exploitation of the 1914 evangelization of Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · how it jumps on the trenches of World War II as a mountain goat, often wounding, and encouraging and infatuating speed of the brigade General; <br /> <br /> · His war service as the youngest West Point and most progressive commander; <br /> <br /> · his involvment in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · routing it in the early 1932; <br /> • Its efforts to support a terminal army chief of staff at early 193O; <br /> <br /> · He retired from the U.S. Army to become Marshal Field (!) in the Army of the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · and reactivation of its commission by FDR shortly before the epidemic of World War II. <br /> <br /> All this is omitted in favor of extended legs in MacArthur trying to fight Seasickness while being evacuated by PT pirate ?? So, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of hunting were wounded in "Doug Dugout" ?? and so patent unfounded. The rest of her career is now right: her island-jumps "Hit 'em where are not" campaigns, the fulfillment of her commitment to the Philippines ?? "I'll be back!" The success of his crown, peacekeeping in Japan after war, then the difference in opinion with President Harry Truman (a well-edged Ed Flanders) on the conduct of the Korean conflict has caused them to kick out, and finally, His proclamation to Congress that "the old soldiers simply fade away," after which he did so only. All assets are historically accurate, and all are presented with a lack of expression of comment. Sargent and producers are almost painfully distance themselves from embracing the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions appear noble, let's present as such; if they appear egotistic or bomb, let these concepts register meaningful comments. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert in subtle manipulating his audience again, see Warm Springs ?? The refusal to offer comments appears quite intentional. Historically, which can be laudable, but it almost destroys the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally, there's a sort of "made on the cheap" feel of the movie, as there's "Midway," released at the same time. Both films were relegated to "TV" director Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on "Midway," and both have a make-for-TV-watch. Even Jerry Goldsmith, while perfectly served, misses the subtle substance and the magnitude of his "Patton" theme - is just another way in which a larger-than-life person is memorialized by a very ordinary movie. / There was nothing worthless and pettiness of the man, inarguably; there was also magnitude ?? With love or passion, one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did not have any military commander before he did: he had the peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" ?? like many movie biographies ?? It's a good place to start researching this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.
