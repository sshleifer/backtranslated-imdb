After repeatedly listening to the band CD, I knew I wanted this movie, got it for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan was as charismatic, I can not describe it. I'd heard about it this way, but did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company in this foot. It was incredible. Clips from the Wembley concert are stamped with surrealist designs like nuns gorging themselves in a garden party as Marc Bolan makes some acoustic versions of getting it on, etc. (I still learn the song titles).

It evades the description. <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now I finally found it was on DVD for 2 years, but it's finally in my house .
