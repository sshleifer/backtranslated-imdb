Having Just "Welcome My Home" 23 YR old daughter from a year in Iraq, Camp Anaconda medical support unit, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other vets return to their minds to try to better understand his mentality on arrival and not waiting until after a bad thing happened. Regardless of taking you to the war and peace this film serves as a great start for all Americans to start the recovery of veterinarians returning us emotionally to cancel. The essential statement of the movie is "Take Action" on the issue. Emotional movie film. I would highly recommend this movie to the veterinarian entire family veterans and ask them to follow through with a listening plan to help return Golf Gulf Enduring Veterans' Freedoms. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost a year later & my daughter saw this DVD. Taken into her emotions and actually made a commitment to re-up for another 6 years. It took over the time he spent in the sand is that he did some good. Children's local children have received first medical treatment for various common disorders that can not normally be paid with an escort and translator. Look at her shoulder in her Iraq journey. "We have changed hearts and minds back" Great DVDs must keep an open mind and view everywhere
