A brutal depression script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good places to shoot in Ohio may be fine movie films on hard times in the rustbelt. As the mills are closed and labor unions disappear, the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in her role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. Look if you can recognize John Goodman before putting weight. <br /> <br /> The metal heavy metal - was someone who made a pun? - is, at times, obscenely annoying, but the movie by Frank Stanley is knockout, particularly the mill stages.
