If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD, it was probably 'Delirious' you were looking for. How often do you laugh when watching up comedy routine? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his older years, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy '' Delirious' and 'Raw' (not as funny) I never knew where Eddie got a great part of his inspiration. Now that I am older, and I see both Pryor and many of the comedies after Murphy, I realized two things: STEAM everyone from Eddie, while Eddie LOVINGLY BORROWED from Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful ?? and more. It was something that never happened before. It was all we needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but once upon a time it was the king, and 'Delirious' was the greatest mansion ever built. Surely one of the funniest routines of all time.
