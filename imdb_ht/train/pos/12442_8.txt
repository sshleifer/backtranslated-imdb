Shot on an impossible schedule and there is no budget to talk about, the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect, certainly more true to Peter O'Donnell's books and comic strips than the previous films. You can read the strip right now from the Titan Book, or in Monthly Comics. It is one of the greatest adventure adventure ever. The film is not great, but unlike the lowest budget film it makes the most of what it has received and keeps your interest. On DVD expenses, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is obviously stoned, is a fuel. Some people were flawless to Tarentino to associate his name with the movie, but without him he would never have been. He is a modest Blaise fan, and he has chosen a good writer and director. All of this is considered worth 8 stars.
