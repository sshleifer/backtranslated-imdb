This is something new .. <br /> There is a coup and a couple of Irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it. A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to constitutionalized by the private media openly as dictators, mentally unstable, new Hitler, etc. without impact from governmental sides ( like, say, the silence through bullets and other traditional traditional methods). Oh, and still claim to be suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media are happy about their own role in the coup dump on TV after overthrowing the government with the help of General Rouge (how much more stupid you can get ??). <br /> And see how the people of Venezuela walk through the palace, holding the constitution at hand, and reinstating their elected governments. <br /> This sounds like a Hollywood leaf, but it happened to be real, against the explicit wishes of the USA. The documentary is a historic castle, shotgun in the action center, acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: good, democratic, freedom of love, benevolent USA (which still channels large amounts of Chavez 'political opponents) <br / > Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
