I've spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I loved it so much we bought the VHS and enjoyed it ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot has been well-discussed, so there is no need to go on it again. The point is this film deserves to look repeatedly. Americans, especially, will not find all the jokes first time around. I know I did not. <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes toast the toast of his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-induced. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as she tries to kiss her, she's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: it's as good as any movie band I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room of "all over the world." <br /> <br /> Each performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has justified congratulations on his painting of Ray, a man who had only one trip too much. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who carries a torch for Karen all the years. She has a hangdog look to appeal that women want to embrace her. But all the actors are even glossy. <br /> <br /> Ignore any pan you read about this movie and see it. It's a gem.
