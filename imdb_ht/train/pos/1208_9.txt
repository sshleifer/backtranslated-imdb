Each kid has films that he popsi in VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was my movie. <br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it at least 100 times, and I can say it's a good kids / movie movie. > <br /> I still have the tape, I did not watch it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around it this week and be a kid for the day. <br /> just have to love the bear, beard and messege care. <br /> <br />
