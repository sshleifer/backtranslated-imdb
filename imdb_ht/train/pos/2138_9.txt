This film turns as much Japanese as it makes life a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is infinite for people over 7 (mostly in public) so that all those who bend instead to embrace even when you are close friends / family. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and in public too! Never the ballroom dancer is (well on) quite popular. People performing Ballroom dances in Japan have seen a bit like nudists in the west ... many more would like to do, but are inhibited by the culture. A delightful family movie, which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I guess the Japanese are just like the rest of us - they love to be hugging too.
