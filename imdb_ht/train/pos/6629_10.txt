The best treasure island ever made. They just do not make movies <br /> like this again, or ever. No one likes film like this. More <br /> <br /> than a gift, this movie is funny, Frank and Fascinating, yet Moody, <br /> Mysterious and Morous. This is one of my favorite photos. The principal must have some idea what it's all about, but it's <br /> <br /> certainly leave room for your own impressions and interpretations, while leaving little to let the imagination. Why it <br /> has not made more films like this, I have no idea. While <br /> <br /> remind me of some of the best, it is one of a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not for the lazy or simple.
