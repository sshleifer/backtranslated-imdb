I love the Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is such a great actor and is Billie Piper !!! Who else likes Do Thorp in pieces ??? It's so nice, is not it? I hated the bits where he was taken by the devil and where he said "go to hell", as Rose so suddenly put him. Remember, it was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, you'll be? Close!". Mr Jefferson was so brave, did not he? Dead to save others. I felt really sorry for Toby (Does Thorp) when he was out of possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared. I was like "Oh my God if I was Rose I would be so frightening for him". But when she embraced her I was like "grrrrrr, she's me! But cut!" but I thought it was really sweet. And physician .... well, I thought he would tell Ida "says Rose I love her" but she did not. Oh well.
