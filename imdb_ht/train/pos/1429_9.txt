I loved the EARTH way to do. Its photography is incredible, its correction must have been an exciting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition its music and sound editing will look at EARTH a profound experience you do not want to miss. You really are on a trip where you would probably never end in mind. I was quite surprised by the laughing at the audience as we saw the daily battles of survival, I could not help laugh myself sometimes. Nature simply seems too impressible to understand. <br /> But rather than the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question: "How 200 years of industrial revolution could destroy the natural system that was here for thousands and thousands of years?" With that question In your mind, you will understand how I felt a bit bitter and powerless after seeing the ground. I felt immediate need to change the world, to help these animals in their struggle, to reduce the changes we have made in the last century and to stop the global warming at once (all that is not a NGO activist !) ... so I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I was able to do to save our planet-our culture-and the polar bear out of its depressing fate .. (www.loveearth.com) <br /> I was a little disappointed that I did not find direct answers to my questions. But it was very interesting to find out more about the movie and its crews went on. <br /> I hope that off energy-use I will do. I do not know how else to reduce the polar bear bears have to swim to reach their ground before they drown or attack animals they can not beat in their exhausted state ... <br /> An inspired film it is, but I did not leave the movie very happy.
