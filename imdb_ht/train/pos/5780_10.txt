The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightweight camouflage as a strange-outherto story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in a city that is unsafe, dog and crime, and she and everyone she knows have a lot of work problems. Maxx is his friend and client, a street bomber who thinks he is a superhero costume - or is it the other way around? The Maxx does not have to be missed for artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly early Barry Stigler's urban, drippingly evil voice of the main villain, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, do not miss it.
