Although it's certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drink, there's such a Dudley Moore portrait of Lovable Lovable, Arthur Bach one can not help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. How can you not be entertained by what's infectious and gloomy and serious breakthroughs? Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, she's really excellent as Linda Marolla and I could not picture anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the movie and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and that great melody "Arthur's Theme", wow. Surely this was one of the best comedies in the 1980s. Great movies get better with every look and that is the case with "Arthur."
