Giallo fans, looking for this movie is rare. It is well written, and full of all the usual types of populated films. I do not want to give anything away, so I usually say about the plot. The movie all creates a very rare atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw to get this movie in English is from European waste cinema, for $ 15.
