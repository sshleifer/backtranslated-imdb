This movie is stunningly beautiful. The Goldsworthy art really beneficial and medium film because you can see the art of its most beautiful, moving and changing with flowers. I recommend this movie to everyone. I can think of nothing else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you've seen, because it's visually compelling and letting me much refresh when I left the theater.
