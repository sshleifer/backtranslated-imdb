A priest who abandons his ministry meets a young man who was just ordered. <br /> This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a lifetime dedicated to God and faith and a more enjoyable life on earth. In France's post war it is also about the aspect of mortal faith itself. <br /> <br /> This can not be the movie of a life but it is a sin to allow it to fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
