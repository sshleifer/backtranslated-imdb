This film is very hilarious, and it has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy who still has this kind of role, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is a very good actor who shows his comedy work at Brother Cohen's brother "O brother, where are you?" which results to be one of my favorite movies ever! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood", here in Mexico. My city is lacking good place to buy some good movies. I tried to buy it in blockbuster but they do not know it by the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find if I have the name given to it in Mexico, to somebody know it?, Because I can do not remember! Cheers. A.
