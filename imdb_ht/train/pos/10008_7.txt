You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself at the foot lately and all these dummy comedy he has made this decade (and perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy", which bombed when he came out , but is now a classic cult). The drama he performed recently was fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "A Picture Hour". "Listen to the Night", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among its best works, periods. <br /> This is a very chilling story, though it does not include a serial killer or anyone physically dangerous for this matter. The concept of the film is based on a current case of fraud that still has to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered terrible abuse and eventually deals with AIDS. I was moved by the story until I read online reports that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this film, confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly described resurfaced in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also gives her best dramatic performance as finally the "caring" sociopath. His role was a far cry from what he had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There was even time he looked at the camera where I thought he had set right in me. He took a good actress to play that kind of role, and it's this redesigned (yet well-reviewed) role that made Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation was not even nominated for awards Academy (as in 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and she's scared too. This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Prepare to be unsaturated, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
