Emilio Miraglio of the "Red Queen killed seven times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I've ever seen, mixing all the components needed in one true disaster. First of all, and of paramount importance for me, it has a complex, sad scheme that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer here does not come completely out of the left corner of the end. The story, about a series of murder victims (you already know how many of the movie titles, right?) Which takes place in progress seems to be an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, one involving, and the murderer , a red-cloaked face and the crazy laugh of a madwoman, is both scary and memorable. Each big giallo requires some nice actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, headed by the Barbell Bouchet ridiculously beautiful as one of the two sisters and, in one of his earlier roles, Sybil Danning, as a vagabon at Barbara's fashion house. Another ingredient needed in a superior giallo is a note, nevertheless, and Bruno Nicolai giving one to this movie that should stay with you for days. Gorgeous scenery? Check again. Filmed widely in Wurzburg, Germany, the picture is a treat for the true eye. OK, OK, but what about murder? After all, is not that gialli all about? Well, I'm happy to report that most viewers should be quite satisfied with the various customs, shooting, impalements and other carnage that this film is nicely ... not to mention the Crypt, sequel to freak, rat and stick (and Many of them, too!), The drug references, a rape scene, the binding red herrings, and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a leading dog for the female viewers. As I said, a perfect jealousy. And even better, this DVD is in the fine way of No shame, and you know what that means: a gorgeous impression and loads of expenses, in boots! Thanks, guys!
