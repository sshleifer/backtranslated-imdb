The case of that scorpion is a very stylish parrot directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a second giant master only in Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-lavish, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and fun mystery mystery. It also makes sense to the end, a big plus, 'this cause is not always the case for these giallo, as they tend to stretch credibility with the endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions. Here, less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The largest brands feature here are the beautiful cinema, the catchy music note, the gorgeous women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black spotted gloved and clear sex scenes in the name of a some. <br /> <br /> In most parts of her decent act, Goerge Hilton usually suits her self and others make fairly well. Martino directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific series. <br /> <br /> If you are a giallo fan, this is a must see. If you like good writing excuses and thrills in general, this comes highly recommended.
