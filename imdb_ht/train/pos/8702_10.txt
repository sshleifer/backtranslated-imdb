A woman's wife in this world and she was alone. They both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one pack - he could remove the sword from his arms. There was still a wound on her wound in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadly weapon inside of her body. First he killed his stepfather constantly drinking his mother's mother every time. Then he grew up and decided to find his real father. Just as simple as all the time for a superhero - it comes to justice .... but the society decides that this is not necessary and dangerous is really right 'cause it's not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try killing anyone - Sasha (he is the main hero acting by Artem Tkachenko) kills if people in his opinion deserve to die, but he gets blamed from the authorities and runs. In such a runaway from authority and Mafia she meets a girl (acting by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else is to look ... not said. You should know that this film is more about feelings and emotions, but not about action. This film is filled with pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.
