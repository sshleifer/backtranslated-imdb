I consider myself a bit of a cinema boxer connoisseur and as such there is one thing that prevents me from calling "Mr. Jim" to the best boxing ever made. This is the Wise Robert / Paul Newman shouting film "Someone has got to love me." This film might be number one, but "Mr. Jim" is a number 2. <br /> The film is not just chronic increase in James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing in a critical time in the transition. By the late 1800s boxing moved away from the brutal days of iron-knuckle rule the more "Gentlemanly" days of the Marquis, Quequarrians of the Queensbury regulation. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptable and respectable. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Jim" is not a realistic look in those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But it's always delightful. Errol Flynn perfect as "Gentleman" Jim that really is not a "gentleman" at all, but simply a fast whiteness from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match at the end). John L Sullivan's "Gentleman Jim" (with the famous PA line "I can lick anyone in the world" of course ... romanticism yet) but on his belt in Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes of any sports move ever made. Realism? No, but wonderful. Hey, if you want to realistically watch "Row Bull" instead. This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Mr. Jim" is a lot more fun.
