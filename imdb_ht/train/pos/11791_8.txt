This is a very intriguing film short by David Lynch, saying David Lynch's name is probably enough for a lot of people. This is your typical Lynch short. A blonde with a brunette in a black room. The blonde was crying, the brunette talking in a way to blond the blonde, and that's about it. <br /> With a lot of silent moments, but with the haunting music from Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This brief feels a little like 'Mulholland Dr', a movie I liked, and that's why I liked this one too. It is probably especially for Lynch fans but there is a chance you like this.
