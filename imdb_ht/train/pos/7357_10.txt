OK where I start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was noisy. James Cahill made himself. Initially after a first look I was disappointed that I did not see it on the silver screen. However this was before exploring the many DVD features !!!! Oh, my god Jakes Cahill in the movie comment was almost as impeccable as his acting. he said in the secret industry used in the film that you only get and experience. <br /> I was so impressed by the other actors. The scene where the security guard speaks to the girl in the hallway, reminds me of some of my favorite (pornographic) movies. I certainly and Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment and has no end. <br /> I'm still bleeding away with every look at martial arts skills involved, matching only by signing the location of the library at school ... and possibly the guy playing a retard! All in all a timeless classic and the best movie out of Europe in years! where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
