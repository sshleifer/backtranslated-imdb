Well, I'm a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says about here that this is the worst! But it's NOT !!! No you see Freddy's Revenge ??? WTF! That was the worst of all !!! Now this film is very decent and it sticks to the Freddy story and it's cool that she has a daughter etc. etc. <br /> <br /> then I found out she was in 3- D! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it on the DVD DVD set immediately jumping in the 3-D sequences. Both a lot were in 3-D same as Lisa Zanes's hands, Demons Dreams, Freddy's claws (more than once), Lezlie Dean holds a knife, Lisa Zane and a baseball bat but Doc's, Freddy's head explodes . <br /> <I really like this movie because it was at 3-D, but I wish the movie was all in 3-D by just 15 minutes past. <br /> <br /> By the way it's 15 minutes NOT DOING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
