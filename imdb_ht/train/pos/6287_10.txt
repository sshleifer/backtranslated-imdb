Going into 60 seconds is a very good movie actress action that has made over $ 100 million but has been dubbed by most critics. I personally thought this was a great movie. The story was credible and was probobly cast in greatest ever for this type of film including 3 award winners academy nicolas cage, robert duval and the very hot anjolina jolie. Other than the lame cascade at the end of this is a perfect mix of action drama and drama. my score is **** (from ****)
