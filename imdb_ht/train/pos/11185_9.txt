As this happens in one of her favorite novels, I was very excited to see the move. I was not disappointed! Yes of course there is a few things that I could pick on, but I think that the movie stuck true to the book, and it was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King film mostly finds a bad review, but this is one of the good ones. It's like a dark story, which I guess why I love it .. and what's better than the dying comes in life .. and something about animals returning from the tomb is also crawling. If you've seen the movie make yourself a great favor and now read the book !! It's a good writing screen, the actors could do a better job (I just say that for Rachel, and Ellie .. it was so whinny) I loved everyone else .. and most importantly to me. It is true with the novel.
