Nick Nolte provided an excellent performance in the story of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until the faction contingent wants to dig past. Like many of Vonnegut's works, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own goals. Nolte is fantastic - self sure and trust as the Campbell is smaller, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to thank for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
