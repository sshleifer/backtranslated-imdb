This show was fabulous. It was complicated and well written with all the characters where likable and out were horribly sweet. Even Jonathan's boyfriend philandering cake was unmatched. Since our waves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not so much soap opera. It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next. It's really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little and have it thrown out because of some mysterious numbers that most of us do not even pay attention. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be missed perhaps not by a lot of people, but some fans are very loyal.
