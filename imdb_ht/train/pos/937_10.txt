At that time initially revealed in 1984, my wife and I were recording her on our first VHS archives. I still have that aging tap, which I try to look every year. It was the first year I was born, and seeing a Christmas Carol of this incarnation brought back fond memories of happy times - many hours of that happened and this movie is playing in the background. I finally broke this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this short reaction in the movie. Charles Dickens' story is captured in exceptional fashion here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and totally credible as Scrooge. Thrust in support is equally spectacular. This is, in my mind, an impeccable production. Little details add much to the fun. Scrooge's nephew's "similes" game and play wife and party guests are a neat item. (I've since re-creating it with my English high school students as a brief respite of class work!) Honestly, I can think of some ways to entertain myself about the holidays I enjoy more than livestock in this CBS production , which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old and original IBM adapters that show just how many computers have evolved in 21 years. Amazingly, things have changed!) A Christmas Carol is a story timeless, and this upscale is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless you, each one!
