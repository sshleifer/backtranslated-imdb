"Bell books and candles" recently showed up on cable. Did not see it for a while, we decided to take a look at this comedy. Based on the hit James Broadway James Broadway, a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer at Fifty Soldiers earlier, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned to play in a fun comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb, the big problem seems to be pairing in the two stars, who collaborated on "Vertigo", released the same year. Audience film did not think anything about the age difference when this movie was released. In fact, most of the star boys stars of this period have always been involved with younger women. The movie set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy with viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as she's clearing the camera worship she does not matter what she's playing. As the witch who gets human, Gillian is good. James Stewart, who plays Henderson's Shep's musicians, is also seen in his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who showed in here why he was at the top. <br /> In supporting Elsa Lanchester's wonderful role, playing Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as it proves here. Jack Lemmon Nicky Holroyd, brother Gillian, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as Sidney Radlitch's writer. This is an excellent way to spend a winter night in the house watching Bell Bell and Candle.
