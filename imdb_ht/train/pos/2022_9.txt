My only complaint about adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that only hinted at in the novel are shown on screen for some strange reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they did not show everything out-right? Other than that, this is very good quality. All the actors perform wonderful works to bring their characters into life. For women to land deep, it's worth to look at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have a good idea I always got the minute I watched her ... <br /> <br /> Sort of a beke - The end scene is a funny glass of what was pass through the book.
