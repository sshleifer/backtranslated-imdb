I enjoyed every moment in this beautiful movie and was intrigued by this pent girl I've never heard of before. So I set out to explore his life and work later. As expected, I found that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was a bit surprised however by commenting very negative about the movie because of this infidelity. Come on, guy, a movie is not and it should not be a biography (or a novel!). Any cultural film historical fact, because it should be a work of art in its own right. A movie director is completely allowed to use elements of reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a beautiful movie and I think it brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
