Playing the Shakespeare has a way of transient time. The language somehow breaks the time barrier. but maybe it is the actors who really do. <br /> <br /> After the deception of Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), hesitated to take on another modern pronoun in Shakespeare. Othello my surprise was great! <br /> <br /> Played Iago characters by the fellow Kenneth! As Iago is really wrong and jerk, the character has played well that he does so shakespeare intended for the charater to be, a pleasure for the hate audience. I must say that the fishburne performance here was really good as well. <br /> I recommend this to students with Shakespeare students and lazy (who refuses to read the book) alike.
