I will not lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time, and I was a bit bored of the scenes slowly. South (the slug) is not all that complimentary, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good at the movie. The animation is exceptional, and the story has a touch end. It is worth taking children 10 and below, but adolescents would probably get it a bit boring tad. Also, the uniqueness of their characters is so interesting. As I said, it is a very good movie, but I would rate the "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
