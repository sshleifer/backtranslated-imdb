Even though structurally totally different from the book by Tim Krabb√© who wrote the original "The Disparate" (Spoorloos) makes it even feel general, except for Koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyrical. The beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is at the end. A surprise end up emotionally. As you could read in several magazines there are some sex in the movie, but it is all very beautiful. Never explicit, but very hot and sometimes even humorous. It is an American film movie can not as open a honoust as this one. Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to the topic, 'De Grot' remains still within the boundaries of good taste. 'De Grot' tells an amazing story stretching over 30 years. When leaving the movie you will move. What can we ask for more in a movie? Anyway, this movie even gives more.
