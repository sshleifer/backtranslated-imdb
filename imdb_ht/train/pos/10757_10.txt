** Warning! Small Spoilers before! ** (Yes, I realize it's hard to spoil a historical documentary, but I'm revealing some of the backstory and methods.) This is an outstanding documentary not only because of the remarkable footage, but also due to the story behind it. Because the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9/11, but rather in a rookie firefighter, the men's emotions and the viewer's connections and they are more real and powerful than they should be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a sense of filmmaking, "9/11" is the book. If the events were a current script, they would be superb, as the characters set, then send a curve to be reactivated. This is all the more amazing to consider the pain and emotion of the raw footsteps that the directors walked through this story piece together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station; Specifically, how a rookie assumes itself in a veteran crew. This alone part is quite good, and the documentary has been allowed to run as it intends, it probably would be solid. The fees appear to showcase the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell break loose. This chaos after the WTC attacks is clearly seen, as various characters that we have known are violated in dire situations. Watch not only the attacks, but also the first reaction but is a very moving picture of human emotions. The consequence, in which firefighters discovered to be lost and found, is human drama at its peak. Life and death hang in the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who lives and dies but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> Only the negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro (whom I love) blurbs was uninformative, unnecessary, and did not advance the story at all. They have probably added just to attract more TV TVs. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: the best documentary I've ever seen. Nonparal portraits of human emotions and human dramas. 9.5 out of 10.
