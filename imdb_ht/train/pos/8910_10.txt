Most atomic monster movies I've seen on television as a kid- and some of them, the BLOB included, awesome daylights are outta me. Movies like invaders from MARS made it all too clear to our "little fry" that just kids did not have to be trusted when it came to things like things that invaded Homeworld; The BLOB just repeats that fact. I remember, lovingly, late evening spent stretched on the floor looking like Body Snatchers and martian invaders and seeped spots in an unsuspecting society. There was a summer, early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran a classical Atomic class every weekend. These were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the nozzle projector), and the "color" printed in the BLOB was faded in a pink butchery - but, man, it was fun. I drag my mother together, and she liked it as much as I did. He was there, at that science museum, that I really fell in love with the BLOB. The intention of the cinema was, of course, to make money - but it was sincerely at all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), which made me fall in love with this movie. Corny? You bet. Cheesy? No cheesier found. But people, what a movie!
