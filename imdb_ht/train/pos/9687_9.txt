A pale parrot is not a hugely imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant film, which is fun in the whole family. It manages to bridge the garbage difference between severity and severity during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all events in the film lead to a largely satisfying conclusion. Animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads her wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should be more successful, though this film was not a highlight in 1998, unlike Ryan's Private Saving. This hour and a half will surely be one enjoyable and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and exciting one - from the moment it is first seen at the moment it is united with its original owner, you will enjoy after him and watch her learn about friendship with the gloomy realities of life along way. No one should miss if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10
