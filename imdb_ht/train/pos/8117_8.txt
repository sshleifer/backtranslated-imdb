The first time I saw this film 40 years ago on TV N.Y., and she thought it was a depressive look of the future. Wells sees the restriction of privacy as a good thing. ("no private aircraft." 30 years more war in the film was the reason that this movie has not shown British movie newspapers to make the concept war in the future, and Korda's a concept of the future cars are the real stars of the movie. The best performance performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina come from fabulous fabulous fabulous series. It's interesting to note that Boss's negative personality is a bit similar to the Churchill time war.
