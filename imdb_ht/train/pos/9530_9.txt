Conrad Hall comes out with a bang. The great photographer film ends her illustrious career with this movie before you pass on. He made himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see. <br /> Of course, the act is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman play their drive! The number of shares in here is just right, too: not too much; not too small. <br /> None of the characters in here, frankly, are "good guys" as Hanks are a professional hit-man for the boss of Newman. Hanks' only good quality is not wanting her son to wind up a killer like him, although he taught him how to be the next person in flight! Huh? <br /> As good as the act is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this movie is Cinematographer Hall, who painted scenes after beautiful scenes with her lens. His job is just scary.
