The man in the White suit is one of these delightful comedies that Ealing study has done well in the 40's and 50's. The plot of this one follows a man who invented a piece of cloth that does not become room or break. Of course, this is a great tool in the world of textiles. However, things are not as simple as the fabric will threaten the way to life of many people, including fabric fabrics, workmills of the cloth cloth, and even an old lady who does wash weekly. The man in the White suit is a film about scientific progress, and ways that are not always helpful; As the old woman says in a point in the movie, "Why cant you scientists just left things alone?" Like a lot of Ealing comedy, this one star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; He has the ability to light the screen and his presence (and it does in this movie, literally), but it also manages to show his character in a down-to-earth and credible manner. It is decently creepy in this film, and it captures just the right atmosphere for her character; An intelligent and ambitious scientist, but a little naive. Together with Guinness, the Man of the White Costume also features Joan Greenwood, the deep-acting actor expresses that co-starred with the Guinness simply Wine "Heart Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would go to find herself the role of Alfred in the Batman films. Acting in the movie is not always great, but it's still decent, and it's adapted to the movie. The man in the White suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and funny comedy with a moral. The comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the movie does not mean to be a movie that provokes laughing belly, so that is forgiving. I recommend this movie, basically, for anyone who is a fan of movies.
