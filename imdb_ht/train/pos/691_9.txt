I'm going to be clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor in my. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought he was going to do ... different, maybe in not such a good way. <br /> But I was wrong. After reading some revisions came out on this short, I was actually excited about seeing it. I was sent for my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an ensnare who is often plagued by the conditions that cause him to doubt what is the reality, and what is all in his head. I will not give away what's happening, but I'll tell you that the movie can sometimes scare its realism. <br /> <br /> The report is fantastic, focusing on what's essential in the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments. <br /> In all, I give this great movie 9 out of 10, to go beyond what I thought any shortcut might be achieved.
