That really is a great movie. Some of the songs became classic immortal and danced by Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger films are the same. After the song and dance is over, it's the other characters in the movie that performs the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His novels with Harriet Hilliard and the subcommittee of the film are the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds in this movie, he does not detect from it. He has a personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten list of favorites. It's great to see it as something other than a cowboy. OK, so it's not really a big actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. It was very likable and can climb to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred's movies and the generation had sub plots that depend on other actors to fill in the space between the music numbers, otherwise the film should be shortened by about half an hour. I just want more people to appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.
