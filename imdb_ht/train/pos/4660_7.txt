"Miliono Hot" is a well-written, well-behaved story about a stolen embezzler (whoops! - too low a word for an embezzler, according to Peter Ustinov's lead character) a "hot million dollars" at the London branch an American corporation does not create corporation shell on the continent and using the computer officially computer security to transfer money. (Remember, spoiler fonts, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) Since 1968, this movie depot in computers may seem naive of the more computer-literate population today; but as someone who has worked with computers since before this film was released, I would assert that even then, this smacks of them were written by and for illiterate computers, probably on purpose to increase this comical aspect British flick. <br /> <br /> If one little taste for this kind of entertainment, the movie may seem to steer in spots. Fortunately, it has a nicely finished wrap-up; Unfortunately, the credit ends by giving any indication of the classic music used by it - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano-flute Duet in the middle - just singing this song by Lulu which I totally do not remember.
