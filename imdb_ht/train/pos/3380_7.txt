I saw tons of science fiction from the 70s; some evil spirits, and others thought provoking and really scared. Soylent Green fits in the letter category. Yes, at times it's a small camp, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the movie seems awfully prescient. Here we have a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, which is imagining the future as somthing black, scary, and nihilist. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson fare best in this than the Ten Commandments, and the Robinson suicide scene is creepily prescient in Kevorkian and his ilk. Some of the attitudes are dating (you can imagine a movie staring away with the "women as furniture" concept of our O-so-politically-correct-90s?), But it's rare to find a movie from May Decade which actually can make you think. This is one I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a widespread presentation, I do not think all the dimensions of this movie would get it due. Look at that.
