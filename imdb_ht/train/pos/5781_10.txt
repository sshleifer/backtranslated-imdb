"Most of us at least live the world, the real world where we are in the mercy of circumstances and the world of, the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr .Gone introduces inside the world to the "Maxx" a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined. Inspired by the comic books of Sam Kieth, the "Maxx" is very loyal to the material of what it has inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which looks like the pages of the comic, This shows a surreal and unique appearance. However, the story it's interesting and fun .At the moment it might turn too weird, but when you got inside it, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are beautifully developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the proper atmosphere. Unfortunately, as many good animated shows, this one was short - alive. "The Maxx" is a must see. It's one of my all-time favorites.
