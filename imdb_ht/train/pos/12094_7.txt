The bloody castle is a good example of the quality work of genre of horror being turned out to Italy in the 60s. The film has all the right elements - old black houses, atmosphere, a decent history, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most all movies worth seeing. <br /> The story concerns an Haunted Mansion. People have been visiting, but no one has returned. Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his scatter. But the night she visits is a special night. It is the night each year when the deceased returns to revive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the movie is the time to run. She almost feels pervasive. There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero is breaking around in the dark without finding anything in their interest. But once he finds something, the movie picks up, it gets quite enjoyable. The bloody castle is a definite must for fans Steele and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
