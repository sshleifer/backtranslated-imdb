This was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released. Some movies do not get older but this is clearly out of date. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for over twenty years both the images as the story was unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. Actually, I remember this movie as subject to several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about the things we have in common. Therefore, there was a little feeling of disappointment and even sadness when we finally was the DVD. First, there was a theory about how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would anticipate that this film has something to be interesting for all the modern movie makers, especially those who focus on the rotten horror genre. This is the mutation, the idea that gives the movie spouse; The reality of a human being has threatened to produce a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how bad the sensation was, when the monster ripped Kurt's arm out. And in the end; When the animal bites the doctor's body, he takes a piece of the vein. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prioritizes without rotting through the intensity of all the scenes, no matter if the action is on a secret laboratory, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a dressing room, and so on. That is why why not longer a good movie are just things techniques. For example, at the scene of the accident and the man saving his fianc√© head to a more accurate job, made for another and modern second unit directors might be interesting. The same thing with all action scenes, including one of Kurt's arms. In addition, something can do with the monster make up. Some remarks were good; I think in this case an attempt would be worth while. But the tones of black and white should be preserved.
