I saw this film three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The act is amazing, which is not hard to believe it is Daniel Jou Lewis, who is an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is surprised at it, though. It captures your heart as a mother with a physical handicap, who can not walk, or talk until it's late teens. <br /> I can not say enough good about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies based on current events, or just enjoys good playthroughs in general.
