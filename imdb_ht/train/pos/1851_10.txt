This film was seen in August of the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Association of Milwaukee, YES, it's the first public screening. The movie is GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful like Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. Fisher's real resident did a good job writing and Denzel's direction is right on the money. See it open weekend. You will not be disappointed.
