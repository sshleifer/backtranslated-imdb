I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Award for Books in 1978 and is a very attractive to it (not intended). It's not too difficult for it to be outside those who are not often afraid of it! The book seems to take the passion in their relationships more than the movie and the movie makes more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and movie. Very few Australian female writers were around in the 70's therefore very much documented how to live for a woman in a city town in Australia during this era or class. It is a precious piece of Melbourne history. It's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80 pornographic film. It's far from that and as the review has mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what the movie is about at all. Those who rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember this movie was born in 1982, so do not expect the Hollywood about dramatization that seems to incorporate these days. This is what I love about it. It is also great to see Hazlehurst's Noni in this role, it's just fantastic as Nora and it's great to watch it really act, so if you're close to my age, you'll better remember it for him on playschool and Best Home and Gardens. Who knew he hides this talent? This film will give you an entirely new impression on it. An Australian classic story!
