Despite the title, the sword bearer, and the DVD cover (action / herioc poses in the sword bearer) this is not a super hero movie. (Minor Spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, Sword Bearer, who is cursed and has a retractable sword in his forearm. Cool you say, but no, this is real life. If you had this power as a child you can control it when, say, faced by a fool, or when your mum boyfriend is beating him. But if you do not control it, how you deal with being a killer of time at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Lose victim after another kill (much like One Bout of Souffl√©). She then satisfied Katya, and the couple fell immediately in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try and change his way. However, his past constantly chased him, in the form of police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story, and there are virtually no action on the screen, though many are suggested. <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood movie 'super heroes', we get lots of little stories back, no bad guys (unless you count the sword's sword) abut has a lot of heart and good character development. Worth check out if you can find it.
