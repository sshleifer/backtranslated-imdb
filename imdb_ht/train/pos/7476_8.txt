I really can say I felt the movie in its essence where the toys themselves come from the reality of dreams into the future surprise aspect by Tom Cruise. I did not care much about Tom Cruise's ability to act but I must say that it seems impressed at every point in the movie ... not simply due to a storyline engaging, but also due to his own character being indicated Lead .. ..they gets in and then speaks to her beautiful. However I must say that this film does not come under the "weekend films" that you choose random and look gleefully; It brings strong feelings and characters by washing this one down with your beer and pop-corn. It certainly needs more than that.
