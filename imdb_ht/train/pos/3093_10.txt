Why are not the producers provided a chance to all the junk on TV, why not the producers give Six Degrees a chance? Is the series going on video? I would like to see how it ends. Put one season on video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of six degrees and hoped to return it. I place my archive typing all the shows. Thank God for that. I just found that the show was canceled and I broke up. I wish I knew he was going to cancel, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was just developing some depth of the characters. Writing this was also very good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite time ever. I'm sorry to see it go!
