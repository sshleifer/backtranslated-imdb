I was in the screen conference and even saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summarized the movie was over. However, the movie really did not need explanation. I thought the terms were very clear, and inspired. A film that faces the ability to dare, facing fear - especially scared passing down from parental face - and overcoming it, and, in doing so, embracing life's possibilities, is a movie to be scrutinized and savored. I loved it more than the many-hyped 'Somersault.' I also think Mandy62 was a bit wrong against Hugo weaving. As a trap on his ex, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been substandard recently, but 'Peaches' delivers goods. I'm glad I've seen it.
