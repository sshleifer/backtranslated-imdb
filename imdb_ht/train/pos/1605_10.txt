"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I own the movie on DVD! The film deals with a New York widow (Cher) who fell in love with her companion (Danny Aiello) mad brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a baking. I'm pleased to have won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (directed "Fiddler on the roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent film for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
