Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's major directors. This is tender, visually beautiful film based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the ironically black writers' writer. John Turturro provides what I consider to be her finest performance (I usually do not have a fan of it); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Well worth seeing.
