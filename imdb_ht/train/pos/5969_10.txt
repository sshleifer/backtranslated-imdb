This film is sort of a Carrie meets heavy metal. It's about a highschool guy who gets over and he totally revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost. it is like a classic. The soundtrack is a ++++. You've got the legendary Metal Metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must have for metal fans.
