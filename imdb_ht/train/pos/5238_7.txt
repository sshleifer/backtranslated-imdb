I Love Top Gun. He kept my interest. Predictable draw, decent development character and story line. It is very similar to High Midi in that the city people appear weak and afraid to stand a cruel one. This movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all their talents. Also some of the actors did not receive credit for their role. Denver Pyle was a good man in his youngest days. Jan Dehner, Rod Taylor is outstanding in their role. Sterling Hayden did better than he could with poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. It seemed flattering that two men might have been fighting on it. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
