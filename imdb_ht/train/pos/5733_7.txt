I'll point the scales here a bit and say I liked this. However, the design is really only going to appeal to people who are very absurdist. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism. <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is fiery, violent, and stupid. There is no sort of royalty too. Wife's wife and grief, apparently just barely able to be the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories completely miss any point. <br /> <br /> But, again, that's the point;) <br /> If no guides, mobs, and random complement and pronounced are your stuff, you'll love this. <br /> It is really short, so I would probably rent instead of buying.
