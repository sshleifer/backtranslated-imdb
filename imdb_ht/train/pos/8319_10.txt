I was 5 years old when I saw this movie during my vacation with my family in St Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with her. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieving my goals that I have been accomplishing since that time! This tragic story of a hard-core "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, "Sparkle" successfully shows the struggle of three young sisters looking for their seats in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many aspiring young artists about what can be crafted when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available in helping a borrower. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the band brings the plot and all songs. From being subjected to situations that almost left no choice to make long-term decisions, making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young women, Sparkle, Sisters, and Delores, represent the different routes that a person can take when you set out to realize your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie could possibly spawn the ideas of creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's "Glitter," 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I've seen a lot of similarities in both stories of "Sparkle," as well as the "Saturday night night," "Fame," "Flashdance," and breaking off off-Broadway hit "Mama, I want to sing."
