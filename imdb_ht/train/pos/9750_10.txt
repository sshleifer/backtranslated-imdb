Yes, Giorgio, is a good movie feel. A little romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedian, (a good food fight), and a little flavor of the breads are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Any movie movie would like this movie. People who require massive special effects, should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape now and then, and how best to do this, than with a eye for eye, ears, and heart? A must see!
