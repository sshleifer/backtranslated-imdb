Forget the 'religious' movies that monopolize the TV / movie market ... this movie has a real feel of it. While it can be considered a movie with cheap emotional trace, it also has message messages of forgiveness, and overall good moral. However, I did not like the lighting of this film ... for a movie related to these subjects, it was too bright. I felt it was taken in the overall appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the cast recognizable, and the performances to counteract this oversight. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
