It is a very good movie, not only for the fans of comic Lady Death, but also for those who love animated movies / series of adventure and fantasy. The film is about an innocent girl who is about to kill for something she did not do, but for whom she is daughter of the hell of hell, Lucifer herself. <br /> <br /> Then he is seeking revenge ... and the rest you best see in the movie. <br /> I love the movie many, the characters like the original comics, Chaos style. I never had the chance to read the first parts of the story of comics, only the same ones, after the passages of the movie, so I can not tell you if the events are exactly like funny but ... one way or another it's the story of death death!
