Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was a wicked Columbo villain. The first "good" episode of Columbo, following two autonomous pilots, "Kill by the Book" is not far off classic status. Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, a half of a partnership writing a mystery created. His partner Jim is one of the talents, while Ken has no talent other than the gift of the bar and a skill for promoting the books. As soon as Jim decided he did not require Ken's skills, Ken lay a plot to kill Jim. Except it's a new plot, it's actually the real-life application of a murderous storyline originally intended for one of the books. <br /> It does not take Columbo long to work that Ken is the murderer, although unfortunately another murder took place (Ken romance and then killed a key witness) before Columbo has sufficient evidence to secure a conviction . <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with "Kill by the Book", but it's not quite head-tooth. I would just give the "publish or perish" the edge on this: both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "publish or perish" is a more tense and unpredictable fraction. But this is still a great episode.
