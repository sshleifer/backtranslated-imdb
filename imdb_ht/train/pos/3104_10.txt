This movie was excellent. I was not expected to live up to the hype but he did. Like all the movie Bourne action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one too. The film scheme is simple and there is no twisting draw that is too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stiles characters show up in the Italian safe home was kind of far-fetched especially after that happened in Sipremacy but it makes sense that it is the only character of the "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, who does not want it 'dead and could possibly trust with the sole person to lead him in the right direction. The action is driven by the characters and their reaction to what is happening all around them. The thing that I still love about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt, but when matching people as good as it is fighting they struggle and it takes a lot of damage to them. They never treated the audience like idiots. <br /> All actors have been solid in their performance. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and received excellent support from Joan Allen to dump his role in Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie with the trilogy. I miss Franka Potente though.
