Most of the comments were positive but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on their set. The designer employs a lot of beautiful art decorations treatment along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so forth. It's worth paying attention. The movie is driven by character and symbols that are very rich. All the gangster actors have been cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialogue was fun at times, but stilted at times and I suppose it meant to be that way. This movie is a movie movie. It was made by people, for those who love the medium. Do not miss this one.
