Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest film films. I think we can feel all for "Gypo" because we were all struggling with what is right and what is not and was wrong. This was one of the first art-house photographs to be released by a great American movie studio (RKO Radio Picture). The Joseph H. August Community is at its best here. However, August's stunning share was mostly neglected; he did not receive the nomination Oscar worthy of deserving. This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all aiming and as little as possible.
