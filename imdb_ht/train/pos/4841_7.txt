In the colonies we are not all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which had her TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on her appearance of "Ghost Train" - which I hope to be quite annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to get me laughing audibly. The physical aspects of the acting comedy and distribution of it when delivering a suggested line that you would find if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparison to him in Bud Abbott or any of the other usual firefighters of comic relief that turns up in this genre movie. One can feel, in addition, the wireless Internet Connection Askey Connect 30 years later; At least it's clear from an American point of view that it has more in common with Trump's Monty Python than any of her counterparts on here. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you will guess at the finish, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.
