A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj bajpai were given the best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural flair in the movie and I felt it right. It looked like Bollywood finally gave away its glamor and there were some quality artists doing on screen. <br /> <br /> The content of the movie, the movie shows much what exactly happened while partaking does not show the suffering of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion . <br /> <br /> The best part did not make it a drama and a lot of water flow and melodrama. <br /> I simply liked it.
