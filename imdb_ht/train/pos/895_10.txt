I saw this film. This movie is best suited to today's needs. The wedding dot is the biggest problem nowadays. At stating this problem this movie is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are very well-known. Youth today must understand this problem. There are fewer population girls. Due to this problem of dot, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day does not have any little girl, is not far. So keep in mind that this statement, today's youth must understand that we can not take the dot to marry. We need to learn from this film dot should not be taken. But if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in society. This is the biggest change in society.
