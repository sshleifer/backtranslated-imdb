Low budget british pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to have a star, gets one and then finds it all a little too much. Good to throw with a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we were all here before. Several scenes are somewhat hyperlinked and O'Connor's voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse! It disappears in hurry after making this movie - so life can imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star held though.
