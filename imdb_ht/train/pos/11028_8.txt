To be honest, I did not like that movie this time when I saw it for the first time. But I guess the problem is that I have not seen it in a theater. Big mistake! Because the # 1 item seen in Cliffhanger is the setting and # 2 is the cinematography. Try to see this movie on the bigger TV possible with a great sound system. Good music and put the movie to a higher level (with a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best films. This guy knows about action. The Hard 2, kisses in long bite, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effect is great and spectacular. Stallone really needs that film to get back and success. Still good to see him!
