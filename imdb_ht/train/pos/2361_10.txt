I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I also work in an acute medical care center. Over the years I have seen people dying in the bloodthirsty reactions of blood transfusions, they went to many conferences on pathogens without birth, and saw many patients getting sick from pathogen induced by blood transfusions. I also heard many of Jehovah's Witnesses say they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the garden I never actually see it happen, leaving the question, "is it really reasonable to refuse blood transfusions or Does the community benefit greatly from the struggle on this issue? "The Problems of Jehovah's Witnesses Are A Moral. "You must abstain from blood" is not a limitation statement. Thank you for this movie and allow comments about it.
