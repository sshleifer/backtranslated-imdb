this dolph lundgren machine is a fun dead hard throw action action, it will not be to win any awards and it's not very original but it delivers the merchandise you want to see from a lunar dolphin movie. Our man dolphin is an ancient soldier who is now a professor at a high school high school and when he gets caught up by terrorists up to him to save the day. make sure that the script will not be to win any fun Oscars its fun and it has its just action action packages. Dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but it comes alive more in the action scene, and the rest of the cast are not the best actors, but they hold it well. All in all detention is an enjoyable action flick, but you've seen it a million times before.
