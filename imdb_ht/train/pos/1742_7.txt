Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I've seen in the past ten years. Excellent performance (especially yiannis fugally is great), well-written script and effective direction from a very special, for the Greek average standard , authority. A movie, obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's dog, could be a prince if he avoided some obvious and exaggerated symbols and symbols in the end. But this is a movie that deserves our attention and belongs to the rare categories of Greek movies that should look out of Greece. It's a shame that in Greece did not work commercially, in addition to other fakes and cursory big productions such as Politiki Kouzina.
