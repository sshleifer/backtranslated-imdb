Since only a toddler then this show originally revealed me just recently picked up the DVD series and I wanted to have more episodes filmed. This show was a 70s version of the 90-pop TV series "X-Files" - but with a bit more of a comedy / light appeal. But do not get me wrong, some of the episodes are full of horror terms, many of which are some very hungry scheme (leaving the imagination of course- this was the television early 70s). Some of the plots are somewhat silly as well as acting, but this is the charm and attraction of this series. If you like drama crime drugs, comedies, or sci-fi / horror themes, this series has brought all that together. Each episode reveals in about 50 minutes or so (1 hour and advertisement) and that 50 minutes goes by quick still let me want more. A great classic show in my book!
