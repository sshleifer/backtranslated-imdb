It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I do not really like dogs. Fox, gardens, and buffalo make a great job with their voices of luck, sash and shade, and act by the animals themselves are just amazing. <br /> I saw this movie 72 times already (I know that sounds scary, but it's true!), and each time the scenes are still over to me. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially animal lovers. It's all my favorite movie ever!
