I'm so happy I've seen this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem. I liked that the movie, a love story of style, was not about some pretty twenty-somethings; Instead, it's a story of some sixty-somethings, who used to be twenty-somethings. It's a good, well-written, and beautiful story acting with awesome music WWII threw in as well. She also got a delightful surprise to her for Scottish castle lovers. She let me smile and ready to look at her again, which I did a couple more times before I turned her around. I highly recommend it.
