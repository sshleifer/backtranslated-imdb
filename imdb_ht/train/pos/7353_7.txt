This blockbuster 1994 has all its good performance, music and direction.I remember that I was in Allahabad when this movie was running and was somewhere in March In Holi time, those who played her songs "Ooe Amma" in the loudspeakers of higher volume. If someone likes watching some such hot and drools look at Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie.Tumbs up to Govinda. Many of us know that this film was shot in South India and after Sholay was able to make one in very few blockbuter hits Silver Screen. With films like these American comedy can never die.
