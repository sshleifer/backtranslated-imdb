Miriam Hopkins is the "Lady and Red Hair" in this 1940 biopic of Madame Leslie Carter who also star Claude Rain as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Ms. Carter. Rains are great as flamboyant, egotistic producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the great names of theaters. Even though Carter's second wife, Lou Payne, served as a mentor on this film, she's a poor representation of the real events in Ms. Carter's life. True, there was a diverse divorce published with bitterness, and it was undoubtedly considered a scandalous character for that and becoming an actress. However, he had custody of his son Dudley, so there was no guard guards. Once he broke down with Belasco, he did not come back to him, and, in fact, began working in Vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of his life. He was married to Lou, and he became the man who led him to many productions. The driving force for Ms. Carter at the beginning of this film is to regain the guard of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from her, she is well connected with her father, . In the movie too (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theater ride theater, which gives film to some interesting atmosphere. a bad movie, probably not a description of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Madame Carter's most famous moments was Maryland's heart, where she had a wig and six-foot wigs. Off-stage, fans blew her hair while hanging 35 feet higher than the stinging claw to the center of a bell to keep it in ringing. Quite a visual.
