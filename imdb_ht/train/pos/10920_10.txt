I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I do not remember where I saw it. I had to be around 14 years old. I thought the film was incredible and wanted to see it again. He came on Kung Fu's channel once, but I missed it. I was really bummed. It's the best special-Kung Fu movie movie that I've seen on the date! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it once more and for years to come. I also must check this Return to the Venom movie in which some have spoken so very.
