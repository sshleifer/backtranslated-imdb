This is my favorite movie ever. He used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this first movie with my aunt Brent and Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my newest friend. I read a lot of comments on why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy was "learning to act" to marry. But let's come back and watch this for a second time: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight is this on Bud & Sissy's relationship to take a turn for the worst because it made a fool to ride the bullet Gilley. They get in a big fight. Bud tried to make Sissy jealous of asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinking of evil will make a right and Wes asks if "he needs any help". They are all on the dance floor acting mad when Bud asks Pam, "when will you take my home and rape?" Pam replied: "When you're ever ready Cowboy." Bud then goes home with Pam in his condo in downtown Houston. Daddy bought for her oil money and "all that implies". Bud is one of those cheats on Sissy. Sissy waits Bud when he returns home next day. Sisi is one that leaves Bud. Then it's up to Bud to prove Sissy that it's a real "cowboy" and have it back. <br /> <br /> Anyways, this is my interpretation. Everyone has to be sure! I like this movie. <br /> And I believe it or not, I got myself a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
