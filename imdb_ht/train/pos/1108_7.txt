Some of the Altman recognize "heads" seem sad to me now. Maybe I am. Like the latest review, I love this "least" Altman (recently shown on FMC), although I do not think it was targeted at a wide audience. Political organization as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of this "satiric docudrama" is currently dated, such as Dick Cavett watching the show tonight, but I have found plenty of the funny and perspective dialogue (such as "You are for real. That means you do not have no threat to anyone "). The story is not "deep", but I love it. With the funny performances, especially Cavett (as "herself"), Lauren Bacall as a conservative aging figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of the Parliament) as a left wing ideologist (at the opening stage of a dressing person as a carrot on the sacred policy), and Carol Burnett as a basket case. All in the Altman unimproved style, although perhaps not quite as inimitable as usual. But very inimitable.
