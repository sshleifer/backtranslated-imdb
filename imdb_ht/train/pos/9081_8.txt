If you like sci-fi, monsters, and ancient legends, then you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the act can be a little less than desirable, the story line and the well-off effects of it. <br /> I wish now I saw this in the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 thumb screen TV. <br /> If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myths and sorrow ... you must see this movie !!
