If it were possible to distract the heart and soul into the sport - no, the most form - in surfing in its perfect form, this documentary did it. This documentary shows life is not only about the waves, but it's more about the people, pioneers, and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of great surge beyond it ever. Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from my early days' 80s skateboarding as a teenage girl SoCal - was the remake of amazing stockings and footage interviews down to the essence and creating what not just a documentary , but a masterpiece of the genre. When her heart and soul are in the subject - and clearly she is here - her genius is full of a pure vision that does not glamorize, hype, or sensationalize her subjects. It revere surfer with navigation / beach navigation, but does not whit it either. There is a frightening fact of the sport as well. <br /> There are many that would be said about this documentary, about the surfers, the early history of the sport, and surfers are its great wild surge surfers. Greg Noll, the first wave of great pagans who pioneered the sport; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who normally went up alone for 15 years on Great California's great North California sailing; and, the central of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, Mesia today has huge wave of navigation. <br /> There are many forms and warmth among all these guys - and a few girls showing up on camera - with a deep and powerful love for surfing with the ocean that comes in all the words. I found the story of the way Hamilton's father met him and how Hamilton as a little boy or 5-year-old boy practically forced him to be his father especially heartwarming (e, yet , strip of sensual sentimentality). <br /> <If you like surfing - or even if you are not - this is a wonderful documentary that must look, if only because you are a student in the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well-done work in art .
