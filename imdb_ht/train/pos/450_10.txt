I'm partially towards any movie that depicts a bundled picture of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately the film was rather short, very so for a piece of period, with a little spar on aspects of cinematography. However, the excellent story makes up for her. Ms. four engage in a very necessary vacation so they do not have trouble in their minds. During the film, they have achieved their problems and begin to repair them. They believe San Salvatore, the castle to stay in, has a breathtaking effect on people. "It's a love bath," says Lottie Wilkins. You can watch the gradual changes in dissatisfied as exuberant as the Italian sea works its magic over them. <br /> All the problems and solutions are possible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very suitable for a romantic Italian romance. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
