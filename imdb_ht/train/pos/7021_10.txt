I had the pleasure of attending a screening of the Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film has caught my attention briefly while back when I stumbled through an article on it at Jalouse Magazine. It seemed interesting at the time, but there is nothing too interesting. Regardless, I've seen it in the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I have been interpreting when the credit ends are starting to roll. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that I've seen in some time. Photography, artistic direction, acting, and especially directing, were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is 'spelled out' for you in this movie and actually makes you think. Something that a vast majority of today's films make the exact opposite. The dialogue is carefully fabricated and, although this script is not wall walls, the words words are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> It's definitely one of those films that deserve a second look and the more you see it, the more you notice. It's a very coherent and smart movie. Not sure when or where he is playing again, but a definite must be seen for movie enthusiasts.
