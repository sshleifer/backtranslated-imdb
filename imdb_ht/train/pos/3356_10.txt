Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian principals. My parents and I watched together "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we loved it, but we did not like it as we liked "A Special Day". I believe Ettore Scola is very obnoxious: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest movie was disappointing. So, last night, my mum and I sat on our sofa enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, scores and production design were mild and accurate, but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fan of Fascist, has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to get a great family cost. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spent a special day, special day in 1938 when Hitler visited Rome visiting Mussolini. I do not want to hurt again on the draw: go looking for this movie!
