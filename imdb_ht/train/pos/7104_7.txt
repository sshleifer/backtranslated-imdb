Debutant Los is the story of two neighbor who has moved to Santiago from the South after their mother dies. Silvio is confident and the older brother, finding a working job for a sable club owner owner after taking the naive Victor has for his 17th birthday. As Silvio flower under her boss tutelage, both brothers get involved with the sexy mistress and manipulator owner Gracia. As the movie unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle ways and brains that each manipulate the next. The film is well done, with good cinematography and fast paced. It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of stripping and some explicit sex gender scenes. He uses the now-popular technique of stratification different scenes from different points of view, from chronological sequence. Many people hate such movies because they do not understand what's going on - Memento, fake tombs, insect dogs, and many other good films used this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of heat, fiction, and many other good noir films. <br /> <br /> As different layers reveal, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolved. While the plot can be somewhat stereotyped, it is also clever and entertaining. <br /> I would call it an enjoyable movie, worth watching, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many films from Chile, and it is always interesting to see noir films from other countries. Otherwise, rent it if it is available, but do not lose any sleep if it does not.
