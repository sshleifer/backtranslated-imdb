This independent, B & W, DV presents consistently trauma, amaz and amus with its ability to create the most crazy situations and then get humor and interest in them. It's all hilarious and ridiculous things, yet as absurd as much of the movie should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the movie seated, holding the entire piece of drifting in full digging and letting it lie the real message here. This movie is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. Which seems to be the heart of the movie. For the crazy and wall like things found, Leon, 30 years old. old paperboy-protagonist, always trying to keep it together. It is like a child forever trying to hold the balloon that floats away so that everything works out for the better, so that everyone can have what they want. on the top but the outstanding cast really holds the piece itself. Wind Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a bright performance in its absurd tick tick. Just as the characters in the movie do, we neglected around it suddenly to see real people below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. It takes all the ridiculous traits ridiculously ridiculous and keeps them real. It's his script and his cast that helps keep everything up there. It's a true addictive skill in Majkowski and all that involves this movie, and draws it to draw and character, never once our nervous work. Majkowski took a movie that could be abrasive and repugnant, and somehow gave it a heart and mood. This is a unique film. Do not be missed. <br /> <br />
