Enjoy playing this movie on very late late TV and has kept my interest in out the whole picture. This wonderful creepy, yet mysterious looking English home, and decorating evil looking and furniture furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) Tales about this home, and each home resident meets all kinds of issues. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also the sweet song of birds, but do not let your fools, there are horrors all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", 80 gave a great performance as one of the household members and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of Crimson's altar," 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks, Reid) makes a wonderful wonderful story together, her daughter for some reason loves her WITCHCRAFT BOOK! If you like flu movie, terrible and mysterious, and lots of surprises, this is the movie for you !!!!
