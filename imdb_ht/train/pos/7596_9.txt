The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! Mystery is waiting to be solved with a lot of good drums! I love the fact that they gradually reveal their stories about the characters! Explain just enough to stay excited! Of course this shows some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters that for some reason do not show up in the third quarter! Many of the characters have a decent throwing off, but some of them just are not there! Like Rose with her husband! Where the Hell Are? What happened to them? Maybe they will return to episodes later! But it's a little inconsistent! That said "Lost" managed to be thrilling every episode (especially the first two seasons)! That's something very hard to do! I noticed that in the third quarter of the focus is more about character development than the mystery aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! He even saved some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can consider the strength of this show is the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I'll want to see some mysteries to be resolved and get close! The danger of "Lost" will be canceled due to declining ratings is close! And that would be devastating!
