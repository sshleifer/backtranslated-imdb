SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on WTC.2 French film makers in New York for action actions a NYFD action is being confronted with this event and making the most of it. Before 9/11 There is nothing really happens that gives the film an even more horror like scenario. On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day to work but this will soon change. As one movie maker goes on the road and the firefighters read the first movie crashed plane, this is the only footage of the first impact. It rides with the firefighters of the WTC and goes inside the building. As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident. In the next period of time we see firefighters plan to save as many people as possible, In Meanwhile we hear sound strokes, these are the sounds of people flying down from the tower and falling to the ground, this is the most gruesome moment of the documentary. And then tower In collapsing with our French friend was running for his life, you hear his breath as a fool while he runs out of the building. Then a huge sort of fading on it with the black screen turns it was likely to survive and now she can film the empty streets in Downtown New York. Because this documentary has received many historical footage and because the movie was to be a totally different documentary that will probably stay in the memory of everyone. I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoons, so this made it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
