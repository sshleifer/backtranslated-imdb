Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best adventure music. I loved this movie for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. Even though the scene "flying bed" scenes, the scenes and other magic and comic dialogue. Could they have chosen anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not think of anyone more suited to the role. This classic note should be as stupid as noticed by Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though he has some quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. It was a funny genius who often forgot about nowadays. Injury, premium and inappropriate English - nobody would really make slapstick and pull it as gracefully as it does. It would be tragically remarked this movie because Tomlinson died for a few years and nobody could step in his shoes and do justice to his character. Night to dance with weapons has a magic aura on which other movies and witches just do not take. I particularly enjoy the part of the Germans who invaded the Eglantine home and should defend it in any way they can. <br /> <br /> Bobbing together, bobbing along on the bottom of beautiful briny, the sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the music numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road was one of my favorites. <br /> A great movie that always keeps up today !!
