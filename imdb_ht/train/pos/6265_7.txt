Nick and Kelly are ready to be married to Travis (Kelly's dog) to bring Nick into a strange blue wall that will change the bee to Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick likes to drink, smoke, and play pools and flares for fun but Nick suddenly abstains from this kind of fun. Sex is one thing she likes because she wants a child. We find that a foreign race is dying and they need to interbreed with women from Earth to save their populations. It became a struggle for survival between humans and aliens and the dog population also being involved. A fine film.
