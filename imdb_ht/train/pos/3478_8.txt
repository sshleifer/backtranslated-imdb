This was actually my favorite set of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought every episode was more of a corner and the bandits had a lot of creative thinking put in them (and even very scary and credible as well). Some of the best episodes were "I Left My Neck In San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea", "The Ghoul, The Beat And The Ugly" and "When You Want On A Star Beast" . If you have never seen these episodes please do. This series was a bit of a mixed bag as there were other episodes that did not seem to have the same kind of corners as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and the "ransom of Scooby princes". As the series before it, it was very well put together, interesting and brilliant storyline scenarios. As everyone says though, it would be so much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tedious and distracted by the story being told.
