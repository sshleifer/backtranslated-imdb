The 3rd and in my view the best of the Blackadder series. The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character from the previous series, but Prince Henry Hugh Laurie's Rule is decently mad laughing a line as a pack it's kind the quality of and convincing kindergarten, superb cut sarcasm and small bits of the wacky, the actors' macbeth 'stand out with our chances Prince George' chicken, and the missing words in Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Some comedies have been as good as both smart as they are funny, okay the odd mute observation or lines come in hand especially to it in a cry.
