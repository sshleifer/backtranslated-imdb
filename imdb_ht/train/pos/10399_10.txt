This was a favorite of my childhood - I can remember seeing it on TV and thrilling at it every time. Now that I grow up and have a kid in my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic film. We watched it last Friday, and he loved it. During the Battle of Abu and the Giant Spider, but my son crept on it taking hold of me - he was really scared. "Will he beat the spider, Poppa?" Just look, you'll see. It does not have any historical frame of reference in (eight years old), so Baghdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma. <br /> I think he especially liked how much of the heroic and sin-being were perpetrated by the boy-robber, and not the adult-up king. In fact, if you deconstruct the film narrative somewhat, the king is sidekick the thief, not the hero of all - that must be very imaginative, young boy adventures. <br /> It's definitely a piece of period - I suspect that by the time it's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using. Love story is barely one dimension - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the narrative asked him." The desire of Abu to put himself in danger (repeat) to the clueless, the love-hitting casting of the king is also incredible. However, they had to load on these things while accepting mechanical flying horses, fifty foot-engineering and temples of all-seeing eyes would be fatigue in the extreme. Satisfaction in seeing the prophecy fulfilled at The bigger film movie is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu Triumphant fly away on rug (stolen) magic, seeking "some fun, and the latest adventure!"
