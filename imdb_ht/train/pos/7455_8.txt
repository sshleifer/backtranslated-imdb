Goldeneye will always come down as one of your most legendary games in VG history. They have no doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern bond Bond, in its time. <br /> <br /> This was not a bond based game based on other means. This was a completely new one; scripted game. Which even had its own theme song! (would not be unknowing, haha!) Gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond or film games alike, you'll enjoy it. Throw members to show the characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creation for the game. Give it that feeling more cinemas. With a simple 'god' that can, you feel like you in the game as much as you get lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy in every aspect, from the start to finish. Even after beating the game there's still much more to do. With the ranking and unlockables system to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-up game. Despite being quite old now, in video game years. It's always a good game that you can pick up & play every time you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just think about it, I've had that song singing stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well-written storyline. The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and it is every bit as fun as the game itself. Superbly done, in good fashion. Which can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> I had to go this game over now. If you have not played it yet, you're missing out!
