This was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a movie theater $ 2 along Hollywood Blvd. , So I did not have any references to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked in the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he would not let it slip, it came out to do something about it. Courage? I thought that - at a point where she sent out my spine. <br /> I think this film is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that only serves its own interests. I was very blown on it, and this thought is still one of the best films of the hero / anti-hero genre, which one might laugh but includes contemporary movies like the "Punisher", but even more so because it is a true story. The last note begins the "Rock" just does not make any sense of the real fire in the story of Buford Pusser. A "classic" that I'm sure you're resurface again in the future.
