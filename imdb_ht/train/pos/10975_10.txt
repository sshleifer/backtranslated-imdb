The daughters' daughters are poetry: "I can not go to another year. I got to get to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf to a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble deck is moving in ... it just gave you a washing machine. That's the deal." "I'm pulverized by this last thing." "Carbon and cats become a bit boring for too much time." "The little rat's nest, my mouse hole would love better." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... and the pleasure is all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, straightforward like an ink." "Always do everything correctly." "Where is the Hell You Out?" "... bring me my radio I had some professional music." "I'm your mother, remember me?" The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent movie. This is Mother's Day Movie.
