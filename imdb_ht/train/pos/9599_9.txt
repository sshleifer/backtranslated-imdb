I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house. It's incredible to see not only that a great Darius man, but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at a young age. <br /> It also made me think how lousy MTV was, and how they gave an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way, they refused. Show you if they really care about their teens and viewers at all. <br /> It's a wonderful and heartbreaking true story ... take your tissue but it's great to see how caring and inspiring young of today can be.
