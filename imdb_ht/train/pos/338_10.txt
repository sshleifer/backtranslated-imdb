I saw this film at the Amsterdam Film Festival in Amsterdam, and it was likely to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are New Yorkers living with great mines. The film title in Amsterdam kept the river about your right, making the sensational aspect of the cannibal a bit less important. Similarly liking was liking - and gay-related Tobias Schneebaum had and members of the groups he had studied as an anthropologist. Reunion's in almost 80 years of age and inevitable left-taking were very moved. I can only highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is nothing but pedestrians.
