9 / 10- 30 minutes of fear of terror day. Well, so it's not that scary. But it sure is fun. <br /> <br /> The Cryptic Capture (John Kassir) against a story of FEAR holiday, giving you all Christmas Goose ... GosseBUMPS That is. Bwahahahahha. You should really be careful what your AX Santa is. Have a Happy Christmas and a Happy New Heart. Well I'll stop. Okay, so in the story, a vicious wife (World's Best Screamer, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets towel pour into death of ANOES 2) for the money. But his plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a Santa suit (Larry "Dr Giggles" Drake) comes his way. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you've already seen this (see my third). But if you have not seen it, I suggest you do.
