While it certainly was not the best movie I ever saw, it was certainly worth the $ 8 (which can not be said for many films these days.) <br /> This was a beautiful account in a real story, Although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the film, (ie, Billy's character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) Robert DeNiro was of good taste, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , was also impressive.
