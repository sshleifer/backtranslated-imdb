If you have not seen this, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do, you'll be litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing out from this hard street, and has probably wet yourself as well. <br /> It's funny. There was no one funny performance on this date that I saw that this head or even came off. So many classics of a cover, story, and segment .. <br /> The uncle drunken in the BBQ, Joe Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, man cream, you say any of these to anyone which saw this performance and I'll bet you dollar donuts will not be able to hold a straight face and will burst out of laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue out of the act. <br /> <br /> Most classic !! Shame you can not find it on DVD .. <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
