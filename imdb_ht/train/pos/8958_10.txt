After you see Vertigo, then watch Bell, Book and Candle, made in one month. <br /> <br /> My second favorite Kim Novak movie, and picnic, come in as third .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . They came to my place where Kansas Prairie town, near by, in Salina, Kansas in the 50s, in film, picnic. <br /> Bell, Book and Ball Bullet Bullet, I believe is one of the Alex North. Perfect for bit of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, made this comedy, how fun to remember the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> Worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. Garba's Greta in my teens.
