* WARNING * Spoilers before ... The writers in this story knew these guys very well. The actors, as well, describe them very well. The result is that by the end of the movie you feel like you're actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The tensions are expected, especially in the first few moments.

The pain is still there, and interrupted at times but not John's time gets the idea to take Lorne Michaels up on his bid to pay the Beatles the gam sum of the $ 3000 to appear on "Saturday Night Live", the two would be even juvenile pranksters who terrorized Liverpool together as adolescents, and survived playing the rough boxes in Hamburg boarding at Superstardom.
