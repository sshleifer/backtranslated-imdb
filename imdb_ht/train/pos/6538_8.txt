I really enjoyed this movie. It's the place to do something that some movies do now; It gives family values ​​while amusing me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up. The girls I've been and all enjoy the movie and keep talking about Nancy as we walked out of the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents will get bored sitting in the theater. No, he will not have an Oscar and he did not show magnificent special effects or even given a mysterious spooky mystery, but he entertained me and he stood true to the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody and a young girl (she'll love it!) Or any fan of the books. You will not be disappointed.
