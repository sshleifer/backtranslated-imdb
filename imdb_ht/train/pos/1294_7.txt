Unremittingly weak and depressing, the movie recalls as well as the desperation of legends and voices contrary to Houellebecq's romance of the same name. Like many French films, its way is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow - or should that, slowly painful? While this is an excellent film and challenge, it is not one enjoyable and difficult to think at any time when someone can be in the 'right' attitude to seeing it.
