Homicide: The film proved to be a good wrap-up in a series of well-written, well-directed and well-acting assets. They bind the tie that had not been adequately addressed at the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the movie, provides a life-like look of life (and death) in Baltimore, a unique culture town with a very high crime rate. My attraction in the series started long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly keeps that spirit. I will certainly miss the new original episodes of the series, but I'm very grateful to the NBC and the producers and throw to give us a last glimpse in the dark side of Cham City.
