The movie is a fantasy. The story line is thin but it serves as the structure on which some wonderful songs are sung and sings very well. (I still can not believe that these lovely and attractive people could sing this well.) Some of the dialogue is wonderful. The costumes make me feel as though I was watching a fashion show Haute Couture from 1942. <br /> <br /> The movies are designed to serve many reasons. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. If I have one negative comment it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the beautiful superbly counting. Some of the tight have made me comfortable. But he could still sing with breathtaking songs. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. This genre is well before me, and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy films and related conversations. The music of this movie is beautiful. As much as I love the classic rock music that is full of modern movies, there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more delightful, better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in today's movie cinema. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not sure why many other posters are apologetic about liking this film and more generally this group of movies. They say it is dating and tries to explain why it is as it is. And who does not like it say it's not very good, but compared to that? I think this film will surely be fun when many other films have long been forgotten. There is just too much quality in every way in this movie so it should not be remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation for anyone who appreciates great talent, beautiful beauty and great music.
