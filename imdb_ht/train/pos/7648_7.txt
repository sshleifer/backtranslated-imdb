I admit I have a weakness for history history, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY 12:01. Among these people is thanks to this little. It is very difficult to get into MR. DESTINY without giving a shake of appreciation to each and every cast member, from the well-known James Belushi to the Mortgage Cox locks. This film lacks the gravitas and scale of making it a big movie, but it's a fine cheer-on a rainy afternoon. It's also a great location for an expensive date.
