Talking about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors ever seen anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Miliono Hot," a comic, original comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-resident embezzler who has the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a company run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It does not navigate lists; He attracted the attention of his company's competitor, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knew him in place of residence under another name), became his secretary for a short period. He can not hold a job and has seen all the film in a variety of jobs - all finished with being shot. When Newhart made her progress, she invited Ustinov to flat her for curry as a cover-up, but the two decided to be doing for each other. Of course, he does not know that Ustinov is a thief. <br /> <br /> This is like a good movie - you can not help but love Ustinov and Smith and be captured by Ustinov's machinery, his genius, and his way glithers out of trouble. But there is a finite twist that will show you who really have the brains. Do not miss this movie, put in '60s London. It's worth if it's only heard Maggie Smith punishing, "I was racked."
