Before we start, I have a pair of dentists. This movie gives me the ramps and even makes me cringe. That's what I love about this movie. The movie is kind of boring. For this, I take 3 stars in! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on her. Soon, he begins to have delusions and begins to torture his patients, kill co-workers, and even tortured his wife to death and kill the man he had an affair with .. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and gory. I would recommend it if you are in gore. <br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Doctor Alan Feinstein is not your Dental Practice Daily!
