Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold night, and then going to bed. There is no need to close the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling in the trees. Shortly after midnight a car and light cut inches up the driveway. Sometimes later an intruder pierces a flashlight in the living room of your nuts. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so is the environment: a remote farmhouse ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's best selling book, with B & W lighting comparable to 1940's best films, "Cold Blood" presents a dire story, especially in the First Act, as the plot takes place widely night and rain rain country roads. It's bad nightmare. But that's no dream. The events really happened, in 1959. Two men and heads full of sorcery killed a whole Kansas family, looking for a catcher in cash that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks uses current places where real-life events have arrived, even the Farmhouse ... and its interior! It's done for a memorable, and haunted movie. <br /> <br /> Both of the actors lead closely to the two real-life lives. Robert Blake is more than convinced as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bom tree, who dreamed of finding Cortez 'buried his treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the artist with the list-talking with an all-American smile. <br /> <br /> After starting Spree, head duo in Mexico. Things go awry, so they go back to the U.S., steal cars, hitchhiking, and generally were miserable as they roam from where they are placed. But it's a fool's life, and the two bans will soon regret their actions. The final minute film is mesmerizing, as rainfall, the rope is reinforced, and all we hear is pounding in a beat heart. <br /> Even with its slightly mid-law laws, "Cold Blood" steps into detailing a real-life storyline that still hypnotizes, almost half a century later. It's that environment that makes it. Do you think people in Kansas still left their doors locked ... at night?
