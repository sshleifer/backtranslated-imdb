Stargate SG-1 is a cutting turn of type from the 1994 film "Stargate." I am glad they decided to expand on the subject. The show came rolling out of the very first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill went to the gate once more to meet with his old boyfriend, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very clever man who allows no one to walk on it, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, valiant companion who challenged his false God, and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The worst guys called the Gouald, they are parasites that can find elements of one's brain, thus controlling them and doing bad. Any Gouald with a massive amount of power is often considered a "Lord System." The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who houses the parasite in their bodies until the gouver can find elements of a human brain. <br /> In the episodes, we mostly get to see SG-1, team exploration including Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, going to the wormhole that immediately transported to other planets (this called call The Stargate) and meet new cultures or bad guys. There are some episodes on earth, meaning they do not go to the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with problems pressing on Earth. In the years, you begin to see a decline in the SG-1 team as close embroidery, and more line-building lines. This, in turn means even more over-world episodes, which is perfectly understood. <br /> Rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, there are some circumstances in story lines not getting wrapped up and less at an emphasis on these recent travel gates some. But still, science fiction!
