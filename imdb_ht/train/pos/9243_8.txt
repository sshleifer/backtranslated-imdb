Do not listen to the many comments and desizory that have been hosted on this movie ..... simply put, regardless of Ninja movies, this my friend is about as good as it gets! <br /> <br /> Yes it's funny, yes the act and the script admitted absolutely atrocious, but not gum - it's so much fun! In fact, as is often the case with B Movies, the horrendous 'act' (which in the case of the movie in question is really among the worst I've ever had to be happy to watch!) And ridiculous 'draw' actually only serve elevated levels of fun ten pleasures. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the battle scene is the main attraction of this though and for the most part I'm happy to say, they're very well choreographed, especially final confrontation (while we witness that ninja is not officially constrained by the normal laws of gravity ...) <br /> <br /> Trust me on this, if you are a fan of Ninja movies and you have not yet seen Sakura Killer, then you are really miss out on what's my opinion, one of the true jewels of the crown of the genre.
