let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching over me i paid close attention to his acting <br /> when he raised his voice, i can not help but think of happy gilmore shouting strong in a golf ball, then I snap back like Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> scene <br /> Don Cheadle still does a great job and it's no exception here and really great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in any movie she has <br /> <br /> Sandam Adam was the amazing So many ways not only was this the most dramatic he / she best film acting in her career. but I can remember laughing loudly in many parts of this movie <br /> <br /> The cast in support was great too with Safran Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to be tremendous acting beautiful shots in NYC great great drama comedy With a new respect found for Adam Sandler if you ever doubt it or an assurance of how big Don Cheadle is
