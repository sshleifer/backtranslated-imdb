I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I read and looked very classic before, and I believe that most classics were boring, over-words, and voice stories and modern interesting cemetery at best. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my concept. Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress, and provides a beautiful portrait of Jane Eyre. Its attractive is delightful and quiet nature, but it matches the character's character exactly. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the movie made me believe he was born to play the brooding master at Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after watching this miniseries. The plot is both haunting and inspiring. The mastery characters do, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever to appear on film. <br /> I read the book later and was surprised at how well this ministries followed Charolette Bronte writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a ruler who will change your life, see 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
