The Price of Beauty made on the edge of the change from sound to silence, which became a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silence, she was released with an armed band in France, with a French actress Louise Brooks, but was released as a silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see Cineteca tell Boloya's unprecedented restoration of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that silent version is much more satisfying, since not all reporting the wrong duplicate does (Louise Brooks is clearly speaking English, so there's no His style can be matched.) Also, the film is made entirely in silent style, with some small titles needed for dialogue. The Price of Beauty tells her story visually, with exciting, imaginative camera-work. The opening is instantly kinetic, and rapidly-cut scenes of urban life and swinging projection to a public beach. Throughout the film there is a visual emphasis on clothes, cars, decorations, and symbolic images as a cage bird, a pile of torn pictures, a diamond bracelet. This is silent film technique at its pinnacle. Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the movie from obscures. Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last start roles. Lustrously beautiful, it dominates the movie with its charisma and also provides a perfectly natural yet highly-performing performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for her better known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a tipist and a posh fiancee, who is eager to get more out of life and secretly enters into a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her new celebrity life and her love for the man who insists she gives it all up or loses her. All the characters are drawn with nuances. The fiance inspires mercy and is not merely a brutal: it likes Lucienne, but it's a limited man who can not cope with it that has a separate life of it or attracts the attentions of others. Even "others" in the story is not our simple slimeball first to take it for, though its intent can be just as poshive as the fianc√©. *************** AVAILABLE: COMPLETE SPOILERS ***************** <br /> <br /> The film has lots of fine Pieces, including Lucienne's triumphs in the "Miss Europe" competition, are shown in the comical reactions of matching audience members, which wind up melting the heroine and flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes during the pendulum in the cocoa clock marks time behind her; a nightmare trip into a fun-fair (in silent version, this comes late in the movie, after her wedding) in which Lucienne, broke down among the low lives and depressed by her husband's antique macho, decided to it can not go on with the presence it is present; and especially the final stage in the projection room where he sees his talkie screen test. Louise Brooks can never look more beautiful than she does here, with the beam projector flickering on her profile, her shoulders swathed in white fur, her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches her singing on screen. The double shot of her body exquisite and still-living images on the screen is particularly imminent: Louise Brooks' images, such as Lucienne, remain immortal despite the frustrated movie career she has announced.
