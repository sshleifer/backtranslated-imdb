This first part of Trilogy of BRD has more passion and density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political movements have points in them: we see the shortages of the war, how blackmarketers could control much of the day-to-day lives (tasty moments when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, trying to sell a complete Kleist series in Schygulla, who noticed that burning books does not give much heat: it really wants to stick.) There are some unfortunately in the first hour. The scene of Maria's bedroom and the black soldier, cut by Hermann's appearance should go faster. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald fell flat when he insulted the GI - I cringed, it was so bad. But as the story develops and the years go by, I have drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world.
