The Sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clense suspension / mystery but it got up with some good acting rhythm and rhythm. These stories were already for the most part attended as many permutations as we can carry, so what we are leaving with is how good is the act, how smart they are to setup and bad guys, how well manufactured is the main scheme etc. etc. ..... So the Sentinel does a solid job to give it to content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both hold some good screen bravado and attitude. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw him on the screen) brings some satisfying support. Any artifacts in the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit, but it deserves to slack. Worth a look if you like the genre.
