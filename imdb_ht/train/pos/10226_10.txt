I was around 7 when I saw this movie first. It was not so special then, but a few years later I saw him again and this time he made fun, a lot :) <br /> I think the best part of film Of them are: Yeti's body language and 'special effects' too. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a blockbuster Hollywood made, even this movie has been made from approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> I was a copy of it.Movie and video versions as well (but I do not think it has ever been shown in movies) <br /> it, enjoy it press yeti forever !!!
