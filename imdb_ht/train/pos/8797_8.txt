A great idea: 11 stories on September 11. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach speaks of an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). The French also did a good job, while the movie in Burkina Faso was a wonderful surprise. However, the movie of Israel was a bit boring, with the Mexican guy, well, it should be left directly and worked in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
