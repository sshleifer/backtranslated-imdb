If you enjoy romantic comedy then you will find the story of two 30 year old singles that fell in love during the American Champions League champion meeting. On the other hand, if you're hanging around waiting for Volume Volume Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away. The draw has the compulsive guy to meet the girl's friend, girl meet the guy's friend, and guy meets the girl's parents scene. There's even a guy meets the dog's dog scene scene. That's all right for the course of a movie like this. However, what I liked about was that the plot delved into the decision to make the process of doing as they began to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact somewhat original. Draw the center around to answer the questions; how much competition is too much and how much does it take to trump those are rare? It is interesting to see the characters work out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have whims. Barrymore does a great job in his role and Fallon sorta surprised me - it's good as well. I missed it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you're a fan of Yanki.
