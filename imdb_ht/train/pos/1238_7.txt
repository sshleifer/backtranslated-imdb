While this movie has many flaws, it is in fact a fun '80s movie. Eddie Murphy himself during his 80s movies here. While her character is indistinguable from earlier movies, her distribution is almost impeccable with perfect partner and blur. This couple and the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, this makes for a fun day action-comedy movie raid. <br /> <br />
