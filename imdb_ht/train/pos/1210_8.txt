And my kids love it now! Granted, I can watch it now and realize the animation was not that great, and that the plot is trite. Hey, if every villian presents himself when he says "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they might laugh at, but for toddlers it is a moral story and catchy music. <br /> <br /> Music is so catchy, yourself, that I still had words to memorize after they did not see this movie in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this one for younger children.
