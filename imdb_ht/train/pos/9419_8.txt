This rigid Guinness Guinness is a very good political satire satire in the corporate industry, with a unique unique study as well. <br /> The raze is a slow down for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor comics, except perhaps the sound effects of their experience. But it has its fun moments, and it is very nimble in its execution. Segment Blast is probably the most common element. The union procedures are quite rude, very reminiscent of me all right JACK; especially the feminine socialist and a romantic smash on Guinness characters. Political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as a heavy one. <br /> I do not think that this one works well as well as the LADYKILLERS, or HEARTS HEARTS and COWONETS; but even comedy Ealing Light is better than anything.
