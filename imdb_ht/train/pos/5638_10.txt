I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for adolescents and should be more appreciated. This film is about these dreams and never gives up no matter what people can do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams just like Britney. <br /> There are times in everyday life when people are judged for what they are not. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. It will never know how much this means for me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
