Born again is an epic episode of Season 1. The bit of reincarnation, in my opinion, is cool. The more I watch it, the more I like it, but it will never rise above 'very good' for me. Even if it's not very memorable, I'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I'm going to say good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami. Oh Yeah! <br /> This tank was beautiful fish. =] <br /> <br /> Throw out a window. Very stylish. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: marry your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> What a random selection is reincarnated. <br /> <br /> Why was not the guy who died without his scarf tangled up, trying to take his scarf off instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10
