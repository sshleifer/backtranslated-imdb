Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart, and David Lewis in the movie. Throw the movie all acting really well. Robert Wagner has played his role well. The relationship between Saboto Jr and Turner was a nice one. There may be a great age difference but they are a unique couple. The two actors really worked together quite well. The music of the movie is really good by Ron Ramin and fits the flick perfectly. There are a lot of things that are happening in the movie that you do not know what is going on and what will happen next and this movie keeps you going from the beginning to end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner then watch this excellent movie!
