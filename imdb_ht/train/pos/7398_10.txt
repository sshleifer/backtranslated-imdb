Xizao is a very rare movie. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time thus rewarding in emotions and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashes is beautifully presented in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would fall flat if it was not for the magnificent characters and the actors who showed up. The Patriarch aging, Liu Master, is a kind of China's pre-expansion day. He runs a bathing house in an old neighborhood. Each single stage set in the bathtub is a source of joy to insist, happy people. Not even cynically hardened can find any flaw in this wonderful setting. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally disabled son Er Ming is the second most powerful character in the movie, coupled with his modern-life brother. The interaction between these three people, with the various visitors in the bathing house, are amazingly detailed and heart-felt, and some scenes packing many emotions in beyond almost everything seen in movies. <br /> With its diet-Criticism message, this movie has not only sung, but also gives unreliable protection. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to get, even on the internet (!), You can not help getting suspicious. So help free speech and movie in the world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there is even one, then sharing shared sharing!
