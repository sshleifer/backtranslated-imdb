The Korean War has dubbed America's warring war. So many unanswered questions are buried along with 50 thousand people who died. Occasionally, we are treated in a play or movie that deals with that far-off, gracious ghost graveyard. Here is perhaps one of the finest. It is called "Sergeant Ryker." The story is in an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who is chosen for a secret mission by his commanding officer. His job is to damage North Korean nations and to provide services to United Nations forces. So success is his cover, he proves invaluable in the enemy and gives the rank of Major. However, it is then captured by the Americans, set as trial as an insider and spy. He stated that he had ordered faults, unfortunately he learned that his commander officer had died and he had no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. However, her conviction is doubtful to Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing Commander Amos Baily, (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is awarded a new trial and found guilty of being executed. The court drama is top notch as the cast is including Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sisters. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant place, but the possibility of driving a Communist and hanging him was very close to home in the 1950s. Due to its superior script and powerful message, this drama has become a classic courtroom. Excellent look and recommend at all. ****
