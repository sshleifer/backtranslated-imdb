I really like to show this, she likes to read a book with each chapter you want more. It gets you thinking about what will happen to the next episode, and the struggle in trying to keep their friendship throughout the years. After each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitterness in your mouth knowing that: A - The show was good, you can not wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what's actually happening to friends of all twenty years. And two - the fact that the show was put "on Gone" and we will not see the finish show in it whole. Fox obviously does not know what they did, claiming they are losing viewers in the category 18 - 49 are clearly not aware what people want to see if they've got rid of a good show like "Reunion". I have only one research though I would like to increase. If they brought the show back and it went on for another season how it would work since every episode made within the period of one year and the story is based on what's happening in the twenty year span? Your answers are most welcome. Bring back meeting! Bring back meeting!
