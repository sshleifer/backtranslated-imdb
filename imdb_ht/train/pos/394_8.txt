This is an incredible comeback from mastermind film director, Tsui Hark. It is one of a few movies that deserve to come face to face with Shaolin Steven Chow's football match. From the moment the movie started, there was an astronomer in every corner that was <br /> unfolded with superb style. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts "geek", you'll love the excesses of many 3D effects and realistic computer product weapons. There, comes a fine performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung who plays "Sky King". He teamed up with Louis Koo (Red) who I was very impressed by his flexible "wings" that disturbed incoming attacks. Movement fights of these actors were competent in every way. Not only is the superb action but there is a somewhat complex scenario. Many critics in this film complained of the lack of story / theme or just "pushed into random bits of debris" and even described as "Poo Legends". However, the viewer can not count on watching Dragon Ballz and other Manga cartoons similar to understanding this movie. Others who are chemists and "Wu Xia" movies will have a much better approach. In due respect. There may be only one weakness that could be expected. The blow that was delivered to the enemy at the battlefield scene could have been much more and devastiingly done. In spite of all this, it must be seen.
