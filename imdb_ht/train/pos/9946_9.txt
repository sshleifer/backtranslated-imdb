Demand dream was an amazing movie. There were some apparent goofs, but this can be expected in a movie like this that was done in such a short time. I do not feel any incentive to move forward during the movie and I found it very fun. It gets unusual in liver, but in general I recommend it. They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were very good.
