The world is a terrible place. But this movie is mashed and fun it. But if you do not like it ... you do not get it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. It's up to you if you want to play together. Each actor in this one had fun. Only a joke. And that's right for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka make me way out, as "Vic" puts it, "... the best version ever". Okay ... it does not have any heads, but it's not bad. I warned against it, but I'm sure I did.
