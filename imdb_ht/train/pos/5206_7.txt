This evil movie bad: the samhain legend has plenty of thought or effort. It's ridiculous and features the ultra fast "slasher" style of death and plain disgusting act of death. The act has rated a D as the actor shows very small abilities, and the sort of in the movie is too skeptical. Ways have been shown to people of age to act as being incredibly different. The odd crack of pornography thought of it really does not offer much, and any respectable area but is quite quickly running down with absolute wrenching death affairs. Example is the fellow's poor who disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. It is probably evident in how little a child struggle is set up. This film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some terrible deaths and practically torture.
