I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africans in the 50's and 60's rather than as a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on top of another as small light point does not mean much until you have enough to paint a picture. The first time I saw Chocolat I did not really "get it" until she thought about it for a few days. Then I realized there was a lot of "get", including the colonial end of the corner, just no conspiracy. Anyway, it's one of my ever-present movies. The scene at the airport and the shower is short and beautiful music was the best poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not watch this - you'll be bored with tears. But for some of us ..., you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
