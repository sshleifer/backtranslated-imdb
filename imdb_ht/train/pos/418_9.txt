That's a riping western rip and I've watched it many times and it's fun on every level. Whether you're after the real facts about legend like Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane then look elsewhere, as John Ford suggests this is the west when truth becomes the legendary printing legend.The story is moving with a fishing rhythm, and there are some great dialogues between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur of the very watchful stars that help make this movie. The sharp step Amongst you might just spot Gabby Hayes as an American Scout, also has a very young Anthony Quinn performing his first as Cayenne warrior, he actually marries one of Daughters's daughters in real life.Edeed his Quinns character who informed Cooper's The massacre of Custer said in flash back, the final is well done and when the credit rolls it fuse the U.S. American and US history.So please take time out to watch this classic western.
