I heard people say this film is dull mat. I do not think they were watching the right movie. This is not the movie of prototype action, Thanksgiving. <br /> This is a psychological drama on the rookie and advises him that just happens to kill. In this way it works very well, with terrific performances from Berenger and Zane (non-sleepwalk in the movie as it has other roles - it actually seems to act). <br /> I was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it did not make much sense and was satisfactory to provide the construction from the rest of the movie. But watch Zane's face as he panic, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
