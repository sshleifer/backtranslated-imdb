Although the film is clearly dated, audiences can always be easily identified with the combat of buster hapless in this timeless and very funny omruder story. Buster battles against incredible odds of three different ages: The Stone Age, the Roman Age, and the Modern Age, play almost the same character and just a change in landscape helps us identify different "ages". In this film, we see one of the earliest comedy dreams of the stereotype "caveman", who has love for her not by romance, but by brutal force, as well as a funny twist on Roman conflict combat, two cartoon designs has long predicted such parody as Mel Brooks' "World History: Part I". The hidden theme of the film is simple yet convincing: Although the times may have a change, we still face even the same struggles in modern times that we fight in prehistoric times in order to "win the girl" ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It's interesting to look at this movie about eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie to "modern times" right now.
