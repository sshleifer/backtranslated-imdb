One of my favorite movies to date begins as an adventure in the wild side of a team of four guys from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living Chulawasse by the river before it's turned into a lake out of Lewis Burt Reynold, who unknowingly drives her hunger into worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears rather like a movie action, the second half brings the viewer into a totally different story, and our men are forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, each person will be forced to deal with the marks of what was just to be a weekend-on-the-river but muted in a fight for survival. The film (except some very obvious goofs) is very well-directed and beautiful in a paradise of nature that steals your breath. The photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tie to the same mistake.
