I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise to give reputation to the bad it seems to have been acquired. From a better perspective, the '16mm shrine' is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling. In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical drama of the episode, tackling the term of existence and reality, also balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride, and desires. The 'sixteen-millet chapel' is an episode of how these ideas are based on an unwillingness accepting change may seemingly alienate someone from the rest of the world to change forever. It is also a fantastic example of Twilight Zebra Area; one that explores the idea rather than the world outside it. These elements come together very nicely to create an incredible and incredibly exciting 25 minute thinking. The episode is not perfect however, which mostly lies in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt Lupino was convincing at all, and only a few scenes that might count as memorable. This of course was an absolute shame to consider how Sterling wrote his character. In addition Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having to stand on to make the next-nothing-probably explaining why to accept the poor performances from Lupino half-time in. Fortunately Balsam does a great job of covering many weaknesses, helping to make a show of a perspective at least .. As I have said, however, if you are a fan of classic film and cognitive science fiction, this should not be as bad as it sometimes made out to be. In addition to the writing that I mentioned above, the episode also features some fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks like this good almost fifty years later!) And decent enough to set-design. The overall sixteen-millimeter shrine "is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think.
