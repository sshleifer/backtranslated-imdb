The pilot is very well done. It explains how the bold characters of future episodes. I do not think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. It shows remarkable creativity on the part of the writers. Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happened in the future were demonstrated by the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachels in the future. Even if jumping into a first episode appears, it was overcome by an amazing plot with exceptional cast cast. <br /> <br /> A great start to an unbeatable comedy!
