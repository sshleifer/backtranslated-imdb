Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the riper of Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, especially women and children. It shows how the investigation was observed by the Soviet Union's bureaucrats, how difficult he was to investigate the crimes. He does the job in a brilliant way that he will leave no-one intact. In the beginning, it's perhaps a little slower at speed, but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, next to the "silence of the lambs", this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I have ever seen. <br /> It is very difficult to say that the performance of the actor stands out above the rest of this movie. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the forensic inexperienced expert who puts in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his supercooling superior, and the only person in the Russian government wants to help him, is as outstanding as the Rea. And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann, playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly creates a character that inspires sympathy rather than hatred. Yes, it's a monster, but it's also a sad face, ridiculous and ridiculous by his wife, boss, co-worker ... It's tortured, shameful, as well as very vicious. /> I can only recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a well-designed document, where actors are always more important than their special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
