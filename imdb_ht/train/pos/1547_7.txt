Like almost anyone else commented on this movie, I can only ask why this has never appeared on video. <br /> I remember seeing it at about 12 years on the "late show," about 1972. I also remember poisonous gas attacks with weirdly abundant horses. (I do not remember the horrific bits I've seen described here; they seemed to cut out for the TV audience.) But the scenes I really enjoyed were those involving the death of Lord Kitchener aboard HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scene of the unfinished cruise approaching the trap of the storm was really chilling, as I remember. <br /> <br /> Do not remember the music score, but the comments of others now have my curious. Get this one out of video!
