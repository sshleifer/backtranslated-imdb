Savaged when it came out, this movie now looks nice with great sound. A feast of cleverly clever tools, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, with a central performance moving from Jean Seberg to the beautiful and incredibly fast. Preminger does not skip around and shows off-slow down the time it takes you to listen to and reflect, with Graham Greene's Shaw condense without sacrificing complexity. The piece has a look at a movie for TV movie, and is certainly studio tied but not worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on 'historic' terms can not resist dumbing down. What would Mel Gibson do in the girl? Many drooling shots in it on the shelf probably, then crimping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does not. The burn shows mostly in a guilty response. Some weak performance, but not enough to cause serious damage. I kept this movie on TV and did not wait to look at it, but I was gripped. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected reminders.
