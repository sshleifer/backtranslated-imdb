If you saw this film, you were in Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and have addressed that we (PR) live a real mess now, the drugs were the main reasons for shooting and killings we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We do not feel safe yet, and in addition to, our so-called "justice" is not moved by truth and rights, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on reality, deplorable, and really portraying the Puerto Rican three main problems: the killings of the drugs, the money and the power of managing our courtrooms, and the innocent and the children were corrupted and even killed. Ricardo and his wife Poli, and their true-to-life sad and directional direction (**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare does not seem to end !!! ** They recently won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director of the Cinema World Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
