For those who commented on the Patriot as being accurate, (Which basically satanised the English), it was interesting to see this movie. Not all this was the bloody war that Americans had ever participated in, and were only the present nationality. That's why it was very refreshing to see something resembling historic accuracy from which side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as either martyrs or rescues. All in all, though that movie brought home are the true horrors of any conflict, and how all the acts committed in warfare only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a movie where you encouraged anybody on, but both both pity and loathed all.
