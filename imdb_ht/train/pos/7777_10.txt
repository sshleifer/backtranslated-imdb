Rich, Robert Robert Stack has fallen in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. She is married and so happy she stopped drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks best friend, Rock Hudson. With Stacks', Dorothy Malone, Lover after Rock. Throw in a few hassle with the movie going spinning out of control (in a great way). <br /> <br /> Very brilliant film of beautiful Technicolor with jaw-driven models and furniture (check Bacall's hotel room at the start). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, shapes-clothing. Basically this is a soap opera of class production value. The story itself is very fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously on the top. Acting by Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not that good, but seeing them for young and celebrity is great ... especially stack ... when he smiled knees I went weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deserved to have the best actress actress for her role. It's sexy, violent, greedy and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> Fun, sparkling garbage. Do not miss it!
