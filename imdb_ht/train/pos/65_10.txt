This film is not just about a school shooting, in fact it never saw. But that just adds to the power of this movie there. It's about people and how they deal with tragedy. I know he has been showing students who have survived Columbine and has given a sense of closure for many of them. The act is superb. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their role ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. One of these films that makes you talk about it after you see it. It sparked discussions about not only shooting schools but human emotions and reactions in all tragedy forms. It's a tear-jerker but it's well worth it and one I'll watch time and time again
