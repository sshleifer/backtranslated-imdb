I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is much more than just a documentary (provided by more than cold reality) and the mono / poop-time logos and lots of charts ... All "power" in this film from the impressive pictures were filmed- it's under water, in the air or the Arctic. With watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, it shows that we are integrating into circular flow life. This movie is not just for "environmental fans" although those who want to watch a good movie and a message should look at it. This film teaches me not only living on the ground ... we live with and in the ground and all plants and animals are growing and dying with us.
