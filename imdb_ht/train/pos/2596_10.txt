Adaptation of the movie by James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the ovaries voice, the direction, it all captures the feeling of the novel without sacrificing its own merits. Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the man cuckolded to marry and sailor Molly. I absolutely love this picture.
