I always wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I saw this film, I knew practically nothing about beatles. I do not even know all the names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, some albums that some people claim to be greatest all the time they broke up, John Marry Yoko Ono, and John were killed . <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, do not expect much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent. This is very important, because John and Paul speak very beautiful movie at all, everywhere they take out to explore more possibilities, and keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn provide good performance, in general. The finish was also very smart. I enjoyed how the film gets you excited about the SNL performance, and then bumps you over the top and make you realize that it would be best if they just let it go and finish it on a good score. My favorite moment is probably the third touch screen. <br /> In general, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It is a very good way to resolve your curiosity of what could happen if 6 years after Paul's break up just was shown on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason in viewing this movie, solving my curiosity over which the beatles really were and what could happen after the separation.
