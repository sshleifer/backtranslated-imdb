For a slash movie movie, this movie is actually better than a lot of the genre.yes it is predictable-black resident to work on killing islands, dead, yada yada yada.however have some good positives in this movie. First off, I really liked the black mask the work worn.it is definitely crap saying the least and maybe unique (although I did not watch each single slasher movie ever done), the genus of the bad due is something I have not seen before, and how it finally meets the end is a novel concept, as far as I know.I also really liked the weapon of work choice by Mr Disease, for most of the murderous killings even they are not as graphic as most of the genre, but this little concern.the movie does not take it seriously, which is something that most slashers suffer from at.oddly enough, while watching the movie, I was reminded of early "Friday the 13th films, which took themselves seriously.There is a few concerns about this movie.in several, the sudden assassin bears as Trong's resemblance to one of our horror icons. I then mean his movements and his reaction was fired, and also the way he walked. Bigger concern, however, is a very close stage, where Mr Crazy bears a more than resembling hit (actually a complete rip) to another famous band of titan.and in the very latest scenes, we have our scumbag Once again, looking exactly like the horror icon I mentioned. The fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon of the slasher genre. These scenes are weak and unoriginal (obviously) .by the way, the film is set in Australia, so if you are a sucker for a chick and an Aussie accent (like me) you will be in heaven. it just might grate on you.one other great things about this movie: cute Kylie Minogue (just do not get too attached to it) has an Aussie accent name, courtesy of Molly Ringwald.Overall, there is more reason to look than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so, I must give "cut" 8/10, which may seem too high in some people.
