Surprisingly good. The act was fun, the scenario was fun, the music was cheesy fun, the plot was stupendously fun. This was a fun movie to watch and give your brain some rest. Parts of the plot and quotes I found to be very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually for what he was, he would deserve a 10 out of 10. You should not compare this to an Arthouse movie or in a blood slasher movie.
