The first time I saw this film ago and they continued to see it several times a year when I had an opportunity. It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. Should anyone tell you it is crazy or outdated, ignoring them ... this movie is for anyone who loves laughing and music. The dance is not as important to this movie as in other Astaire movies for the comedy and acting shine. Watch this movie if you can, it can be light but it's still funny. So I know that many people hate black and white film, they think old movies can not really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without at least mildly amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire singing without dancing. It can be a great scene and singer can but it's just not fascinating with a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy gets a bit clich√© at times but the Vaudevillesque performances of G burn and G Allen are just perfect for the piece and can meet anyone looking for easy laughs. Give this movie a chance even if you do not like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridicule of any one.
