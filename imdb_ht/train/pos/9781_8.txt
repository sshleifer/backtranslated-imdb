I heard from TEARS in Kali shortly back and it sounded like something I should enter, but with all the films I came in on a regular basis, it was falling into my radar. While roaming around the local WonderBook ... I spotted the box for this one and grabbed it. I must say I am very happy I did. TEARS OF CALI is a strange, gory, sometimes outright movie climbing which is somewhat constrained by its budget obviously low - but it is still a fun and refreshing look. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> These techniques work either too well or not quite enough (depending on your opinion ...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also liberated about hapless victims. The movie said "Anthology-style", with a small but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequences, and then proceedings in three stories that made up the bulk of the movie. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist who visits one of the kil-members who are kept in a mental hospital. The journalist went on under the cover of the Taylor-Erikkson cult quilt, but we found that his true motto could hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that he may have come to himself ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who is convicted of psychological reactions in place of a prison sentences to beat a young man in a coma. We find that the doctor treated in question is actually a Taylor-Erikkson "ex-student", and its rehab methods far from the norm. The story closes (KALI) revolves around an "faith-healer" earthquake and his assistant 'making' miracle 'for a fee. When the heater involuntarily assisted one of his clients, he actually expelled a force that owned him, the devil is now free to roam and looking for a new army ... <br /> I have to say I really did Enjoy TEARS KALI. Some flaws and films that keep it from being really excellent - but it's an original and ambitious movie for what it is. My bigger major and output are poor dialogue and uninspired on-armed. The dual is sub-par and I would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. Some reviews say the act is poor, which I do not necessarily agree with. I think the duplication is so lacking-glittering that it performs their performance looks stubborn, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the highly damaging chilling performance ("the doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" of the third easy to come up with ...) and remarkable. The Gore FX is very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyeshadow-cut-scoop-scissors, a pencil-in-throat-suicide, some decent (but unjustly "unstable" head) -flaying , and another goodie's good cast for good measurements. Not as rough as some of the movie "Extreme" films are beyond, but definitely stronger than your average fare. I also found the story about the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change in the story of the story-story horror stories. There are many scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the love I have not come across quite a while. Although defective in some fundamental way, I still think TEARS in KALI will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes can prove too much for the mainstream viewer. Definitely Recommend - 8.5 / 10
