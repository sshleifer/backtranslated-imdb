This movie was like an explosion! He has that feeling-good, but totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie. She has a good message (party party decides she needs a real job) yet she does not completely lose all sense of pleasure. I recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor but also a thinker! :)
