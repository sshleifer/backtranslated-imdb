This episode in the Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acts and gags in sight, a tribute to the early Buster Keaton films. Many slapstick: Buster falls on a bra door, falls into a puddle, runs around pants-less. The Scientific Scientific Inventory of a Time Helmet, reminiscent of a Gordon Flash idea about what in the future would be. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for lady hats, or 17 cents a book for beef looks extremely high buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when it is mistakenly transported to the "modern" world in 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "Scientist" at that time wants to return to a calm world, the 1890 that he studied and admired. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy with the "scientist" regretted not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends it back to the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone does not have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, he is one of his last efforts. That's enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing - long enough to use Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairman who set the time frame - predicted his washing machine careers.
