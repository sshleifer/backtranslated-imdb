PETIT DOCTOR, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupying France, though their ability to compensate is not there. But it focuses on the weaker among the population. The image and cinematography are superb, and lend a feeling of feeling more in this complex story. It is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculus and murder. A certain movie should not be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos Mr. Serrault, for his painted paints.
