I love this show. Period. I have not looked very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it is now showing my favorite and probably will be for quite a while. I love all of the characters, except I'm not really worried about Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just did not find her funny, and I do not think that Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Other than her, I found the rest of the very good cast. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric parents, were very funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike a lot of fans, I did not completely hate the 8th season. I still look at her, and she makes me laugh. But if you compare it to the earlier season shows, it's not good. Randy is awful. The final was decent, nothing amazing but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but oh well. I have the fourth quarter on DVD, and one day I hope they have all eight episodes on DVD. Some of its most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'Dinner & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey', and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I've seen too far most of them I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
