I remember stumbling on this special while navigating-navigating in 1965. I never heard of Barbra before. When the show was over, I thought "This is probably the best thing about TV I'll ever see in my life." 42 years later, which was held true. There is still nothing so amazing, so honestly as the talent has appeared here. You can talk about all the stars you want, this is the most Supreme of them all! <br /> You name it, it can do it. Comedy, Pathos, Seduced Seduction, Ballads, Barbra is really a story-teller. His ability to pull into anything his attempt is legendary. But this special was done from the beginning, and it helped create the legend that it quickly came. In spite of rising so far in a while, he fulfilled the promise, revealing more of his talent as he went along. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in this view.
