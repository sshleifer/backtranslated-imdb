This is one movie-based movie-based movie that gets it right. On Friday the 13th, the series had no connection to the movies. The heritage of Poltergeists: I'm not so. It may have been linked to these films. It feels like they just throw a famous title on a show for their fans watching it. <br /> It shows Freddy being burned by parents Elm Street (in the 1st episode I believe) and the amount of parents was disappointing. With all of the children being targeted at the first 3 cinemas, you would expect more parents. But well. Freddy is basically the narrator for the show. He watched the actions of people in the real world sometimes becoming involved somehow. Just like other anthologies like Tales from the Crypt, there is a supernatural twist or surprise involved. <br /> <br /> The act is missing, but believe it or not: the occasion sometimes surpasses the movie. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was done around the time of the 4th film. I heard he was denied due to parents protesting. I watched a lot of stuff rated as a kid, so a shameful parent broke it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series, so it was not a total loss.
