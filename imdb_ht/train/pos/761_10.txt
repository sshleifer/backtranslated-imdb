I just mean that among all the so-called classic hiphop films I've seen as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc. ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best amongst others. Each time I ask others about who is their trades, then it seems that BEAT STREET pops out the most. But still, it is ranked lower at all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If, say, 5 points is the belt). I like the music performance, the breakdancing makes me want to turn, RAMO makes me want to send a piece ... c'mon, it's a classic !!!
