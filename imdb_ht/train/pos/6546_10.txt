I'm probably one of the biggest Nancy Drew fans out there. I've read every book three times and I've played a lot of games to draw Nancy. I like this movie. It keeps you entertained the entire time you watch it. I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved her. There were three women sitting behind us who appeared late in the late 40's and I asked them how they loved it, they said they loved it! So you see it will be an entertainment of all ages. You just have to give it a chance. And it teaches a lesson too, just for yourself though everyone around you is exactly alike. So, in general, this move was great. I'll see it a second time now! So stop bashing it please. It's a really good movie!
