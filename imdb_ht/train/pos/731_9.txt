This movie is SOOOO funny !!! The act is Wonderful, the Ramones are sexy, the subtle jokes, and the draw is just what every high school dreams to do in school. I absolutely love the band as well as the cynics carefully set. If you like python montana, you will love this movie. This film is a tad small "fat" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that sing the songs are likable; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is in. This music range the number two of my musicals (second next blues fees). But please do not think of it as a music for every saying; See how songs are so likable, it's hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene taking place. I think in this movie as more of a comedy and undertones in romance. You will remember what he liked to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will be reminiscing in your old high school day after seeing this movie. Very recommended for both the family (since it's a youthful but also adult since there are many funnier jokes and experiences.
