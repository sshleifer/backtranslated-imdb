I watch this movie twice now and think its well for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explained his theory about the migration of South American Indian pre-Colubian to the Polynesian islands in the way of rocks falling in the balsa tree. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and crew as they choose Balsa trees from Equidor and float and they come down the pacific river for the people of Peru. Launched on a 101 day sea adventure test strength of the primitive rocks survived only by means of native ones of that era. Look for yourself, a real adventure!
