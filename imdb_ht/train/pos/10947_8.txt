The Sarah Silverman program looks very similar to Sarah's own stand; It's over the head and prejudice that you can not possibly take it to heart. The fact is, though, that while most people are "finding it," it does not mean they'll all appreciate it. It's a very polarized and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can as well give up. If you do like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode so far was as good as the last. Like all shows, though, it's not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some big ones with it. Singing racists are funny, but they get bigger faster than Silverman looks like - a problem I've had with "Jesus is Magic" as well. It seems as if Silverman gave himself a quotation for singing for every episode that does not exist. Not to mention that while the lyrics of the songs he writes are good, the music, well, is not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will be for some reason the appeal of Monty Piton fans, Citizens Brigade Citizens, etc., it's nothing like that show. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as I like this show, I can not look beyond the half hour limit at a time. It gets pretty fast. The repeat value for this show is too low - a second time in an episode is fairly funny, and not the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. , very funny. Give it a shot.
