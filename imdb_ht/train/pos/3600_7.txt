At first I hope this movie should be annoying because I thought the plot would be so too feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in comments earlier published, I agree that the feminist part of this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. It's like Guzman presented as a person with a spine, in dealing with his peers. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was quite good, except for the predictable end. Maybe it would have been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist, so that the viewer is a bit more surprising. <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez was honored by his way of putting away his character. I can not really explain why, but especially in the scenes she likes to convince me. It just looks real I think. <br /> I gave it a 7 out of 10, simply because of half the last half hour.
