Enjoy this 1936 film with many classic actors and veterans, including William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role as a physician and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and got a divorce and still managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince her to be very important. Jean Arthur plays a kind of rather nutty and boasts in 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" has been given a strong support as a bookmaker alongside James Gleason, a detective who needs help from Dr. Bradford in order to solve the very unusual murder of this mystery. If you see this movie, just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the audience people in those days thought this was great entertainment, and it really was in those days!
