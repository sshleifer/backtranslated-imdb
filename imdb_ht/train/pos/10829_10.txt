I watched the movie in a preview and I really like it. Throw is excellent and the draw is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the film is definitely the music, which hopefully will be released soon. I recommend it to everyone who loves the British humor and especially to every musician. Go and see. It's great.
