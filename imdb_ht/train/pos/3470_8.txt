Even though I'm very young, The Beatles are ABS ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE! I never had the chances to hear the music as it was, but loved them since I can remember. It is the movie that is worth trying once. I can see why he was not released in the movie but it is certainly a great movie to put on the TV. I was flicking in my TV guide and came to see this film, it was not much detail except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney satisfied after The Beatles had broken up, Jared Harris Stars'. I'd never heard of it (played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However they certainly surprise the actors! <br /> <br /> The film had a slow start but as it developed, I could see how Quinn but especially Harris played the characters. As a great fan, I sort of know what real Lennon and McCartney they like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and style placement! Quinn played McCartney well but sometimes went into his Irish accent. These make-up artists make them look great. <br /> <br /> This paragraph can be counted as a * * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, it got to go to a slow start, but soon developed and it became well an emotional movie. I found a bit in the park a total waste of time and assets out of character for both of the musicians. As for Lennon's grin line in the Italian restaurant, it is totally unnecessary. The finish was very worried and brought a tear in my eyes every time I watched it .. It is quite different from the other biographical films I've seen where it's about how The Beatles got together and became popular, and those who never really did the characters well. E.g. 'Backbeat'. <br /> In conclusion, I would say, if you are a Beatles or John Lennon or fan McCartney fans, give it a chance to have fun pleasent. In just about 95 minutes long, it is worth waiting for the movie to develop. If anyone knows whether the meeting in 1976 really happened please send it to the 'comment page' for this movie, I'd be very interested.
