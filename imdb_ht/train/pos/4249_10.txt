Whether it's three guys in the tighty-whiteys rap it's a dude tied to wire or a girl saying "What's up, dog?" In a lump of roadkill, there's something to everyone's all at Knuckleface Jones. It is strange and surreal and not all together a completely comprehensible thread ... but it never loses you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed to myself. And every night after I came home and looked at her again. Forget coyote ugly ... this is the movie that cemented my crush on Piper Perabo. Watch it ... before it's too late!
