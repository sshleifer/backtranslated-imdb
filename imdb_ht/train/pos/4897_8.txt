This movie pulls you out of go-go because it tramples our attention does not recognize, yes, that this story will open with a clich√©? a funeral. <br /> From other than Judi I would not give it a 8 as this material was done over and over again: the great meeting at once famous, choose one please team, squad host, theater groups, musicians, bandwidths. But this movie never stoops good sentimentality, and when you think it will read swoops in another direction. A case of point is the flowers that are sent by a admirer of judi. The group members are an interesting and classy group as well. One prisoner, one found religion, one is an alki, with one flowing of dementia. But the Jewish living was discovered by Judi, who was banished by his daughter's interest, bringing us together and making us neglect the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> Throw is a person in that talent, Leslie Caron, Universal jazzist Cleo Laine and his amazing score, a recent performance of Joan Sims, Joan Brava, a beautiful as a flirtatious Ian Holm button has a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a living divorced money in the mountain of Scotland and its ghillie and his whiskey, the closed scene is Hollywoodland fare, children's judgment of the star converted into fun-loving supporters, lovers lovers old assembled, genes swept up in the old timers' music. Life should be this simple. But I would look it again, and intend to, with my own daughter. For the right hand, sometimes one just loves these bronze old bronzes. 8 out of 10.
