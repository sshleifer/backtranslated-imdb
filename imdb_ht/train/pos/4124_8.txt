Lloyd Bridge as Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars in this series. What made it so good to me when I watched it felt the real one to go underwater. The shows show a juvenile energy for exploration underwater that is infectious. <br /> <br /> The show has been education as well as showing things to viewer about scuba diving from someone who has appeared to be a pro fully, Mike Nelson. There was excellent show, and the program always appears to be quite productive. Granted, the drama of the scripts sometimes hits the same scores of more than 1 episode, but each show retains it in clean and any other show produced during this era, the infancy of the American television.
