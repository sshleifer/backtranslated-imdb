"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was everything preceded by it would be. It's not often you get that. Most of the time, the forecasts show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this one. I was pleased with the original plot, though the sub-plots did not. The animation did not break into such "shrek" but it was good, no less there. The plot and the story line was well presented and there was only a few slow spots in them. This keeps you interested. I find myself enjoying this one. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. Once you think about it a little, you can know what needs to happen but you really do not know for sure how it will happen. <br /> The casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, as Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. Commander Commander Rourke was well-chosen with James Garner. Her character reminds me of her performance at "Maverick" that I am loved. I really liked the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Its ability to play a nonsense personality makes the movie more interesting. It's just too bad it's a cruel one. <br /> <br /> Over all, definitely worth you while (8 out of 10).
