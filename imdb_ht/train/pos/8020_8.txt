I found this to be the most enjoyable movie Muppets, because I felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. The Muppets try to go on Broadway to sell an original music they've written, but along the way they run into the usual issues, including Kermit's memory here. While there are not so many great here as in the original "Muppets Movie," there are some including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply the time and delivery of lots of lines are great, and the muppets situations find themselves in their hilarious. The original songs are also good here, and the finish is satisfied. There is much more to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. It is Fuziest movie in Muppet and is sure to be enjoyed by all. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
