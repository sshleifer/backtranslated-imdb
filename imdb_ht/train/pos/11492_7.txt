Unborn tells the story of a married couple named Virginia (Brooke Adames) & Bradley Marshall (Jeff Hayenga) who tried for the last five years to become pregnant, Virginia had two Foscus since then & desperate to have a baby . To visit Dr. Richard Meyerling (James Karen) for help after being recommended by some of his friends, Dr. Meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. Dr. Meyerling operates on Virginia & it is soon confirmed that the operation was a success & Virginia was pregnant. The first thing to look perfect is that Marshall could not be happier, but the perfect life pictures do not last long as Virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she gets moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worry phone call from Beth (Jane Cameron), another woman who has undergone Dr Meyerling, who claims that Meyerling is in fact using her patients to end her own & is in fact a genetic researcher shamed. Virginia begins just what's growing inside of it ... <br /> <br /> Produced & directed by Rodman Flender I actually thought Unborn was a decent horror / thriller (it's DEFINITELY NOT A Sci- Women as IMDb would have you believe) that amazed me. The script by Henry Dominic is trying different and must take some credit for that at least. The Unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap tread & adverse effects, he has received quite a smart story that works & plays on basic human fears. It moves together at a pace even though it's not exactly a movie action by any means. The highest score was good & seemed a way to fitting round things off and the warnings about pity around and genetics seem even more important today than it had to be back then, maybe Flender knew something the rest of us did not. On the down side it misses some exploitation elements and is in the heart of a movie drive dialogue mainly focused on one person so he can get a bit dull at times. Also, I must mention it, what about Erath was that grin black skateboarding all over eh? Director Flender does an OK job, Unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting movie ever made but good enough. The atmosphere is good and there's a bit of strain as that Virginia has inside of it & Dr.'s Decisive Plan. Meyerling is not fully disclosed until the latest possible moment. Disappointingly the Blood & Gore is almost unexpected in such a way that the movie is down because of retrospect nothing really memorable happens, the Unborn is on good good stories, but within a week I doubt I'll miss too much about it. br> <br /> Technically the movie is OK, I would imagine that the Unborn had a very low budget but it's well done though it's a bit bland & forgettable. The baby's baby is actually a decent special effect and has fairly realistic facial movements. The act is good & this was one of the first acts to act credited to Friends (1994 - 2004) star Lisa Kudrow, I have to be honest I do not like Friends & I do not even know who he was in this so, I can not tell you how he did. <br /> <br /> Unborn is a good hunter / thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that shelves video store shelves. If you are a horror fan & looking for something a bit different, something a little more intelligent & thought provocative than normal then I think you could do a lot worse than the unborn. Followed by an unfinished descending dumbed II (1994) which I look right afterwards, check my review if you want.
