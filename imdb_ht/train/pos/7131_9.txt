This make-up-TV movie is a brilliant one. This is probably the best and most popular role of BAFTA with John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) widow lived in a small village for a while since his wife and son died, and now he landed with a evacue named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As it becomes known that this child begins to develop a friendship. Until Maman Willaim (Annabelle Apsion) wants her back. After Tom gets worried about William by contacting him and going to London to find him. At the end of Willaim gets home with a loving family (or dad). Set during the Second World War is an excellent film. He was nominated by the BAFTA Lew Grade Award, and won the National Award for TV for Famous Drama. John Thaw was the number 3 of the 50 largest TV star. Really good!
