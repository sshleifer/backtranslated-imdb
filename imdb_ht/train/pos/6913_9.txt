As a community theater actor who works hard at her, but does not act too badly, I'm still amused by people who treat her as Great Art. This film skewer "Craft Actor" in pity while dishing up a lot of good laughs. <br /> A cowboy actor aside for a movie brings a resignation to the dictator. When the dictator dies in a heart attack from excessive drinking and eating, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of a life" by the neo-Nazis head of the secret service. She plays it in Hilt, becoming the girlfriend's dictator falls in love with her, and vice versa, and turns the tables on her capture pretty well. Many large shtick do not lead them, many of their good jobs by some unknown anxiety concerns, particularly staff at home and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameo. Sammy Davis Jr makes light of himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman and another goes on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfuss are outstanding. dumb movie, but it has many nice places (in Brazil), a funny script, and good actors doing things and looking like they're actually having fun and not going to the usual existence of the Kingdom of what is just play-acting!
