Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley star in this movie is common? ??? The cast gives some good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin, a guy eternally diminished by harassing her), but the direction is very boring and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe that a movie like this has been producing for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): do you CRAZY ??? !!!
