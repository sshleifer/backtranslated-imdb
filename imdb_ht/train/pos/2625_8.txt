Surprisingly not horrible and quite animated for one of the Disney video streams cast far away. Like the previous one (The Lion King 2) I was pleased that Disney has brought back most of the original voice actors who make a big difference and maintain a good level of traditional animation. The plot travels around for a while, but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious dull. Breaking up the peripheral scheme and jokes gave us some funny music sequences, which much like jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part-time moments MST3K-like are swollen and full of untapped potential and really do not add a whole lot to the movie other than they act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. The new characters are at least favorable, and the old characters come out doing things so I can not be the fault there. Overall this film is not bad and it makes for a pretty serious filler between the most lethal Lion King titles.
