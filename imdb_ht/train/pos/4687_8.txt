Lizzie Borden loves crime is an important movie, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (including full nudity to female girls, ensuring that men beat men). It's sad and sadomasochism and the prisoner falls in love with capture theory. The treatment of feminine libido is sometimes deep and soaked, but Borden has traveled far beyond the dogmatic feminism of women to take power in the insatiable lusts. <br /> One striking scene exposed the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit mode photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing trunks by asking him to show how she rides a horse. She pushes a crate up between her legs, squeezing her against her side, and this greatly increases her excitement. Then suddenly he left home and swam abjectly to the door locked. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the con artists, and though it falls long in beautiful, she chooses on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe that women can swallow her line. Not all reports, Sean Young proves a weird person, and it's just pretty. But in this movie as the district attorney intense his face and long-limbed body with harsh and accentuated hip and occasionally movements of alchemy movements of erotic passion. Its performance is strength and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden owns an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern zeitgeist zeitgeist I really appreciate.
