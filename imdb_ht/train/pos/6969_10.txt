The first, this is an excellent set, though we have sort of a James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new roulette casino takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, Dr. Non (1962) being the second, while in Golden Eye, the first movie with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench refers to as new replacement for the "M" man so how could he succeed in the beginning before Bond became a double-0, aside from the fact that he is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" thrill license. We need to turn ourselves aside if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie is no of the primitive electronics of the original series from almost half a century ago. In the 1960s communication were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and have slip levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think 400 years from now, would it be perfect for Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let's give the producers some space. But try and do things a bit consistent, let's just meditate on the creation of Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If that is the case, where are all the Cylons that populate the original ground out? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumping in space. Well, what happened if one of the scyphic ships of war with the Caprica fleet was fired on or had a sunspot or whatever with one boat, packed with people-looking Cylons, wound up not only jumping into space but in time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a boat that infiltrates near Earth One. They colonized, found out they were able to repel it and eventually destroy themselves, but not before they themselves sent a "ragtag" fleet to search for the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, where they colonized to become people, which eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. Which came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It fraking fun!
