For all those who do not speak Swedish: Title [original] of this movie; "RÃ¥narna" translated into something in the line of "the thieves". This fact is the main problem I have with the movie, causing it not really about the thieves at all. It is about a young woman working to steal the Swedish police researching theft. A regular office work one would think, but this girl is soon out on the field to take matters into his own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the thieves ... Exactly: We saw this before. The fact that there is a rather interesting twist the half scheme does not really help as the finish is just like cliche as the first two thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's as exciting excitement as it is for the most part of the story. /> <br /> Something I really like about this movie is the fact that it's music sets the right attitude when it is necessary, but is absent for the rest of the time, giving a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and cars -Chases spread throughout the movie. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often tend to get typecasted Unfortunately the movie badly as you know he will not just play the companion of the heroine and be a character supported in the background, but this something you have negligence. <br /> All in all it's an entertaining movie that steals more money from plotting and spending time in your hands. 7/10
