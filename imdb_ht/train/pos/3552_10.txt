I just want to add two cents worth, and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel it's worth reminding people of the everlovin genius in Damon Runyon. Without the beautiful street, written by hilarious of Damon Runyon this movie would never have been made - neither most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & love before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and was from Colorado, but it was certain _get_ street scene on the east coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedy, I would recommend a few other flicks in the book by Damon Runyon; "Kid of Lemondrop," and "Little Miss Maker," both featuring Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, was still a funny man. (As a Western West Coast, I find her politics fairly funny, too!) Damon Runyon Life !!!!
