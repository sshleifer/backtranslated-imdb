Theo Robertson commented that WAW did not properly cover the WWI requirements that led to Hitler's Hit and WWII. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first one and a quarter Schedule of Volume 8? Covering this period, and together with the earlier traders of the series, clearly shows the existing requirements, I feel. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined Hitler the same Youth, and his experience was very similar to those mentioned in WAW. This documentary is so far above the History Channel's documentary I also own, that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The only fault, and it's a small one, that I have and WAW is this: numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about borrowing-lease, then how many war materials have been lent / leased? How much of Russia, how much for Britian? How many traders ship has shed the U-boat, and when? How many ships did German or Japanese sailors have, total, in 1941? What kind were they? How many troops? How many troops do allies, in total, and not countries? Many numbers could make a lot of viewers nod, but I would prefer MORE! And of course, I still want to see more military analysis. Like why by Patton & Clark the German army trapped in Cassini, after he was surrounded, instead of Monty's race in Rome, and left him escaping? I do not think you can begin to understand wars until you've seen some of the videos on the "total war," such as the Firebird Fire in Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips in the death camp: you just can not wrap yourself around it - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time, and of course, unfilmed, were the most blatant and inanimate Christians in the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "flyboys"), and some vivisection of prisoners medical "experimentation", w / o any anesthesia! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dave
