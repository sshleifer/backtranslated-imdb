One of the best music ever to do, this is an example where producers and directors did not fear to choose actors for their talents, rather than for what people might expect. The lighting and the sets are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I can not think of). The dialogue is also unique in that no shrinkage has been used. The film is well-trained, very well-known and exciting from start to finish. A real joy is the music. Such an array of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, are perfectly designed with orchestras. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think very much musically from the thirty in the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which might have only two or three. Not bad for a director who has no experience in this type of film. Another type is that it is cool every time one sees it.
