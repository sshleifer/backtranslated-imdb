I know that you have already entered this film festival (or at least I think you have, I can just do that up) but I think this should get "best animated film" in each. Bravo. I can not wait for the full movie. I realize that you can not hear that often enough because of the scarce nature of your animation, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Well, now, I'm just trying to find ten lines of text ... though I still mean it. And here comes another SHOE! - and I can not stop here again. This is very annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon." I have many people. <br /> <br /> -R
