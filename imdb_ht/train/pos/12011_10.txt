I'm spark in the negative comments that I have read and can only assume that the people who commented were less honest. This is the most moving and real painting of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen. It was a good act at the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Joseph's life into difficulty, good-natured optimism, persevering faith in man and God, and ultimately sacrificing this life in a way that frankly let me speak to silence in awe. If anyone, in any Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive ways - I should say it is a reflection of the person and the film. I give the movie a "10" and encourage honest honesty to see it. In many LESSONS a heart was felt by the portrait of the man who gave everything he had for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film stands as a reminder of the quality of our people They are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold. Ann Pruitt-
