Let's deal with it; Nancy Drew has never been great literature. It is in the same category as Babysitter Club, Magic Tree, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "beautiful", no internal conflict ever! and never change. Ned is pretty much the same. The movie was true in this style and I said, I love it. It will never be a big movie, but it has a taste even nostalgia that the books have kept. It was just the right amount of suspense for my child (8 and 10.) There were almost no offensive languages. I liked the push for more conservative clothing. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit of an annoyance. It was a little out of place on a high school campus. I never knew why he was in the first place.
