I liked watching "Sabrina, the young Witch" Friday night on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I've joined together every Friday just to watch this show and we never miss an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. It was adorable and sooo funny. I liked Harvey companion Sabrina, too. It was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart has played a good young witch, too. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Youth Years". These episodes were great. <br /> Overall I really miss this show. I expect an ABC day to bring it back to new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
