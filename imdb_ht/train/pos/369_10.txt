Absolutely one of my favorite movies ever. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can not go to it without crying. I challenge anyone to watch the reunion of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and Dad and do not feel your eyes getting misty. Whoopie Goldberg should have one awards for amazing painting. And for those who said you can not love the movie if you loved the book, wrong! I am a testament.
