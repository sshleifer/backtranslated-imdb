For those who say that this film deserved anything beneath the grace that it showed, I agree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us this movie rate. I ask you to consider the fact that the documentary did. The courage that he took to shoot this film is most remarkable. We find that the two brothers are divided when the time comes. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own security with each other. To judge whether it's sooner to shoot a video of this tragedy or save lives like these amazing, amazing firefighters did not answer me. I just know that in 30 years, a full class of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I submitted a 10th all this is why the art of filming was created! Take the natural emotion that real life offers. You can keep your kung-fu junk. Romance is beautiful. Action will never happen at this level. This film, 9/11, will be timeless in that he did not praise himself. He did not have a sneak-peek. He did not have all the blatant voices that shared a lion in the many films on the many blurred screens. It had classes, tight, substance, and had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. She talked about the inevitable things in the eye of the camera. Please consider this movie, as it itself proclaims, a paying tribute to all those who have fallen because of the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give anything less of a movie that shows, do not embellish, the natural courage of real people acting in real times. I love the "Godfather" but "9/11" is forever a different kind of movie like this is now another kind of world. It is artist without question or question. <br /> <br /> JF
