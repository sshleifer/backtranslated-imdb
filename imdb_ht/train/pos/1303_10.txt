Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-united to play their songs since 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream." Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys watched it: all the thin, very long hair, wild clothing and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good thing. Well, these guys are now 60-year old and can always sing and play at a high level as this beautiful concert concert shows us. I was always very familiar with Clapton, of course, that was never out of the limelight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, nor to those I have not seen in decades. They seized me. When he was young, Baker was so shiny he looked like a speed freak near death. Now it looks healthy, in form and playing drum it was solid. Bruce watched a bit haggard but his voice was great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear about these old songs. This is just excellent material and make out to guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticize this show to be low-key. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded pretty good. The second song, "Spoonful," was exceptional, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
