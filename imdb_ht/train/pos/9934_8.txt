"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for her frenetic editing style and "lousy" photography. His opponents cited its superficiality and criticized its deployment of "substance style" I could not agree more. I believe that "Domino" represents the sheer height of Tony Scott's movie-making career. <br /> After having created the dominant Hollywood movie acting films throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott moved progressively closer to a more subtle style of movies. As early as "Crimson Tide" Scott uses his stylistic talent to showcase the inner world of his character - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long linens combined with sidewalk angles . This was then brought to the "enemy of the State" and "spy game" that visually represents the worlds of monitoring and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "People on Fire" was an extreme departure, a movement of more aesthetic paintings. Here Scott uses a handheld antique cranked camera and flash frame to express his character's explosive rage. Although not entirely successful it presented the techniques that found the full expression of "Domino" <br /> <br /> <br /> Located in the framed device of an interrogation FBI "Domino" presented the life of the infamous bounty hunter through his relate to the disjointed fragments memory. It suffers from memory as we all do - in fragments, flashes and sticks. As Domino tells her story verbally reluctant to visualize not only the events described but also the guiding points. He has "track of mescaline" in his system, but his individual vision is anyway weird - that of a woman who fails the life of luxury for hunting bounty. <br /> It is when Domino begins to report the events leading to his captivity that Scott really lets RIP. Together with Cinematographer Dann Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrated a postmodern Canvas in contemporary Americana. Gradually we start to realize that strange though it may be that Domino is no more disjointed than the culture "90210" he was rejected. As it spread to this cultural mix Scott made his viewer more aware of the innocence that he destroyed in the underprivileged children that the narrative introduced. Ultimately Scott shows salvation as the only escape we have in this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this film of being overly stylized is the analogue of criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock to not represent what is humanly recognized. Like any big paint the meaning of "Domino" is to the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> I'm not in any way associated with Scott Free but still and will continue to be a great admirer to Tony Scott's work
