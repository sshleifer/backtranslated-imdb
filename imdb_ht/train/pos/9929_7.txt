I'm skeptical of this movie based on a true story. At the beginning it says based on a true story, sort of. I bet the only truth in having an old model bouncing bounty hunters maybe named Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyways, she starts with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Dominoes have been interpreting about what they know about a $ 10 million flight. Through refinement, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. It basically tells two other bounty hunter cutters, Ed and Choco. They left him joining the group. It is difficult, can use any kind of weapon, and it will use good looks if needed. <br /> They get involved in a scam that Clarmont, a bailman, is going to. Along the way, the band starts a reality television show, and where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green become involved. They are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this. <br /> I think the story was fun and it was some laugh. The correction did not bother me. There are also a lot of violence, especially using weapons, and blood. It could be a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to look.
