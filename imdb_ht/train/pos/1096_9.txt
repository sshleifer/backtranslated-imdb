I saw this first movie in 1980 in the movie film spot. After many people come back (and buying in the video) it always makes me laugh loudly. <br /> Yes, it's kind of another age - a domestic comedy set in America's middle-class but well-executed class is well executed. But it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-optimistic warfare, the baby's boom and the age-old consumer. This movie has no "guilty" fun. <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated performers - urban Melvyn Douglas; abrogate Cary Grant; Dafli to determine Myrna Loy - complement each other with a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene - "That means we have to blast" with "Miss Stellwaggen" and "this little piggy". <br /> Love it.
