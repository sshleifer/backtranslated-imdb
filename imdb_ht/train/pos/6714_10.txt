Why did I enjoy the latest episode show? Because of the true talent Melissa Joan Hart and his support he had to demonstrate that white, comedy, light-hearted humor, and deep thinking could actually coexist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I could come home from work a hard day, and bust a smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to look like this magic person was so happy while helping others. Sabrina was a hero of my opinion ... though he was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own ... very different; He has the power of his finger, will, and order that could be used for good or bad that can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most things we see, have, know about, own, or even desires ... can be used for good or bad, and how we choose to define it, define who we are. <br /> She traveled the globe and other realms with the constant ideas and without mercy of yourself ... to learn, to live, laugh, and love. She has always learned how to improve her ability to benefit from all around her; he made mistakes while he lived life, went on different journeys of growth, as he, his aunt, and Salem (mekon√®, but imperfect heroes) did well to demonstrate that even in error, you can always be noble, gifted, and wonderful. <br /> She also demonstrated a lot of gut, learning, and acting acts as she went on her way. If this is not enough enough for 10 stars in this world to tear world where people are so hostile toward each other, do not realize how the differences are spice life rather than a reason to kill ... Then I do not know what. This show was most certainly a journey to a better world as well as an inspiration to be best ourselves with a gift intended to bust a smile on our chop ... I heard about a doctor before that all I mentioned above leads to a "healthy" health ... and is not all we need? :)
