Eddie Murphy spent his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magic kidnapped kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asked to help him to rescue this kid from the clutches of evil himself. The story is a bit comical, it never feels sorry, despite the hilarity of the comedy in the whole movie; Charles Dance cut-off comedy with its many serious and black features of the evil that keeps the child hostage. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is very funny, action packed and really quite compelling in a spacious, almost magical way. <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
