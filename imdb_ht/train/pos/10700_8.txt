This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you are pretending to know or care what communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and not hurt the conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeded to avoid being completely out-bored by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does well. The final moves, and logic - logic movie, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
