It might not be the best movie in 2006 but it was just a movie that excited and thought about.The Sentinel is a good political film cast that looks similar to or even borrows some elements of other movie films such as in the line of fire and candidate mandates. The basic draw of this movie is similar to other movies like this: A draw to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas star as Secret Agent Agent Garrison Service that spearheads the surgery only to find out later that he was framed. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a silver rookie under the guidance of Silver Breckinridge and Academy Awards winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this movie could have more action as it is by some sources considered as an Action movie as a movie thriller but a good thing about this movie is instead of just a murder plot to kill the US President, He also worries a melee (treason) of the Secret Service led the President in the wrong direction.
