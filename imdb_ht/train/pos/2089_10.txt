"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you do not hear much about yet. There are a lot of great disasters and events, but it is also a love story that is not passionate. All this happens in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good for long periods. <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for a limited role. It basically only has three emotions: submissive, hunger, and heartbreak. Performances by the Asian and Asian-American actors are terrific. <br /> <br />
