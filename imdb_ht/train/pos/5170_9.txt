I rented this movie when it came out on video tapes and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it several times since. I should agree with the others when they said American Summer was Nostalgic film. When I look it I hope I might be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all love the movie to some extent. We have always wanted that we could relive our lives as children of knowledge / adult knowledge. Is it not good for you to have all your friends / parents again young? No worry about your work, being a parent etc. ... I know that I would like to fly into a De Lorean and go back in time. While I've been enjoying the film many times I've ever loved movie movie though it's dumpling with Bill Murray. I hope they could make an American summer version of this.
