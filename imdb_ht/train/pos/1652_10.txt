This series made me to write Deighton and the way I was younger and I love this presentation in the story. I would however agree with the comments above. From what I have read in the past, it's not the performance leading Deighton deny that the series has been released, but the blind that all three books were received in the screen translation. A great example of this is the rewrite of the transient crossing that ended Samson's field of career. The scene is not in the book, the dead character of the trap is never in any of the books and the crossing of sinker came from East Germany in western Germany, by the Polish border. This entire scenario is fabric. These changes are the same as the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he presented the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defeat's excellent and I believe he behaved well in showing aging silver agents desperately trying to bridge bridges into the classroom. Samson both paid for his father's idealism and suffered from his influence on his life. As commentary Clevemore, he became himself an education he would probably have run the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is reduced when compared to Samson in the book - a physically impressive person who can use his size to impose a presence.
