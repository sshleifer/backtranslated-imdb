Adolescent Eddie spends his life being intimidated and outraged by his mania and heavy metal music. One day he found out her hero Sammi Curr died, supposedly burned by the facility who wanted to stop a music. But Eddie has his latest record, never released, and when he plays it he begins to receive messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Before Sammi was revealed he intended to return to the life of the local Halloween party to take precise revenge on the city that once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Complete with humor and jokes, this is a very fun movie. Sammi himself is an original movie cinema movie, playing on the obsessions of the obsessive 'rock music' of the 80's. Well worth seeing.
