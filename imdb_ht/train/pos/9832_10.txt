Wow This was a great Italian film "ZOMBIE" by the Luci Fulci great director ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL of the LIVE") Lucio started this movie and was so sick that Bruno was great to take over and it turned out amazing better than I expected it to turn out so if you saw the "HELL OF THE LIFE DIE" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and liked Both the one or the one term then this is a movie you have to look at having big "ZOMBIE" make-up equal witch great looking "ZOMBIES" has a funny "ZOMBIE" head flying! With the "ZOMBIE" bird you spit and you spin into a "ZOMBIE" (only Happed To The Two People) but mostly just the toxic toxic "ZOMBIES" like Bruno Matties "HELL of the Dead". So, if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or just the "ZOMBIE" movie in general than checking this out its great Italian movie "ZOMBIE"!
