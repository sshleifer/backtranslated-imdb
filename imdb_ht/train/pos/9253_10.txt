Well, the movie is not exactly "funny." Okay, I admit, there are some human lines, but definitely nothing is laugh-out-loud funny. For example: Right before a sex scene steam between Eleniak and one of her men's costumes, she is lying in bed and she can not remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, she says, "Well, do not go anywhere." <br /> Look, funny, but not funny. Acting is very good. <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. It's hot and sexy and there's a really steamy scene with him that someone can not help but delay and re-look. There are also some other sexy scenes with it and there are some very provocative lines. <br /> Overall, 5 stars. I would only give him three if not for Erika Eleniak.
