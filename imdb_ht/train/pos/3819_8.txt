I was hoping to see this film for a long time and at last I could manage to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Perhaps because I expect too much from this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best movie in Korea but it still really worth watching. <br /> <br /> The subject was nice and the movie makes you keep watching without getting bored even if it is long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, acting in Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and I think this movie should not be so nice if it was not in the leading role.
