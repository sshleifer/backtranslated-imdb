Critics, who say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed the Bug's life a bit more. I can not recall an Pixar animation, other than the movie game story, that I laughed so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. The voice voices are what makes this film. Dave Foley is a serious person who gets himself into many issues. Hopper is a superb characterization by Kevin Spacey's still beautiful, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There are also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and off. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It misses social messages in Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
