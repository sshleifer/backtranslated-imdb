Three sergeants of the British army stationed in India, are sent out to suspend an uprising of a tribe of thieves known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Knives, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees lead by the disaster guru. Gunga Din, the boy's water boy, went back to the camp for help with the other two sisters to go after him, but they were also captured. Now the largest sends a complete detail out after the three, but does not realize that they are walking in a trap set by thieves. It is though, Gunga Din has saved the day. Excellent movie friends, though it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks provide very funny and thrilling performances and Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli is extremely disaster as Guru. Rating-10 from 10.
