(Sorry for my default language, I do not have native speaker ...) <br /> Yes, this is a movie that almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally, I agree on all these supremes around. But I will not use this bloodless semidetal road to describe the movie here. Because these people are "perfect! Only-to-be! Best-ever!" - Review makes some people turn away (including me). So, if you're looking for another 'Hamlet' that has potential to rival and many theaters with those cinemas - then do not miss this one, if you reach it anywhere. (Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it. It seems there is no outdoor DVD, and the German version version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format.) <Br /> Just in case you decide to get a copy: Spare out that cut two hours (or so) version of this movie. It is not used and no fun, and it provides a bad impression of a movie, which deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture. And it also cripples down to 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Hello from Germany, F.L.
