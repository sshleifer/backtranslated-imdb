I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it for a positive and largely true portrait of the faith of the LDS. I think a remake of this epic journey across the plains should be beneficial, since many today are not familiar with the trials and persecution faced by the early Mormon Church. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted person. As a member of the Church, one of the most disturbing aspects of the film (most of the historic historians did not bother me much) was painted in Brigham Young as one who was "church deceived" to church members in believing He was called to be the successor of Joseph as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reason for this line, it creates the impression that its doubts in this regard are historical facts, when in fact, both Brigham and the bulk of Church members understand and believe firmly They called them Church Lead. Brigham did not deliberately mislead the people of God; rather it has led them confidence by inspiration. The important point for Mormon because of it is an important aspect of our faith: God truly speaks to the prophet today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet. or do not believe this statement or not, just know that the movie does not show what Brigham himself believed.
