This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talent and beauty of Marion Davies. It is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this movie. (I believe Lucille Ball can model her later career on Davies style, which would be called "Zany Beauty".) Vidor's direction is light, but sure-but the story is a chestnut neck but the act is beautiful The contemporary thing, and the star-looking element for fans of the era are silent, and many guardians, add to fun in general. It combines the elements of slapstick and adult drama with good old timeless romance very well. For all film fans with a knee-jerk reaction they are watching silent films, sitting in this one and can change your mood. <br /> <br />
