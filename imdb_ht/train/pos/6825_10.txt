I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes's Opening Night. The first movie in it that I've seen seems to be on a larger scale, so it feels more mainstream, but it still does not feel as if he sits himself any more than he has in his previous movie . That's probably what makes it so intense. There is also an undoubtedly cathartic thing about watching this movie. <br /> It is about what in fact Cassavetes made a staple of his career, an ideal that he expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here to express it before. Rowlands's character, actress full-length actress Myrtle Gordon, can not bring himself to play his role in the next production as written for her uncalculatedly following impulse after impulse, causing a disorder on stage, until she finds one right. It is a luxurious abode site. This is a movie that does not fail to take the natural wheel that one goes through during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does much of the things he does, and he sees and even describes as something destructive, yet he just might be the best thing for him. It can be a cleaning rather than a breakdown. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, it all ends in a merger. Cassavetes gives his character a real brutal touch, which is that early in, it is bust to argue that he has nothing in common with his character, but it is in quiet but emotionally opposing corridor fear is true. /> The latest scene, the climatic performance that Myrtle shares with a characteristic curly character from it who acts with him is one of the most exciting, hilarious, hard-hit, energetic, and enjoyable moments I've ever had see in a movie.
