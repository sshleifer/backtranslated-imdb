I love this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is good if it's not a little host as it's always been. As stated, the music is very good, and it has a moisture that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> But one major draw hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks into it. It is established that the light does not work in the vault. Do you think the Columbo is very smart or the rest of the police would have thought to check whether the light bulb worked? You would think in very short order they would cut the bulb and get the score. This award is television whodunit fiction, and various holes will still be found, but this seems very too blatant. <br /> It really does not make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light does not work but the "bed of death" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days.
