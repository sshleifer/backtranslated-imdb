I was not only an extra in this movie, I got to see it in Boston in a movie theater. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans have kept themselves in a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... on them .. Sox redhead fans! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star are this wonderful comedy about love and lust. The love is between two young lovers. The service is for the red sax to win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. It is funny enough and it gets the most laugh. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. At times, I felt support to actress Skye Skye would be a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
