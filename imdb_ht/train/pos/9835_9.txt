Off the blocks left me just saying that I'm a big fan of zombies so I do not make statements like the above lightly. Secondly let me say that this is an Italian zombie film with Fulci only directing 15 minutes into it before handing over Bruno (Rats, Night of Horror) to Mattei. This is no Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That said this is unlikely one of the most fun zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty awesome. Just check out the scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> The zombies come across varieties. From moaning shufflers, to manicured manic skates, to birds! <br /> <br /> The gore is abundant. Legs are biting off, arms amputated, open burst open. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is fast, jumping from a zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there's the head of the fridge. Oh the top of the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horrors since Ash was his hands owned by Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should know already if you are the sort of person who will love this sort of movie. Find some peers and some beer and you will be in for a fun night. <br /> <br /> Do I mention the top of the fridge?!?!?
