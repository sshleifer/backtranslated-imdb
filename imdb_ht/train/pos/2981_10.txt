Why the crap is this movie rated so low? I saw this film more than 25 times, I know each line in this movie. It is obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creator of South Park and the new Team Puppet Team) stars as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mostly they're just referring to them as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie begins to remind us of the corrupt hungry world of sports more money starts, they even go as far as they make up one called "Townsell." I have to cite this portion of the movie since it's true and some sports begin: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, St. Louis, one year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus a season as the biggest Desert Inn I am happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami. "His agent leaned over:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school meeting party, and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old peers. Outside to create BASEketball in sports after being challenged by what probably was the high school basketball hero. After you make the sport go pro in about a year. During this time they managed to recruit third team breaks crack, which is actually a day after the game invented. As the film follows we find that Coop, Remer, and Crack are the only sporting sports hero left. The story follows with blackmail, Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and so absurd humor it will let you cry for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious.
