A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Very well done with Polanski doing well that the diffused entroverta tries hard to adapt to Paris's parody lenjgings and its fellow luggage. Grieve early because they mean their own self-obsessed fellow tenants and fears later about how he develops his defense that will ultimately be suppressing him. Personally, I could do without the cross dressing element but I accepted the psycho head and the fact that he had some logic, giving in to the storyline. But he could have worked without and would remove elements of little theater, but then perhaps what was done because the yard certainly seemed to take on the look of a theater at the end. I can not help feeling that there are more than a few of the guys' own feelings of not a 'real' French and Jewish boots. Still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
