In a poor village in Mexico, the Colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives with his wife Latha (Marisa Paredes) his wife in an old house. Lola still scrubs the death of Augustine children a few days ago. The Colonel hopes for his pension to fighter a war against the Catholic Church for nearly twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the present government wants to forget this old fight. Without their possession or money, but a significant gamecock, they struggle to survive and wait for the letter of recognition from the government, recognizing the law and paying for late retirement. This film slowly and touch reflects the social and financial situation of most of the seniors retired from third world countries. In Brazil, most of the retired people have to survive with US $ 80.00 per month. The debts of the Colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a destitute. The outstanding performance cast, in a very sad story that is reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> Title (Brazil): (Do not Write to Coronel) (Do Not Write the Colonel) <br /> <br />
