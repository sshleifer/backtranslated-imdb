Busy Phillips put in a hell of a performance, both comedy and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good but Occupy stole the show. It was a nice touch after the Smokers, a movie started to handle, that was not all that great. If nobody gets a nomination of any kind for this movie it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, look at Home Room.
