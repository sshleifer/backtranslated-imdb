Probably ever my movie, a story of despair, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it does not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, although I've seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very pretty sympathetic roles, is a pleasure. Children, as grandma says, more like "lunchtime" than children, but only makes them more enjoyable to watch. And wake up slowly the mom of what's happening in the world and under his own roofs are credible and thrilling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would all be "up" for this movie.
