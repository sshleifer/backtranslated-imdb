I did not wait much in this movie, but it was very surprising foreclosure, as it is light and humorous and beautifully observed. The central trick of deadbeat cyclist was surprisingly likable as they dumped and lowered their way to the drug-centric trips to Wales. The humor was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (sympathetic treatments in the little old lady store). Atmospheric in rural Wales were captured perfectly, and the band was very well selected. Maledly carefully scripted, carefully to detail - I have never seen such a realistic realism in alternative culture - I felt I was with them. Very light in touch and full of pleasure - not what you might expect from a movie about cyclists and drugs. A fun on all fronts, and hard to criticize, though I thought of the recent scenes were a bit humanity - the movie should end when leaving Wales. But in general, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
