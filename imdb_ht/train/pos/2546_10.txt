This is just about in the same league as the 'Black Cat', although I would give this a 9 rather than a 9+. This praises indeed for a movie that was so badly mistaken that it is amazing! <br /> <br /> `The invisible Ray is party horror, party drama and certainly part of sci-fi. For a movie that took place in 1936 the science element was good before them in time. The blend of drama, drama and sci-fi are a perfect mix, while the act on the part of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures a lot of elements that Whale James did so often. What I say is that this movie is weird and quite injection. The scene and the outgels out of Lugosi's room are a perfect example of the mood. It's an emerging moment in the movie, which is so sadly lacking in today's movies in the genre. Like the `Black Cat 'and' Island of Lost Souls', I can not understand why this movie has yet to be released on DVD. Considering some of the junk that has already been transferred to DVDs in that much more unearthly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you get the chance. When it's released on DVD capture it quickly and put it in an honored place in your DVD library.
