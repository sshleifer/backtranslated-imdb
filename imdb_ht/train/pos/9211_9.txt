Action, horror, sci-fi, director of Fred Olen Ray explains that he has some talent as a director. Character actor William Smith is one of the hardest / bad guys in the industry. It treats the viewer with the best performance in acting in his career. As for Randy Travis she bestowed Lee Van Cleef's impressions. It's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the film. As for the rest of one of the cast they really stand out. Ray did a great job that led to this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this western B to a scale of one to ten (the best ten) a seven.
