I do not know why people think this is like a bad movie. She has a very good scheme, some good action, and change in place for Harry does not hurt either. Ensure some of its offensive and free hands but this is not the movie just like that. Eastwood is in the lofty room of Harry's room, and I loved Pat Hingle in this movie as the little town cop. If you like DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this one, it's a lot better than the TELEPHONE PAYMENT. 4/5
