Being a otaku since Robotech day, I can always say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime of all time. Considering when it's done, the animation is of high quality. There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the pleasure of watching the movie. Although she was described as being "creamy," she should keep in mind that women do not react in the same way that men do. Since the main character is a girl, it should be obvious that it does not necessarily need to resort to "macho-man" tactics in order to find the respect of his peers. The Seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like 3-dimensional a cartoon can be found; Her personality captures the essence of a spiritual little girl who first appears to be completely discouraged but at the end succeeds in the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked a bit like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather dubious "Laser Homing" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than wrapped in a huge velvet dress around his head in true Dracula style). I doubt that the scene was meant to be funny, but it split me up. But all in all, I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 host of all time.
