Harman and Old Pond Mill Isings' are a true true to the art of animation. The competent and artistic skill that characterizes this duo work is nowhere more of evidence than in this cartoon. It's a shame that many people can see only offense in what, and it was always intended to be, an interesting light piece of entertainment that in no way sought to delegate black people. If anything it is a tribute to the infectious and musicality humor in the black race. I could not see this jam for many years as the 'race commander' in England was considered too offensive to be shown in multi-Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy I'd like to see this masterpiece again. I think those who regularly look for messages and intentions that have never been meant to those cartoons, which, after all, sixty years old, should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a place very different today, but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what has been seen in the past.
