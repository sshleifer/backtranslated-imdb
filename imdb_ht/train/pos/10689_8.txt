As usual, Hollywood stereotypes everyone in the movie. But this one is a classic - from the banker over white collar to the Russian woman! Well done. Even the facial expressions were great! Language was perfect (even in Russian) and Nicole did a splendid job !! Hey guys - you get what you pay for :)
