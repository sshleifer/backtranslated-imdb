Only see this show a few times, but they will live in my memory. <br /> It is very frustrating that it is so hard to find that anywhere to buy and yet have to seem to be endless repeat of things like Friends! Especially even more difficult to find being in England i guess ...? <br /> They say it was low ratings or was it a complaint at the Bakersfield PD themselves? Perhaps it was just too smart for certain people? <br /> <br /> Whatever, just about the one comedy I would like to see again, but it is almost impossible to find. I heard it was being or was repeated in another network? But alas not over here !! <br /> Summary: ingenious.
