The only explanation I can think of why this movie is not widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some. This film was a truly happy surprise, satire is engineering. This movie turns the lights off into the darkness of organized religions and great media, with the scurry to cover. Rent the DVD and watch it for yourself if you have not yet, this movie succeeds to many who have failed (Dogma coming to mind) from its stinging nose to the tent, both using humor and very clever analogy coupled with say effects and location. Can not comment in depth without revealing some significant defaulters, some surprises in this movie that even the seasoned film winter will be kept in custody.
