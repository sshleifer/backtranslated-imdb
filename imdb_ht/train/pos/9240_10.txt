Found this flick in a videostore, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie feels really bad! The so-called colonel, who would be the hero here if the cover could be trusted, must be in his eighties, it is barely able to walk. He somehow managed to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story left the colonel, making sense to give the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning, a now two terrifyly eighty-looking guy to take over, to what was to be some sort of story. I lost bloody times, but did not mind, because the movie is so bad, it's real pleasure to watch. Zero-budget garbage and actors do not deserve this name. Go check it out!
