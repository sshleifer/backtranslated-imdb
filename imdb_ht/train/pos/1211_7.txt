I grew up on this movie and I can remember when my brother and I used to play in the yard and pretend we were in Care-A lot. Now, after many years spent, I get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy. If you are parenting and you did not watch this movie with your children, then you should, just keep you in your arms and watch them get thrilled to care for their bear and care-a-lot ! Singing, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all the kids so they can learn how enjoyable care for others! When it comes down to the garbage that's on TV, you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life and movies like these.
