Radio was not a 7days 24 hours a week ago when I grew up in the England 1930s, so the child in the air was treated for me when we had batteries with an accumulation of power supply. The few programs I've heard have therefore made a great impression on my teenage minds, and the 3 that I remember always are "Toytown", one over all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking Of the animals he knew, which he called "my brother". It was only recently that I learned that Gray Owl was not a genuine "American", but paid the tax paid by the Chief Sioux to make my great sense of "A man gets what he dreams". Would that we could all dream as changing worlds and benefit as Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Would a new Owl Gray be influenced by world leaders in cleaning the environment.
