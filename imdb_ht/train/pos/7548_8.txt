Short, but long enough, cat soup is a very wild journey to watch. One day, I was just searching for my on-demand list in the anime section and came across it, and decided to watch it. I've spent the whole time basically sitting with Agape jaws. Ever since I've been either empty in thinking, or had a one that has been called "turn it off !!!". But I did not. And actually, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is stunning. Very artistic, odd and dark. I personally liked it for the amazing animation, but the seemingly empty story behind it is equally compelling for myself. <br /> A young boy - well, cats - go in search of his soul's soul. In the first part he lay sick of the bed, and he is soon paid by a visit to a sort of grim rapper. His soul is divided into half. One recaptured by the cat boy while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the movie is a little lost to me, honestly. I hope to return, and the worlds ... maybe slowly fall apart? Perhaps his absence in soul is the answer behind this, for the rest of the movie has several stages in which the inch of the world has a giant flood, and its next dries up into a weak desert, and then everything frozen (thanks to either what God or fate, as you will see). Then I believe that they find the soul's soul in the form of an orange flower. And the whole world disappears. Haha, totally did not get that, but it sent shivers down my spine every time. Although it's a random scene, I'm sure there's a deepest message behind it if you look it enough and do some research. Personally, I LOVE Trippy things like this, and would like to spend time doing this just to understand it. But in some people it's probably not the cups of tea. It comes as very disturbing, so if you like your right animated forward, this is not a movie for you. If you have an open mind but however, I highly recommend this movie.
