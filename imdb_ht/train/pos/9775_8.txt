Tears of Kali is an original original movie film that delves into the functions of a cult group in India consisting of German psychologists who learned how to control the additions and their bodies to the points that they can cause others to be "cured" in radical techniques (which can trigger hallucinations of nightmare and physical pain and torture) to release the pent-up demons inside them. The movie shows as a series of stickers on the Taylor-Eriksson group - top-notch cult group. The first segment is a bit slower than the rest but it serves fine to set up the site for the rest of the movie. The rest of it plays like a mindf @ ck movie and some of the key staples dropping into the mix (full-front nidite, some gore) keep you happy. <br /> I say checking this out. Can not be spectacular, but it's the concept of beautiful neato and is delivered in the right spots. 8/10.
