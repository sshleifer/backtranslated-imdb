Diane Keaton has given an exceptional performance in this rather silly but humorous story that involves quite a few young people and deep secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "Family Family", '05, which has only one daughter and loves her beyond words can describe. He always called her and said, "Surrender Dorothy," an expression used in the Oz 'Wizard, 1939. A car crash suddenly came up with Natalie becoming himself deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially true to all actors to support.
