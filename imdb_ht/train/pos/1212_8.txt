Career Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not all a bad movie. In fact, I love it very much. Yes I admit the dialogue is cornea and the story is a bit wrong told at times. But Darkheart, while very pretty dark is a convincing enough form of change, and Hadley Kay made a superb job to his voice. Speaking of the voice to act, it was great, nothing wrong with it too. The colorful animation, and some of the visuals are particularly awesome at the beginning. The songs and notes are beautiful, mostly growing up and forever Young, the latter was my favorite personal favorite. The care, whom I love, is adorable, and the human kids are well done. And the finish is a real tearjerker. All in all, kiddie flood fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
