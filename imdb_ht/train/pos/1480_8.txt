I am now in front of the TV, watching Casomai. It's changing, it's idle or better ... crappy. It begins with a courier wedding in the two protagonists where they love the stories reported. After that change everything, a child was born, and the rest usually came to a couple. It's a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and this is the movie center. He does not want to show us something in particular, nothing new, it's just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and its normality has become different from the rest. It is also a flashing film, everything is short, each scene is long just a few seconds. It's a story reported, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinions are central, the views of creating the story and destroying it. It's a simple story of a couple as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a couple, everything should be, it is, but I'm sure every one of you will want to know what happen, so do not forget to look at the end!
