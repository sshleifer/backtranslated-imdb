I have not read the book that this was based on / inspired by. That being some of the (other movie role films) the last job of John Ritter (RIP), one hopes he is hilarious. And it is. Almost every time he was present in this, as a matter of fact. Most of the cast, as well as regular, play in each other well, and the material tends to be great. She plays Paul Hennessy, father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy at this age, Kerry, the mid-child depression that fights for cause and awareness, and Bridget, the fashion-loving, popular ditz. Sagal makes a return to being the female lead to a site-com, and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy. The show changed somewhat after Mr. Three Companies spent on them, and for a while they could not seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughter, or being intensely and sure be respected. One can ask how or why it lasted long ago that: It could still be good, some of the additions were fortunate (if you like David Spade, most of his party consists of him doing his schtick) and te there are things to say. My favorite personal episode is in the last season. The humor is a beautiful mix of "mute" jokes (especially related to high school), silliness, black comedy and bit materials. This was faced with sex and other adult subjects, but never in a graphical way. The language is light and, on occasion, moderately strong. I recommend this to any fan of those who did it. 8/10
