This is a hot, humorous film, in the same vein as the works of Almodovar. Make sure she has a 10 year old boy sucking milk out of breasts, but the style is so playful that I can not understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted (but I should want to leave 10 - Does my old son play the part? Not so sure!). Spanish movies are often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of sight or kink. I think that if we are the European kind of North would have the same attitude, we would be better as a result. This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious character 'Fartman Maurice'. As his lover said, 'Most people are embarrassed about farting. You turn it into an art form. '
