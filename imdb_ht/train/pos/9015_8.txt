At the beginning, this one is from England, so, of course, I was 98% lucky that it will be clever and pretty good movies. I never heard of this movie before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here is the coming feminine version of my Left footage. I was fine, but I was also wrong. Wrong because the two movies are very different. My left foot is a movie John Ford looks like this one is a movie same Chaplin (not because this is funny, but Chaplin in this great melodrama that brings tears in your eyes.) I was fine because In 1990 beautiful Daniel Jou Lewis turned a bit ugly by playing a disabled person and made it a great sense of reality. Here, very nice Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Bonham-Carter lacks one of the greatest women's parties in the 1990's, and Emily Lloyd's Breaking Wave. Gee! And watch her eyes! She has the most beautiful eyes in movies since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also a true talent, as seen on many other movies. Look at this one, you will not regret it! With a beautiful work by Branagh too!
