After all these years I still considered this series the finest example of the World War II documentary film. Interviews with many participants in all countries are set apart in any other project. It is good to see a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) Take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they all go. With modern technology for improving old archive footage and lots of information that has been deployed since 1974 when the World of War produced, an upgrade version of this series should be welcomed. The History Channel has made some fine shows related to many aspects of WWII, but an expansive series like the World of War has not been successfully tried since the original. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. It is necessary to look.
