Well, well .... Roeg touched a bit of a nerve, did not it read? It was a genius while categorizing its various cartoon characters in psychosis for a couple of decades, but as soon as it had bad badness to suggests that redemption (or even some good advice) could be found in The old church's old old neighborhood, the film's film-filmmaking film has become more vicious. Worse still, Theresa Russell's character - faced with experience that nothing in rationalist outlook had an explanation for, is not wanting to force them to cope with these experiences on another level - that's the spiritual. You know, the domain of ignorance and superstition, the sort of thing the art-cinephiles homes are supposed to be above. Oh, the horror ... So she found her marriage - the idea that it could be a uniquely important commitment - confirmed by what looks uncomfortably like divine intervention. Those who get this idea of ​​the offensive facial may be wondering why they are instinctively flying in attack mode in being challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably will not. Sure, this movie has some problems, and Shire's talial talial is brave as a surprise now, 1950s-style attire and all. And dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest at the last stage is straight from the Spellbound School of glib interpretation (though Hitchcock's movie escapes even charges due to the source of wisdom that has exclusive email scans as a Freudian psychoanalyst) . But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have cut a critically mauling criticism for even asking the question as for the possible answers to this movie presented.
