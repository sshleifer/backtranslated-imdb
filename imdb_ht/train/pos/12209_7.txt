I was very impressed with this small, unattended photo. The story, about a pair of social savings that encounters, gets friends, and gives one another and a support system both seemed to miss like children, is in hilarious times, in sad times but still provocative. Music, especially by Sub-Group, has been used great effect, such as experimentation with camera angles, filters, and quick or fast motion techniques. The performances (leads are played by the writers and directors of the movie) are some of the best I've seen in the couple in recent years. If you ever feel like a square pinion forced into a round spot, I really believe you will appreciate "No Hook or By Crook".
