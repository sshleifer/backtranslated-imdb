What is very French about this movie is the time to set up the two leading characters. This might require a bit of patience, especially since neither is "attractive" to the typical Hollywood definition of these. However, once the "heist" kicks off, the film rushes forward, perhaps at times too fast. But it is a real Rollercoaster ride and if you do not look too close it is all quite credible. Types of films that you know Hollywood would have botched up.
