Simon Pegg plays a great rude and often out of celebrity journalism control that carried out England to work for a great American magazine. Of course, it has created all kinds of complications. Funny comedy-based comedy star Kristen Dunst (starred), Danny Huston, and Jeff Bridges. It works primarily because we love Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to her despite her frequent UPS vices. I liked the movie. It's not all and finished all but it was a nice way an evening's evening to sit on the couch watching movie cinema. <br /> 7 out of 10
