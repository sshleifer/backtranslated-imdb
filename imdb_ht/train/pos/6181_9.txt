A very enjoyable movie, giving you know how to watch old music / mystery. It may not come near Agatha Christie or even Mystery Mystery as a noir movie, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's put on a show" music backstage. As a music, it's not Busby Berkley or Friday fun, but it can boost the classic "Coctails for Two" and the unusual "Sweet Marijuana". The movie runs in real time during a stage show, opening night of the "Vanities", where a murderer - and soon another - discovering sliders. Does the killer find out before the curtain falls? Be sure, but the search is fun, though somewhat predictable and march by crises in funny rescue (Odds in the shape of the goddess kissing in the choir girls, Toby Wings). The stupid stomach is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is just a bit too weird, the lad's lady is a bit too messy, bitchy prima to donna bit too bitchy, and the romantic waist a bit too self you sacrificed, but as stereotypes go, they are very stylish. There's a really gorgeous chorus contest of girls, who are even better than girls for a Berkley musical musical in the same period, which sometimes tend to be a bit on the left. Yes, this movie could be better than it is, and the number Ellington Duke is a troublesome, but if you like to dive into old movies, this proves to be a tantalizing journey.
