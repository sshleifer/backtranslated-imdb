Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) said in prison about a perfect Heist. Before she is behind bars and can not do it herself she left her at her girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) .Soon there are five guys organizing the five-man crime and the little bit little ability.Brang Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002) .It is a crime comedy that's often very funny. You can not help but laugh when everything goes wrong with these guys. Some big actors are playing these character.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interests Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Peru's love interests Carmela.George Clooney ( also producer) play Jerzy, the tattoo guy in a wheelchair.This is a very fun flick. I certainly recommend it.
