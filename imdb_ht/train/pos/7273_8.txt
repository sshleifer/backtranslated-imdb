Carlos Mencia was excellent this is special hour. He worked hard to show everyone he was the real deal. I know people have said that he was stolen material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy up the road he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, so it's so good. The people say it's not funny because he said Dee dee was too much, and still did not realize that part of his act, and did not want it so, but he carried it like that anyway, and succeed in make people laugh. For all those who are sick outside, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring it down.
