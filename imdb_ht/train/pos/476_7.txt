A brilliant chess player goes to a tournament and falls in love with a woman she meets. On top of this this would be a very bad angle on a story. So, there are more. There is the fact that the player failure is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance in the game and the reality has some stories to hack the player. <br /> <br /> This stage film returns with ideas from romantic frivolity to tension competition in historical events that form the chess player and works quite nicely. It's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easily believe they might hit it off together as the way to do this movie. The added effect of the competition is very good too and creates a nice tension environment. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of the chess players as I do not play the game myself, but it looks nice and credible. All in all, most of the movie goes down very easily. It is also forgotten very easy though. So it's nice to look, but there's nothing more than that. <br /> 7 out of 10 chess failures keep between a rook and a hard place
