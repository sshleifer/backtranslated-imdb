I never saw this film until I bought the tape last year. I was enthralled and entertained. It has all the elements in what I like to see in a sci-fi story, in a book or on the screen. There is a society of comments, speculation, and a good story. <br /> There is something weird, and fun, watching a 1936 view of 'the future' in the 60s and 70s. I think it's a must see, and not just for Sci-Fiers.
