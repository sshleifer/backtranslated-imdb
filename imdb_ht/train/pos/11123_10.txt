Hello from this guy :) :) <br /> I believe Sopranos are one of the best productions ever, having facts and mixing fiction in a way, that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as Godfather! James Gandolfini fits in the paper as a glove! I would like the Sopranos would never end at all. It's perfect! It should be a topic of school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay up to the finish episode, so now i bought all the episodes in DVD format and i watching all the home bouts before and after dinner and I'm getting addicted, as I did with jail break. In my opinion Prison Break and Sopranos are the best-ever set for TV. The argument both is splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations to these works. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my English. Thank you for reading.
