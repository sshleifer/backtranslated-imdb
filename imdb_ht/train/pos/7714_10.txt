There was a lot of Sci-Fi's 50 movies. They were great draw for Drive-in theaters. A lot of them were wrong then back then. This film and 'Earth Day stood still' standing out, and both are age well in their own way. From the very beginning and its strange therym notes music (which still sounds strangely since the thorns hardly ever used) banned Planet takes you where no man goes before. Speaking of Star Trek has plenty of material in this movie that has happened in Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain / first mate / doctor, the crazy scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirts, computer intelligence; it is all from nowhere but it was the first of its kind. In addition, it has a great deal of good works and performs artworks that even today recalls a certain shake of the imagery. Consider the great Krell machine successfully displaying with some real profiles. I saw this as a kid (in a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course every movie that was even vaguely scared back then, but I remember being really worried about the invisible monster. Banned Planet is a movie of a sci-fi fan can look back and find something new with every look.
