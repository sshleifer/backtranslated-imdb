First, if you're planning on watching this, make sure you look at the version of UNCUT (although it's very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that are puzzled and due to censorship), it's a big one difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father. When his father suddenly passes away, he is able to go out of the world on his own. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophy of life, she used her sexuality to manipulate men in giving her what she wanted and leaving them in breaking and desperate for her love. Throughout the film it has become increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder it has any sense of morality left at all. In general, baby's face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. While no sexual acts are clearly shown on the screen, it's very obvious what happens on the camera. <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie so much and I believe the most modern audience will find at least some fun out if it, especially with the movie shock value. I thought while watching her that the rhythm seemed somewhat slow in part, but I think that most movies are the first time to see them. Actually, I think almost all of the movies I've seen made out of the early 30 had some minor rhythm problems or some parts just did not quite "shed" right. This was probably just the film-making craft was not well perfected yet ?? it would take just a few more years. Compare a movie from 1939 and compare it with a 30's movie early and I think you'll see what I mean. Again, I'm very happy I could look off the original; it really does make a big difference. Also any fan of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in a uncharacteristic role.
