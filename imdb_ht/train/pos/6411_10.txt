This is one of the best military films ever to do. And it's great because of its focus on value. It is a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honoring, loyalty, love, and determination. <br /> Buy and DeNiro are superb in the lead roles. It's wonderful to see racist masterpiece rising to respect and love through determination Carl Brashear, driving, and yes, honesty. The title indicates the source of bail. I never noticed until this last time watching her look how Carl Lumbly's brilliantly painted Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it is a pole in the movie that Carl's memory of his father helps to bring him in hard times. <br /> I'm selective about what movie I buy. This is one of the rare ones I want on my shelves. It will see many times in the future, I'm sure.
