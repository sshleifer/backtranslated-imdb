Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaptation yet. Not surprising, since the king himself wrote the scenario. The story follows the belief family relocated to a beautiful Maine home. One of the other residents is Jw, a wonderful old man who knows some things about the area. One highway runs straight into the yards. The other is a path leading to Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried animals killed by the highway. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cats, Churches, are found dead. Luckily, this happens during the family, with the exception of Louis (Dad), is away from Thanksgiving. You took Louis to another burial ground, beyond the Pet Sematary, where the church was to be buried. And Louis is welcomed (not so polite) by the Church. He returned, appearing to be wet his way out of the bag she was buried in. Perhaps she was buried alive. Maybe not. There is nothing I can say without damaging the story. In all the royal adaptations I saw this would be most frightening. The real characters and the usual situations. Mary Lambert performs a great work-directed procedure. Suspension is kept fairly high throughout the film, due to part of the development of plot. The scene where Gage killed is to stick to yourself forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what happens, but Lambert pulls some real scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments. <br /> In general, this is a good movie with an excellent adaptation. If you enjoy being scared and not mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then "Pet Sematary" is just what you are looking for. Fantasy fans will not want to avoid that.
