Set in a middle class neighborhood of the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a game touches light and obsessive Americans as weapons and violence, materialism and keeping up with Joneses, fearing others people, slavery, golf, and disposition for the deceased. Yes, it sounds a bit heavy, but trusts me, it's almost as light as a pen. <br /> <br /> Zombies are featured important among the characters. The important questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of how Willard chooses this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies do bidding like robots (they became a brand of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can work out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the living scenario (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), kept this improbable percussive material together for an hour and a half without once being angry for a good ri. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Black Nights and Sonja Bennett are directors, assisted by K'Sun young as Timmy, the innocent kid and a good hearts that act as fair witnesses to all the graphics of the grownups. (When viewed only in "Memo" and "The Matrix," I had no idea that Ms. Moss had comedy comedy comedy.) The production and music design is exclusive to 50s, in a small one. Perhaps this one is not for everyone. It surely will be a tough movie beating my Bizarro annual award. But clever comedies comic comics from the start of their finish are among the most realistic of film-making. For me every way, "Fido" is a hood! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (View on 01/30/07)
