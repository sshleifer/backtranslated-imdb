All good movies "inspire" some direct flick of video copying. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really a good movie, because I did not see any movie that had nothing distant to resemble anything Roman on the new releases shelves for months. Then I locate the latest Full Moon offering, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series, with bloody dolls, but never saw one of the non-killer puppies films. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus story is happening in a group of cars in the hills of the Alps. One of their colleagues, James, found a cave with brilliant old tools, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it over. It gets possession, and, as the demonic Tyrannus gladiator, is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse, who is the real Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Granted, like many full moon films, this has little or no budget. At times, the correction and direction was so amateur I would swear I watched the Witch Project in Blair. The attempts to cut off the branches and head remind me of a monty Python Monty. The weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic-y. It literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends and a digital camcorder over a weekend. Granted, there is nothing wrong with such movie-making, just by renting this wait a technician. It seems that there was an attempt to search for the script too, because, even if Tyrannus really does not act as a gladiator until the end, at least it speaks Latin .. <br /> All trashing aside, I actually enjoyed this movie a. Not as much as a movie puppet film, maybe, but full moon still delivers! The only thing that shame me was that there was no full moon at the end of the video!
