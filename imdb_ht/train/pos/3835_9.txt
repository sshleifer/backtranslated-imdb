This movie is amazing - it's just like a nightmare. The rare story, the dark dark, swarming insects everywhere, the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great! People who love cinema movies or very black exotic will find this fantastic. It looks a little bit of the films of David Lynch: the strange story, the dreams are scarce, the red curtains. Night Noire has almost no conspiracy. It's rather a succession of fascinating surrealists, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension and a fascinating devotion, I'd give it a 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the movie a 8. Night Noire is a movie worth seeing. Find out that DVD and you will be rewarded!
