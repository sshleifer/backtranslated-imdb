This film, though, acclaimed criticism, was of course not yet released in the US on DVD, as another great - Christine Lahti at "Housekeeping", from the same year. But if you can support the Region 4 (Australian) DVD, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available online as well. Davis is complemented by a great story, as well as memorable performance from his support, especially Claudia Carvan and late, great John Adele. Amazing, or maybe not, this movie and its stars have gone unacknowledged in time rewarding Academy, as did "Keep", but treating yourself to both of them - you'll be happy you've done!
