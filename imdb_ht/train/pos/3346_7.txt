In the Old West there are still people who live inhale violence and women who hold their breath. A famous jockeys named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) comes to hire citizens to rid the gunslingers (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), the Baronland hoodlums. There is her meadow (Emile Meyer), her daughter (Karen Sharpe), her companion (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of Saloon (Ted De Corsia). Clint as the law is called deputy to bring peace and put some cards saying the following: ¨ Warning, putting in arms or other urban weapons is prohibited. Check out all hardware at the Marshall Office. Clint found his former girlfriend, a local soldier (John Sterling) in charge of the Saloon Girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council scary raw methods carried out by Clint. At the end of the kingpin gardener looks and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. This is a very interesting story of a sheriff-for-hire who has only one more killing to go. It starts as a western-moving west but follows our surprise with black characters and solid drawings. The story is almost manure, a pacifier reaches a city just in time to ensure its citizens, but later events are getting worse. The highlights are the burning of saloon and climatic confrontation in the end. The phenomenon with great role for Robert Mitchum as Angel warns with bitter fighter, it shows at all. Livestock and lively music by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), atmospheric movies in black and white by Lee Garmes. The motion picture is amazingly accomplished by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, three in attic) that has made Western Wreath as ˝Invention of a gunfighter and ¨Zane Gray episodes. The dazzling results for this cut west.
