This film is a true and historical film. It is very helpful for people who do research on the LDS church because it is 100% true. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. <br /> It is very realistic, interesting, and motivational. Some people think it's not real, but it is. It is about restoring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the Prophet Joseph Smith, who has been restored. He had such events in his life as the illness that he had when he was a boy, courting him Emma Smith, his wife, Emma, ​​giving birth, and so on. But most importantly, it reveals the restoration of the Church.
