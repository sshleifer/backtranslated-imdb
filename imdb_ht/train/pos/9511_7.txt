A blood gang history that takes place in the years of Great Depression. He tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turned the other way: Mike fights to save his life and only remained his son, because the rest of his family died due to game halls of his own boss. He succeeded in his revenge and assured the honorable future to his son, but he died in the end. These stories have never been happy after all. Mike Salliwan's role was beautifully played by Tom Hanks, and Mr Rooney's party (Mafia boss) was born by Paul Newman. The movie makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "stolen bank". This movie is still worth watching although you might expect something bigger at Sam Mendes after her Indian beauty.
