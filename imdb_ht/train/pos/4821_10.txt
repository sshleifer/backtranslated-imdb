One of these very intense movies is that draws us so far away, it ends a lot soon! Than they left looking at the screen like, "The names were not!", Lol. Good performance all around! The act is wonderful and Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew he would provide a solid, convincing performance to capture Victoria's regularity, temperament, and vulnerability in the entire movie. Also, the output is exceptional in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable remark in a remarkable time of Britian's history said through a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until it governed as Queen, later married Prince Albert, passing the birth of the first to nine children. It has a well written and unparalleled scenario. Rupert Friends as ever so the patient and compassionate young Prince Albert struggled to win the attention of the Queen of Youth, sparing her love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), were refreshing to look. Just as fattened was the relationship between Victoria in her teens and her mother, who was angry at times, just like her mother and King William (who also her mother's niece). Acting and scenes were fascinating, very emotional. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and existing political situation in this era, and indeed, anyone who loves a compelling realistic romance story
