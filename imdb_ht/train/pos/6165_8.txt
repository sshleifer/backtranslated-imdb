Yes, some scheme are a bit difficult to follow, and Bill has a tendency to get violent, but it's actually an aggressive show, so I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very interesting and tense, and the act is fairly good, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I'll admit, I prefer the older episodes of the newer episodes, and it's a bit of a shame that the program is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00 . Still, why I love the Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end make the next unmatchable episode. It is true, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to get it too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
