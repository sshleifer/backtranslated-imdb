Yesterday, I went to the monthly Antique Floque market that came to town. I really have no interest in these things, but I went to thank God for friends who have such an interest. Look at hundreds of vendors, spend a lot of them quickly, and I spend someone selling VHS tapes and DVDs. Most of the films it was about DVD was rather recent; One of my oldest notions was 1940 Cary Grant-Irene Dunne co-starred MY FAVORITE. But the VHS tapes, by nature, were mostly older films. I could not resist buying SOMETHING since being sold in 3 cassettes for $ 10.00. What is a bargain, as Eddie Murphy said. I came across one movie that I heard about for years, but never ever saw: John Cassavettes to OPEN NIGHT (1977). Well, I certainly wanted to be a fan of Gena Rowlands, and I heard that this movie was one of his finest performances. It also has FACES (1968). I've seen this about 20 years ago, a time when I probably did not have enough life experience to appreciate it well. And I wanted to take advantage of the bargain, so I grabbed that one too. My other choice was CLAIRE'S KNEE (1970). <br /> <br /> When I got home, I decided to place aside the work I planned to do so I could look OPEN. I was totally enthralled by this film. It focuses on Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), a famous actress of stage and screen, who, during out-of-town forecasts, has personal and professional issues coming in terms with both his characters and the play's theme face aging. After one rehearsal, an avid fan and hound autograph calls her and weeping (and tears) to "I love you! I love you!" A few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. This begins Myrtle's descent in his head where he must face his own fears of aging, the future of his career as a mature actress, and the inability he finds in the play itself (written by a much older dramatist girl, played by Joan Blondell). Throughout the movie, she sees the girl dead, an obvious symbol of her past; drinks are almost always; and received support from his director (Ben Gazzara), the producer (Paul Stewart), his costume (John Cassavettes himself), and the dramatist. Actually, they are more concerned about how his behavior will affect them and their careers: flubbing lines on stage, impromptu new lines, generally cracked up on stage, and arriving to open Broadway totally drinking. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! As I watched the film, I was at times surprised, confused, amused, disparaging, but eventually participating, entertained, and satisfied. Cassavettes really had a great sense of humor, caring so much that their audience understood what he wanted, and he wanted to be emotionally involved in the story. He makes ALWAYS ALWAYS the use of fans of hunger theater, even the girl dressed in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by Anne Baxter at the start of film. This harsh functioning most obviously supports his aging theme, the contrast of women older and younger. He also obviously used the contrast as a symbol of Myrtle's confronting his own youth. At first, I felt the symbolism was too obvious, but then I realized that what the Cassavettes meant. He does not want audience to hear the misunderstanding of what he is getting; If they did, it would interfere with their emotional involvement. This spectator of young Myrtle traps, attacking him, wants to destroy him. Myrtle eventually "kills" him, but before he can really come to terms with himself and the play, he must come down (another face death?). So Cassavettes found her to drink that she could not walk and be pulled in her dressing room to read the open night on Broadway. He resurrects himself (helping yourself out of these situations is also important for the theme of the film) and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of playing for the better not to improvise so that it has some traits of hope for the aging character playing. These scenes are funny and interesting. Cassavettes and Rowlands actually played in front of live audiences, who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie. The play will also act as contrast: it's mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses, that is, until myrtle changes its denier. In doing so, it also improves the work of its co-stars. The natural evolution of interaction (realization of improvisation) between and among humans, realistic realism, and universal truths - these were Cassavettes' concerns in making films. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is amazing at all. Of course, he has great faces, and Cassavettes (notorious in love with it at all their wedding) treat us so much from it so we can feel his emotions and that we know what's going on inside of it. It makes you very care about this character that you want to see his work routine out of this crisis in the soul. And this is what keeps your attention for 2 hours and 30 minutes running time. The movie is deliberately rhythmic at times and requires constant attention, but anyone with a good film-making interest and great act will be rewarded. Another man said that this is a movie for those who love movies. Everyone else must beware. <br /> <br /> Find out new ones if you have never seen it. All of it is excellent, and it is one of the best Cassavettes movie.
