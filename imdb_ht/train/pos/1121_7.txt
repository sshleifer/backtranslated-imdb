Here's a real freebie for you. It starts out with another take-off on the PSYCHO show scene, on campus, then gets crazier when several cowods and boyfriends doy are head south for Break Spring. The problem begins when driving in Redneck County led by Homicide Sheriff Dean. One of the college cuties wanders into the woods, witnessing a murder by the sheriff and having himself blowing open. Then it allows-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as Dean foot, traps and slaughters witnesses are undoubtedly one by one. Tony mass is over-target as the evil, gofr-happy Dean. The general tone of the film is really disturbing. The finish is so abruptly you almost think the director runs out of film; It's also a study of despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists of the world.
