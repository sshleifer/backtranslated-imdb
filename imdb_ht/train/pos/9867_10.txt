I saw first ice age in the Subiaco cinema when it came out, back to '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I love it. It has some sort of heat. <br /> We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you look it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element that makes it different from all the other 3D animations made at the moment - The characters have no particular homes that are left. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting. <br /> <br /> Also, every individual character on the surface, appears to be just set up with each other, but they're really true friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). The South Sloth is good at annoying him, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth. Another great point on the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the settings and characters were originally modeled by clay, giving the film an artistic corner. <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of the movie is that sex means much. There are hardly any female characters, but you do not really realize that until after watching it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you see the movie. Due to this, there's also not mentioned in a nuclear family that would really be pathetic in an environment like the Ice Age. <br /> <br /> All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof of how many efforts have been put into 3D animation before Shrek 2 and the Incredibles come out.
