This film was twice seen on community tests and really liked it. I work at the Jane Finch community and feel the film really captures some of the sense and taste of the community - gravel, resilience, expression, creativity, your childhood and a dementia dose. The word, dialogue and solid act and I really find myself drawn to the story of Raya young woman while fighting to pursue her goals and not to lose her in the process. Huge dance dance and it is not just the body that moves smoothly with electricity but the camera moves with high liquidity and intelligence too. All the characters are multi-dimensional - There is no good or bad way with the women admirably strong. This is a movie that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irresistible spirit of teens, hip hop and community like Jane Finch.
