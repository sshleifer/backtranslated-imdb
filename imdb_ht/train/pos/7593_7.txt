The movie is absolutely funny. But did you expect a film-high intellectual frontman based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's act is not exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of fear that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it quite fun if you're just taking it to the surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eyes-candy and musicians who can play basketball at a real level of expertise. There's an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky complaining guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A Love Interest. It's formal but really, temporarily suspending disbelief. Come. This is called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you've signed up for? Make yourself a favor if you look at it - I found myself a copy of some Engrish subtitles that made the movie preconceived unintelligible conversation, but we got a big laugh out of it. They would seem to be very staring at Jerusalem with the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, shouting, I was thrown. I would watch it again. <br /> Especially for that scene battle in the bar. Well choreography and good shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - I would like to play on one of the people. <br /> <br /> Slick enough for me, but I searched on movies.
