I know it's fashionable now hating this movie. I saw hundreds of spook films as her original 1963 haunted as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not silent and it does not hold anything that probably is why modern viewers seemed to love it. But many viewers can accept from movie control such as cry because knees are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film has many great scenes and special effects and great ones were great. I've seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of exciting and stylish films and did not try for the kind of realism in the 6th sense. The haunting goes away and is certainly not boring. Maybe this movie might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more to a traditional plot structure. The former haunt was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also the Innocents and Legends of Hell House and Pamela Franklin.
