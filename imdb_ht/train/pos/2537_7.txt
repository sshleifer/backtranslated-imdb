Boris and Bela do well together in this movie, whether they are against each other, or planting the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and just bought it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children, I took note of the following 2 things: It was keeping the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I keep a few things I did not when I first looked at it. Quick story with an unpredictable end. A must for film manure !!!
