Forget the depth of meaning, leaving your logic to the door, and have a great time with this funny mournful, totally absurdist, ultra-standing live-action "cartoon." Music MEN is a throw-up of every superhero movie you've ever seen, but it's easy to super-wannabes are so interesting, varied, and well driven that they're memorable characters of their own right. Dark humor, outright silliness, good action action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this funny fantasy of lovable perverts a true winner. The comedian talents of the actors playing Mystery Men - including One Woman Wife - is a perfect foil for Wes Studi as that can only be described as a Yoda-basement, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off- a-mi (and bizarre good) bandits ever to walk through the pages of a black horse book and on the big screen. Take ready to laugh, cheer, and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
