I thought the film was fairly well done for a movie movie, and it had both lots of action and humor. I found the value of entertainment worth watching, and would look it again or a similar show again. I was disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> I can see a possibility of a set of action based on this concept or end and Sean once again playing for even higher "cash" types of stakes since her life should be on the line again anyway. <br /> I felt that Sean played the role very well, and reminded me of an actor by the name of Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on the day of our lives - the soap opera.
