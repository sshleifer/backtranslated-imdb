I saw this movie First Friday (1/19) night at Park City for Sundance and it was immensely moved. Sitting in a theater and listening to the first but the worst soldiers went by was almost over I could carry. Others at the audience were also moved and while we were trying to turn away, the youngest we could have brought witnesses as these guys and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze, and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film, were present. While they can be home right now, you can say this war is still inside and probably still will be. Whether you support the war or not, it's your duty to support troops and something else than an exceptional file. See this movie!
