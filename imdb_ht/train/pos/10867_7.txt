I spotted in this film list guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this movie was in screening. Basically, there is a election for the new president of the Hong Kong Triad High Society, so you can imagine how many violence will happen this time. The limit is between "Lokomotiv" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for control of the most ancient and powerful corporations of the corporation. Also begins Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So Lam Suet as Big Head and Tung Ka Tung as Kun. There are some realistic corruption terms and moments, just about enough action, apart from maybe when the cops participate, but a sequel to follow, so it's a very refreshing crime drama crime. Really good!
