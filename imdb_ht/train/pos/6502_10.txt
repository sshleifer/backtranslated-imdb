Although too young to remember the first show of the series (being just a baby) I later kept repeating it on TV at the end of the 80, just when I was getting interested in the war with all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interest, related tales in his time at the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and see many TV series over the Second World War, with mixed views. The British television stations are generally very good in these products, as the World of War can be quite well attested, and many gems are performed by both BBC and independent companies. I recommend the titles as "The Nazis - A Warning to History," "Blitz" and the BBC series on Dunkirk. "Britain in war in color", with its companion "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are in a very high standard. The world of war is by far the best, and, despite its age, never neglected to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war that will hold up crops that are obviously not included in the series and of course Second World War took place on such a large fabric that they produced a set and every detail would take more time and money Then, any other, though such an undertaking was even possible. What I feel must tell the person who decides that it does not include everything is that the world of war can not physically do this as a set but it sure as he can do you more research - and make it enjoyable. That certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommended for anyone with a past interest. The series was so good that it would be hard to disagree that it is very programmable and very informative.
