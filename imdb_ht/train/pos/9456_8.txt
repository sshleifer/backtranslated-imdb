Unlike many other films, the disturbance is neither absolute in the unpleasant naked (Man Bite Dog) or Absolute Violence (most Peckinpah movie), its rescue shock by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is very simple in its unpleasant, but the film's effects derive further from its slow build-up and sense of insulation surrounding the four drive, both before and after everything starts to go wrong . This time when the cannons pass under the child on the bridge, who did not even recognize the men he had earlier played music and, let alone show any signs of human affection towards them, is among the most disasters of modern films . The tension increases steadily throughout the boat's voyage, and endorses even after the final credit - the completion of the meaning of the characters' heroic characters. The film plausibility is greatly acclaimed by playing in their drive, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctantly respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, was never better. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to the 'Banjo Territory' - perhaps only Carter's findings as an effective wick-work on a region's tourism industry. I can only think of a handful of movies that put me in such a severe depression after being finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although many of it is excellent in itself, salvation is a classic above all because there is no adequate point in comparison to it - it is unique.
