From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is perhaps boring I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> Each element came together in this movie very well. It's not often you see a movie with many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast delivers every joke raunchy sensationally. Carell remains sweet in the movie everywhere at the end of the film you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. Thrust in support is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> One of the things on this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we provide. This is what makes an easy movie to remember tenderly. This movie will often bring when the words "waxing chest" and "condoms" are mentioned in conversation. <br /> <br /> Look at it in the theater I was surprised how many seniors were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women enter Despite an older audience, this movie has always filled the entire theater and laughs .. I think the kind of people who will love this is the fans in Office and Steve Carell. A lot of jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you'd see on Family Guy, too. This film is enough for teenagers and is always sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are in the movie, just remember this movie is full of good humor. The jokes are not "gay jokes," they're just jokes. And they're funny.
