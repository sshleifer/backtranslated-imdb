This movie definitely gets a thumb in my hand. It's a witty joke and even in occasional stereotypes and descriptions of Eastern European has made me the point of most of the movie. It draws is intelligent and 100% original and will have you guessing through the entire movie. One person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. It's plain and simple to see that it has taken a leap of faith stepped out of the genuine 'chick-flick' genre. Its accent is excellent and its performance has been amazingly surprised and well executed. It's the best performance I've ever seen in Hilary, and I've seen most of its films. His character, Yonica Babyyeah described as 'Britney Spears in Eastern Europe' and this is seen in some of its styling and the song, 'I want to blow you ... ... ... up'. You also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack laughed at the film and sometimes his slapstick humor, but also his facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle at all. I recommend this movie.
