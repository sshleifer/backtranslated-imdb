If you are researching UFO facts, then this video is very important. The 'Meat' in the video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. It is without a doubt from the best of America. Form to be objective, honest and realistic of its report. Many astronauts from America throughout the era have reported some kind of contact, or UFO observance and have videos of some of these missions. At least in something smaller than that requires more purposeful investigation. I think this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like any video documentation supposed, this one can be slanted, but it includes more information and views from a hero to accomplish American. People do not come together every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in details should not omit you from watching this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend you look with an open mind.
