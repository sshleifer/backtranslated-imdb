It's not so good about developing characters or seamless situations, though. When you see it, you get the feeling that you were chasing them out and coming out of the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching it all the time.

Jennifer Connelly is the very heartthrob, I know, but I still love the Miss more darkness. The youngsters get most of the time screen without a lot of intrusion from these room up-ups. Is it just me or did most of the young men look a lot awful looks like?
