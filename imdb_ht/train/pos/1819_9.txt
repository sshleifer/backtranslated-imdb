When I first looked at this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and looked at it about 3 times. We just looked at her again and I loved her more than I did last time I would watch her !! :) :() <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie, which I love. Scratch is his sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (PA) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, it is the beginning of an amazing adventure. The five main reasons why I am absolutely crazy about this movie: One: I like the characters (except Carface). My favorite three are Charlie, scratched and a girl named Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I like the period of history in which this film is set. It is set during the ban in the United States. Three: The Bluto Don (as usual) is superb. Fundamentals are good too. Card: There is a strange excitement in this movie that holds me on the edge of my place. Five: the songs of this is beautiful. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, push, thrill" ... So watch this movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
