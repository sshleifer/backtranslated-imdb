Well, I finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I, I'll probably first see this new documentary this summer The "Patti Smith: Dreams of Life" sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel that a bit dated, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and awesome moments. He tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and the fight that he and his fellow students at Vince Lombardi have high wages against their new principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Films Movies," quite exactly describes Mari Woronov in performance as a "Ev Evden Evil.") A typical teenager. History Stabilization History is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (these mouse explodes, the giant mouse, Hansel and Gretel room monitors) and some tunes rousing tunes. Reef is, of course, the # 1 fan of Ramones's original Punk band, and band's dancers from a dozen bakers from his greatest song during the course of the film, including five at a concert which is a total explosion . Indeed, to see Rif fury dancing at "Teen Lobotomy" in this blowout may be funniest moments in the picture. With the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky at Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street song "I just want to have something to do," is quite exhilarating. The movie ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every wet wet wet wet wet. Fun stuff really. On a side note, the Ramones were one of the strongest band I've ever seen in the concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this movie came with English subtitles to hear there are problems. How many penalties were found to be those subtitles needed, I ask ....
