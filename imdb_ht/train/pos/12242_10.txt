I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o'clock 5 times to see it, so to realize what a great movie it was. First, he describes a figure in WW2 that we do not know in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and Nazi governments show more "humankind". One of the realities that impressed me was the most mentioned, at the end of the movie, in a murder that took place in a forest of the last 20 years ... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place : These are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another sign for those who loves the details is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they walk on a door, or an open door. Many doors are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, acts, etc. anytime that happens. Did you notice that?
