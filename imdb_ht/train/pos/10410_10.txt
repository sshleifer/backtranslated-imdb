Thug Baghdad is one of my ten ever-present movies. It is interesting without gore, it is very well-filmed and the art direction is impeccable. The casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram has made me believe in engineering. And the evil example is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. It puts the bar very high. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and never immerse it. This movie is an adventure for all ages .. no one is too enjoying it. Thieves in Bahgdad jog my memory at a most innocent time ... I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the US was just about to enter the WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he could continue to hide "wrong" a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda associates up, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in the "Four Feathers" .... great movie-making!
