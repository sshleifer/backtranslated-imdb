As a pagan, I must say that this movie has little if any magickal meaning. It is a "fun" movie magic and does not mean to teach us anything except that love is the most magical of all, and never used it in a controlled or vengeful way. This is a lesson everyone needs to learn, not just pagans. That said, this movie is beautifully written and gently executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. Hermione Gingold delivers a stellar performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with many film credits to mention except as Miss Marble's wife "Kill by Death") was wonderful as Mrs. Novak, who has no self-advocate, which can not warn Queenie up. Also start Jack Lemmon (wonderful performance) and Jim Kov√°cs (brilliant witty) .. "Witches can not cry." Why, they can not shed a salt water because their hearts are full of magic. . <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and his brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) is witch cuff. Cloaked deeply into the mysterious secrets of those in Craft, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without much as causing a raised eyebrows. But then, together comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a firm, no-story, dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to his old college Gillian rival. <br /> <br /> Not a lack of original luck, he finds himself moving to Gillian's building and is immediately "abstrusen" by his charm and grace. By using Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (the familiar Gillian, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian begins to work on this wonderful new man to get back to his old enemy. /> But Magick should never use to control or hurt, and Gillian learns that the road is difficult in the most ambitious manner. Not only does he have to face what he did, but he has to face Shep in his guilt. <br /> <br /> From the critical perspective; However, the film took a serious turn: the very date effects of the point were the best camps. Some of the seemingly injected shot in the basement of a man's house, but at least the characters were original and fun. On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Great chat! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a Note to Trivia, this is the root of the dear sitcom sitcom. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the characters of the present and accounted for. You have the hands to look and see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites, and I watch it often. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
