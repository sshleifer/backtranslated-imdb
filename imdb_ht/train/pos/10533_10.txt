I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I did not laugh much when watching a movie! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! This movie can not appeal to some people (I can not really say why without it!), But each of their own! I liked it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction R is huge and some of the very smart shots. It seems that if they might have had a lot of fun when filming it! Although there are really only two main characters in the movie and not a lot of awful actors they manage to pull it off and make the movie enjoyable to watch.
