<br /> I take issue with the other review comment for the simple reason that this is a mysterious film, not a supernatural one! It is not the only movie to have a "supernatural" explanation ("vampire"), but turns out to be a very good MONDAN. Other movies that come to mind are Edgar Wallace's "Before Dawn" and (the famous) "Mark of the Vampire". The movie does a WONDERFUL work to create a very "spooky atmosphere", as DRACULA, when Renfield meets the count on the stairs of his castle, or in the vampire brand, when the two people look until the windows of crush They cast castles and see a "corpse" play an organs, while Luna goes downwards using wings! VERY CLEAN! <br /> If someone likes these (often silent) atmospheric touches, this movie is a MUST! <br /> <br /> Norm bird
