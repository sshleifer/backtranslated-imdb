I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex but it does not take away in the entertainment. He chuck full of comedy moments and has a very attractive quality. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each has its own original style that adds to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Laws leaps into your mind. Superb act was made by all, particularly Brenda Blythen. He and Craig Ferguson were great at pulling in some of the funnier moments. If you are looking for a good comedy I would definitely recommend this movie!
