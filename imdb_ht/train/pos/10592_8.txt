Pleasant history in the community at Pimlico in London which, following a WW2 explosion bomb explosion, found a Royal Constitution stating that the area they live in as part of burgundy. This film works because it appeals to fantasy a lot of we have about making up our own rules and have not listened to them. A solid cast in British stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, makes this more credible. There are some very nice moments in the movie, as when people have run out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade to start feeding and stuffing on them. Even if you still know Pimlico would become part of the UK again, the people of PImlico and as a result of the viewer does not mind when this happens, leave a nice feeling of joy. <br /> It's amazing to think that these budget low movies from a small studio in London still remain so popular about fifty years later. Producers must have a good thing.
