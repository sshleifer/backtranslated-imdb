Sanchez room is extreme, British version of Jackass in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go to great lengths and humiliate each other. The purpose of this show is better than Jackass is because most of the cascades are not planned to make the reaction more funny. There are 3 series of shows, the first to follow them around and take a long look at their example life. There is an episode about their love life, work etc. The second series sends the boys to try out different occupations. The third followed European trips. It seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses in the series. In my opinion the third set is the best, but trust me when I say, if you have a stomach in the abdomen, do not rave, as you are lightly seen a fair amount of blood and puke in each episode.
