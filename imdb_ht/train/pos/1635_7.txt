Back on my high school day in Salina Kansas, they filmed something called "Brave Young Men in Weinberg" locally, and their movie team was rather important for weeks. Eventually, we learned that the film was "up the Academy", and it was a bit umm, "lower front" that we led to believe. <br /> I saw it, since I was there, and local audiences seemed less than happy at the show. I was 17, and thought it was a rather versatile attempt at a home-comedy home post, right down to the fart jokes. <br /> <br /> Look at it many times since, and I was mellowed to a bit. It's dumb, but at times it catches a bit of humor in the "crazy" magazine, at least as well as most "angry TVs". Ron Liebman would hate her, but she is almost perfect, and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moments were a short scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I parked my car, while I bought some guitar strings. Too bad my Pinto appearance, usually seems to get off for TV. Did not see the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they had a sale.
