A melodrama that blocks typical of its period (mid-1950s) and proper matrices. Rock Hudson, everyone in mountainous still falls in love with, playing his usual role, but whereas in Giant, did the same year, when his material and co stars (Taylor & Dean) were higher than Average, in this film it is just not good enough to raise the caliber beyond a bad story of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. Solo-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, reeling his way into the movie in a slut stupor, and Dorothy Malone, playing a poor vampire little girl totally over the head) finishing the losers with Hudson becoming Bacall - who is instead of wood in this part that does not have enough character or understands to get it going. Paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the end of the happily happening with the ill, is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested in that the movie was based on a true story that made the draw. Like other films in the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the movie could remade: Stack's character would be tightening if he hides homosexual feelings for Mitch not to marry. Todd Haynes is far in the sky greatly improving on everything in heaven enabled, also directed by scythe. Maybe Haynes might have noticed writing on the wind and giving us a really memorable movie.
