I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of William Castle, so this was definitely a must-see for me. This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was a underrated director. True, he has made some cheap movie horror movie schlocky, but he added something to the movie: real live GIMMIX theater that you do not see again. For example, having a nurse in the case of someone had a heart attack in his cinema and placed vibrator in the seat of the TINGLER. This is really a well-documented documentary and brings this rather bold director of light, and celebrates its contribution to horror movies. He also painted Castle as a larger than life character, who was very well loved and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentary films that mainly show additions from film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows mainly interviews with his family and directors who have been influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante. A must see for classic fans and sci-fi.
