Show this probably will not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; he does not require permission and does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, dinosaur robots, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stolen cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, it is a spoil, the biggest perversion. If you can not appreciate the offbeat humor offered, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. She brings together the comedy genre of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (Comedy Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait 'Remain') and the creative energy of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Vision Heat & Jack , monster house). He also presented the best talents in the community developed online, channel101.com. (If you are in this show, keep an eye out for "Acceptable Media Department" on vh1 this March, it will be drawn from the same talent pool.) <br /> See Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
