This movie was excellent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one however got all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger factory and 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mopar's mother knew how to build the best muscle car! I was in the Sky Chrysler every time Kowalski floors that hemi big blocks, and it sure did so much :)
