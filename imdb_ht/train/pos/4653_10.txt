This is a commercial movie rip dazzling comedy with one that I could look over and over again without growing tired. Peter Ustinov has never been in a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his circle of understanding, but very smart master plan. Karl Malden has always been my admirer since he starred in 'Streets of San Francisco'. I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie though, appearing to be so inept in everything she tries to do, but in truth so switching on, particularly to the end when he informs everyone that he has invested much money that she also discovered whitewashed her clothes. One thing concerned me though, could somebody please tell me why I can not buy this on DVD or VHS format in the UK, could somebody please help?
