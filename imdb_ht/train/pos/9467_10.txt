I was drawn to DAN in real life from the excellent comments and the thirst for a drama that was well written-thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell star in the movie, you know an audience that will get like in LISS MISS SUNSHINE, a very fun and rewarding performance. DAN in real life has delivered this promise. The movie is so real of many world wide families that have lost a member and again went on with their lives in search of something that will give them back to magic before their loss. With Steve Carell and the beautiful Juliette Bellache, their relationship was so well done and written that the scenes were so real to their characters and their journey. Throw, along with stories made DAN in real life to remember as we head to the front holidays.
