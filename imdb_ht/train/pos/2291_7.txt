Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Rabbit Beast" are that the wacky Leporid featured in "A Hare Wild" now has a name, and that he's famous for her "Of course you realize this means war ! " for the first time. Mostly, the Territory Territory crowd has always tried to figure out what exactly to do with this long-ear cornea. It's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest. <br /> But do not make any mistakes, it's quite hilarious that Bugs Bunny makes the gullible eternally Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things come up very well throughout the drawing. I recommend it.
