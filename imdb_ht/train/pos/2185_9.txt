Poor Basil Rathbone, an euthanist composer who lost his muse. He was faking it for some time, buying his lyrics and music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin word) come to meet and fall in love. Then they discover what they've done. Complications cause, but all right to the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing terrifically. Mary signed a Paramount deal and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby Music Hall's Kreyol Hall Hall. For reasons I do not understand, movie audiences did not take it, so he returned to Broadway and made one Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he plays comedy doing it very well. Her month is still deflated by Sidekick Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they did not make more films together. As in most of the Paramount Crosby, there is no large number of outputs, but I agree with the previous review of the title tune made as a junk confrontation session at a pawn shop. Good work not all. <br /> A surprisingly original plot with great entertainment.
