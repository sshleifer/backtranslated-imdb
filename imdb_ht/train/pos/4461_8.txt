I really liked this movie. I've seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it higher than his famous American in Paris. Sometimes it looks like the lost story of Gene Kelly movie in the wonderful dance and song number, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.
