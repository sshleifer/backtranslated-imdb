You have never seen anything like it. Once the coup begins, it is even brighter, believers-of-your-seat thriller you'll ever see - even if you know the result. And it's all real, because it's a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> At the moment it was over, it was on my top 10 list of all great time movies. <br /> <br /> Beloved slobbering fans of the right wing. Everyone I know who has seen this movie gives it the 4-star rating. Even if you do not care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you will find yourself nervous-racked and - believe it - on the edge of your seat. <br /> It's a roller-coaster roller.
