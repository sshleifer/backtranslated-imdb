Here is a decent middle-70 file on a gates in New York City that just happens to be an old brownstone. Looks like there's lots of gates around, but of course this unwitting model happens to it needs some space from his boyfriend / fiance and so it's just going to pick one, which is disguised as an apartment beautiful and reasonable prices. She meets many strange neighbors, and even goes to a birthday party for a cat. Upon meeting with realtor because he heard strange noise at night from the top, he found that he and an old priest SIPPO were to be the only tenants. Whoa! Then what are these bizar things? His companion (a thin lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins poking around and finds that things do not look like that, not a long shot. This has some decent scenes creepy with the idea of ​​the old criticisms that its "sometimes" neighbors have been other than their appearing is fairly intriguing. A bit of decent pods and even a parade of less-than-norm folks towards the end makes this a decent look, and while I've seen this many times on the TV version of DVDs better, of course. Not a bad little terrible movie, maybe a good companion piece of "burning offerings". 8 out of 10.
