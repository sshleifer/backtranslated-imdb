Even though I did not start reading the "Classics" in literature until I was 47, it was never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, especially because no part of the book I loved less, only part I enjoyed more. 1983 TV mini-series and Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton were everything I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full movie movie in 2006. The Dalton 'Mr. Rochester' was very good but I loved Zelah 'Jane Eyre'. Recreating on another 'classic' movie I've seen recently, I was disappointed in production, direction and dialogue. He was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance in Hollywood. Artistic licenses in the great works of literature are nothing short of plagiarism. Use the title after this license is fraud. Leave it to the Brits to find this right one (among others). You can not search the book without restricting the movie with proper contexts and minds. Well done BBC.
