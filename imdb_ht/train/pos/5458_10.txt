I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought that the plot of the film was realistic and related to any period in the American history. There is still such a woman doing what she needs to do to raise the class system. I feel that the character of Lilly was described correctly and could not have done better. What I liked so much was when she realized what she really loved. Throughout the film all those who fell for her were in love with her, gave her everything, even losing her career. Until he met Cortland, he did not understand why the guys were giving everything for happiness. The way life ended was far beyond expectations. I would recommend this movie to anyone in a mature audience so you can understand the content and the bottom-laying meaning of the movie and conspiracy.
