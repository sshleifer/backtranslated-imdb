This is a very light-led comedy about a wonderful family that has a child named Pecker because he used Peck to feed him. Pecker likes to take all sorts of pictures of people in a small neighborhood of Baltimore, MD, and managed to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from New York City. Pecker has a nice sister who goes simply black on SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoons of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of those who show off the bumps of the jets and grinding mills and gals to make pretty much the same. It is rather hard to keep yourself from the gutter and this movie, but with concern, it is only a movie that gives you a few laughs in a simple picture made in 1998.
