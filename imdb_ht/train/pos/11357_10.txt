"Citizen X" is the story very well said in the hunt for one of the worst serious storytellers. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place; Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Builder Spartanski (Viktor Spiraz) plays a major legal investigator for Rostov oblast militia. It finds recent and present decades unauthorized, apparently not even people. The mortars are suspended because no one has ever taken the issue properly to investigate the evidence. It drives for finding and stopping the killer. His only tool is his dedication, skill and honesty. Its objects are corruption and political ideology in the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. May be naive it has led to failure to have it not for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically crafty cynical who understands the game and knows how to cope with the Soviet Union's bureaucrats. However, he also shares Burrakov 's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even though the official party line is "There is no bloody killer in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The throw is exceptional. These places and beds are perfect recreation in the Soviet day. Randy Edelman is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this movie shows a criminal and disturbing phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy. This was a made-to-be-filmed film by HBO Films and they became a great resource for films that could never have occurred.
