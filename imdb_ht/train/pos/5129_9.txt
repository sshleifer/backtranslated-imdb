I can see why this movie was Oscar-nominated for Best Live Short Action, as it was designed to master. Even if you do not particularly like the blues (though I, this sounding more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It is simply very well done, though for the life of me, I can not see why director Gjon Mili only got to direct one movie - this one. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director did not find any sort of career enhancement. As for black performers, I could understand that does not cause the careers of change in high gear, as unfortunately most of white corporations have indifference (or worse) to black or "the type of music". If you watch this movie, if you do not particularly enjoy the earliest portion, jump ahead on the 5:50 mark - where it's chosen remarkably. When the lady stopped singing and performers began to impress, the pace improved quite a bit.
