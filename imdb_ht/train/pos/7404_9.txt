Just see the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The programs said it was - A perfect fun - made, touching, fun, dramatic and meaningful meaning. I could not agree more. I just hope the rest of the movie films come to this standard of entertainment, and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films planned to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
