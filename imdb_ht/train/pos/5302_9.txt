This movie keeps me entertained. In comparing this to serious mothers, Mr. Waters went back to his grittier side. This is not nearly as polished. <br /> There is a black side here. A message about how success and fame changed someone - but most importantly how it changed people around you. <br /> <br /> There is not a fake moment in this movie. The characters are a bit cartoonish ... but I want to believe that Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> It is fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... This is really the finest it works.
