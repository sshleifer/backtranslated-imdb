I think this is what this movie wants you to say at the end of the movie! or Australian Dads? I still do not know, but what I know is that I really liked this movie but that could not be my favorite movie! Big story with big actors but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say 'Oh, it's so good' ... Still, who did it? What has happened? Who's that guy? No answer to these questions ... <br /> Mysterious film and a good brand in general ... I give it an 8/10, go on the 8.5!
