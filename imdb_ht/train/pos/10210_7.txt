This is not exactly a big movie, but I admire the writers and directors to try something a little different. The film's main film is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can change much the future. In some ways this reminds me of the sloping slide film, though instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly and each helping to build into the beautiful conclusion. Plus, an odd dog guy seems to understand all this and talks about this during one short scene - as it is some sort of the powerful but there's absolutely no explanation about it in the movie (like two guys are fighting each other in tower clock at the Hudsucky PROXY). Jacket DVD shows just Audrey Tautou. This is capitalizing on its success at AMELIE, though it is only one of many actors in the movie and there is no single starting role. The speed is animated, good acting and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not score it is higher is that some of the characters were a bit refreshing and I think the movie could possibly be tightened up with a few less subplots.
