I was not sure at first if I was watching a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. I guess giving time to production was a mix of all three. Adultly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you've got a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on. We were able to witness what seemed to be realistic and equipment training regimes. Where this movie came together so I was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I see it) that I have not encountered before. You can put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of the young fighters. This was mixed in with the usual issues to show offensive Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think Japanese actor actors would be a bit scarce. The film is excellent as a state source in the American mind in 1943 as the war with Japan. Also of interest was a digging of the Japanese related to the help USA has given Japan over the past years.
