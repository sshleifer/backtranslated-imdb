Stoic and Lakonic Soldier Todd (a good performer and credible Kurt Russell's timeless performance) was cast on a remote desert planet after judging obsolete by the wicked and arrogant Colonel Mekum (succinctly played in the Hild Thin by Jason Isaacs) , who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced crossroads of genetically engineered fighters. Todd meets a ragtag peace community in self-reliance depravity and has defended this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working in a clever and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, paints a refreshing vision of a weak, cold, and harsh environment near the future while maintaining a fast speed and a tough, fearless tone of all. In addition, Anderson touches the momentum of humanity (Todd's struggle to get in touch with her already repressed feelings is truly impressive) and step-by-step acting scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell provides a strong and impressive painting that almost mimics Todd; It translates a lot of emotions without saying so much and instead makes the majority of his acts in his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supported by Jason Scott Lee as brutal soldiers rival Caine 607, Connie Nielson as Sandra Compassion, Sean Pertwee as Mace's Fresh, Jared and Taylor Thorne as Nathan's Little Mommy, Gary Busey as Crusty Seasoned Captain Church Veterans, Michael Chiklis as Pig Johnny Jolly, and Brenda Wehle as Mayor Hawkins's tender. Better yet, this movie made a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a relentless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength on physical strength. David Tattersall's polished community, Joel McNeely's vibrant full-leaf orchestral score, and the first-rate percentage rates all more enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction / hybrid field trips.
