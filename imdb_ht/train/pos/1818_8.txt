I saw this film when I was about 8-year-old and I loved it but it was not until I looked at it again at the age of 13 that I really understood it for what it is; a cartoon about a criminal dog and a real heart of gold "adopted" a girl in order to exploit her for her talent to talk to the animals. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, was murdered by his formal business partner, Carface, (who is absolutely diabolical in the way). His soul goes to where else but the heaven only finds a golden look that is really time his life, which Charlie, was the sneaky, but lovable case that he is stealing and rewinds, returning him to Earth . Once back on Earth, Charlie goes on seeking revenge on the wrong Carface. This is how it comes about young Anne-Marie, lonely little kid who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to cheat for his talent in order to return to his enemy careers. But Charlie's Charlie actually comes to care for young Anne-Marie and plans him just as he must make her mind to do what's right after Anne-Marie discovers what her "best friend" was Charlie really was using It makes money for a new and best dog casino. Now he must save him from the daunting carface. I still love this movie at the age of 22. The idea and scheme are really quite different and original from those of many other animated films. I especially love the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once. Carface was even better than he was in all the dogs going to the end of the sky. In this picture she appeared quite dubious in her role in Witch.
