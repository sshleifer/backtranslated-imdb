This is a great "small" movie. I say "small" because it does not have a gun without shooting or a dozen explosions, as in a movie John Woo. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to be the most likely and small production day. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a wire than a washing machine - instead of everything going around and around, it seems as if things just get worse as the epic conspiracy. Wonderful finish, very positive. I never read the book Leon Leonard, but it can not be much different from the movie because it feels like I'm watching a movie Elmore Leonard.
