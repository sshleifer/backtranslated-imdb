It was only when I saw Napoleon dynamite that I got to see Cracker Bag. Just nice feelings and yet never stooping were soppy. Some awesome movies and the lead girl are quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. She had a real heart at it. It is Achilles wounds in children who are exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when doing well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I am for one, I am looking for his next project. The tracking is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /> I just hope his next movie is not a lame thing like a shark movie. Cheers at all. Enjoy your movies.
