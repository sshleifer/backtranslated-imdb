I saw it at Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that one level of fun during this film will largely be based on one level of acceptance in Joseph's story. <br /> However, the side was very well done, well acted, a nice note. If you arrive at Salt Lake City, it is a must see it in the Legacy Theater. I've never been in a nicer theater as far as quality photos, sounds and ambitions in my whole life ... I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman start to have! For me that I am LDS and consider Joseph as a prophet, I have been touched in several places and brought in tears quite a few times ... which I supposed to have hoped to release out tissue before the movie began! Anyway, I said that this film is available at several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because if you believe Joseph Smith or not, it tells a fascinating story.
