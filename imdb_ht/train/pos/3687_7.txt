Greet again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 July seemingly associate about love in the city of light. A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust as a viewer. We are so familiar to character development on a 2-hour movie, it is a bit disarmed for this to happen in a 8 minute segment. The idea is 18 love / story relationships in 18 different neighborhoods of this beautiful city. Of course, some are better than others and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors, including: Coen brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many have been accustomed to appear as well: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, William Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. One of the best segments involves a mimic, and then another mimic and Nerdy, yet happy son of the two Mimo. Also play important roles are a dress, red, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, a child's death and many other subjects. Not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. Diversity in the segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie, it can not be great. Always read very much with a nice change in speed for the movie visitor often.
