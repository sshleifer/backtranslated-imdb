Engaging, history captures captured US military envelopes that have proven its innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ryker dodged fire friendly in a seemingly convict attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. In the classic court court vein, "Sergeant Ryker" is a very well-fabricated mystery, skillful guided by an outstanding cast, regular regular Kulik, and effective twist and turn conspiracy. This film was originally made as a TV movie in 1964, and immediately beefed up for this review and the presence of many "no" actors, and some action sequences. Dillman, repeating his role, is the seat-off as Defense Advocate, whose attention is sometimes lost in the personal behavior of the supportive Ryker, but somewhat far away wife, played with aplomb by Vera Miles. Rounding out the line is Peter Graves for the Prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key role to support. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of the character Ryker Paul is a balanced diagram of a simple but dedicated person who normally puts backe mindset that is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he puts. Marvin switches perfectly from indifference demand, in passionate determination, give a convincing, often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale dramatic. It's the performance that should elevate the movie into a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever list of drama courts. <br /> However, despite its apparent obscurity, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains a compelling and accurate companion, like a book that you just can not put down. Very recommended.
