I enjoyed this movie, and after watching it, he asked me just how many 'Caitlin Rose' existed in the world. Many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse, and torment by peers class and they were too scared to open their mouths on him? Just how threats and cruel teenagers can be towards each other, because as this film demonstrates, who is right is not the first, he who is popular, and afraid to manipulate the minds of the youth, and to influence to allow this sort of immorality to happen .Tiffani Amber Thiessen provides a powerful performance such as victims of rape, and Brian Austin Green is convinced as the guy torn between the girl he thought he liked, with his best friend .This is the kind of movie that does not get the exposure it deserves.Remarkable, and brighter, too good to be just a movie made for TV.
