*** SPOILERS *** <br /> This movie always looks pretty bothered until I remember that my college campus had an old-student-turned-nazi-racist-killer-that-then-comet- Suicide, also: his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> watch it up in the wikipedia- I added a few pictures of the items on it. <br /> It's hard to believe this thing really happened. <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Cube Ice, but Larry Fishburne, Kris Swanson, Jennifer Connelly & Mike Rappaport were good.
