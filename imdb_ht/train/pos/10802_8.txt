I'm on the opposite side of the previous comment. <br /> First of all, I do not think this was designed to be a straightforward end to the "Jerk". I mean, it's not the title "Jerk 2" ... it's the "Jerk, too", which leads me to believe that while a lot of names are the characters are the same, it actually revolves around someone completely different. /> <br /> Think about it: Virtually no connection to the movie before, other than character names; a totally different story; different cast; and the fact that it's partial music. <br /> I say that this movie some credit. He does have a lot to laugh at Mark Blankfield in his prime.
