The film shocked me. Personally I had Buddhism mostly bad buzz. Well finally after jetting the DVD for months now, I pooped it off on a sleepless night. even though the movie dragged the extra foot was used with the gravity aim of his passion and his recovery in addition to the game would be less realistic if they left out any scene. The best thing about the film is its consistency with the relationship. There was no ancient popping up or character threatening the relationship. I mean we usually see the girl meet boys by some amazing twist of fate, to date, something we've seen coming to break up and then to get back together in the past five minutes in the movie. but this film did not follow the mold. We actually experienced the relationship with it's flaws and even though the characters had the anti-love moment they did not have the dramatic positive they had to go, doing a montage every 15 and then meeting in love again. I did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. The story was unique and truthful in the way that I felt the people in the movie was the most credible that I saw in a romance movie from modern times. And it did not hurt all the baseball games was real and being in the real world series for fate chase in a little too. She does not have "Lady fair" but she is a fearless and honest film. I'll just say I love it.
