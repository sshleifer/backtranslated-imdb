Looking at the Rhine is one of the best anti-nazi propaganda films during World War II. Paul Lukas was certainly worthy of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brighter like the great actress and beauty she has. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in this era, and, of course, the fabulous films in the end, great, Mrs. Bette Davis.
