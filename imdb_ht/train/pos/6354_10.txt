Jim Carrey can do nothing. I thought this was going to be some mute childhood films, and it totally did not. It was so incredible for everyone, adults and children. I've seen it once caused it was almost out of theater, and now it's finally coming out on DVD this Tuesday and I'm excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you have not already, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
