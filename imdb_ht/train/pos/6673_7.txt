A lot of the user reviews I've seen on the IMDB for this movie does not really do it justice. First of all, let me just say that this film should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, which does not require one thought, only to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention to see a masterpiece of either movies or humor, then you will be sorely disappointed. But if you just want to watch a movie with some talented actors / actresses, and some good hit-phrases, then you'll enjoy it.
