I watch this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on the TV. I love when I discover movies like this, little, tender story about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, "The Man of the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, and the love of innocence and his love and justice. It's really a lovely, moving story story and 3 highlights: Reese Witherspoon's performance, which has kept his promise to the world of movies, the beautiful movie by Freddie Francis's "Old Lion" and the fantastic score by James Newton Howard, which is really soul of the movie. His term (which deserves an Oscar nomination) is so intimate and lyrical that it seems to have transformed the scenario into music.
