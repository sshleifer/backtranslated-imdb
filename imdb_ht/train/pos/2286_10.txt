The people who produced this film-maker made good service in a novel that means that the best-fit work fiction centered on guilty individuals and human responsibilities ever published. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr., and makes it clean, stays true to Vonnegut's deposition of a man who lost all (and) for love. <br /> <br /> There is no weakness in this fine adaptation.
