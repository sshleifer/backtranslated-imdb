Inspector "Room" Harry Callahan once again raged his superiors and his maverick approach to police work. Refuse to take a vacation to give a simple case that takes him out of San Francisco. However, he soon discovered a link between a recent killings of the city and an outside assassination of the city, leading him to the trail of a killer. <br /> As an entry into the movie room franchise begins with some very promising moments, including legends "Going forward, making my day" lines that Eastwood delivers beautifully to fermented teeth before one handedly foiling a thief. Very badass and it's just what fans can expect from him. However, the film fast gear gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is not all that mysterious as it is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who led all of his film appearance before and, pardoning the Pun, magnum force. <br /> <br /> On the bright side of this new storyline draws several Harry's own unorthodox approaches to parallels and gives his character to the dramatic depth that was not before, but fans who were looking for another Badass Harry out will be more than likely a bit shameful. However, a high-end climate ends the movie on an interesting note so if you do not mind something a little different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> Rated R for violence and a rape scene
