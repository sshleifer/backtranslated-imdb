This animated seriously launches my socks. When the first animation opened itself, I felt it was too slow; The story did not quite move forward, and Shirou was quite a lead without impressive men. Once he learns more about drawing, and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple aspects of it moving together. It was fantastic. <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the characters developed were very true to form and how the real people developed, in the real world. There was nothing absolutely stupid thing obviously going on; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the path Shirou and Saber grew up in certain personalities were just interesting to look at all about. A few of the "surprise" people who show up (Gilgamesh?) Seemed to be unique in the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning that we did not have the "Generic Bad-Ass" that were replaced by "Generic Bad-Ass B" as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I liked the music. Music in rocked openings, and the term ends out of the final episode just ... Seriously pushing forward the theme of the last episode even more. Good Work, Kind-MOON!
