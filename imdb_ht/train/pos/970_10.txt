Now I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but from each one there was a very selected few that was really good to me. And I'm a 19 year old man who is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all the acting is credible, graphics are decent (for which you will not even care about how you watch the movie. Trust me, bitching on the graphics that would be something stupid to do), the story is well written and It is a movie that everyone can enjoy not just kids. <br /> <br /> Here's basically what this movie has done to me. It's one, make me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel for the characters as you're supposed to, and three, it's a very uplifting story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what animated out there has not featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever they defeat some great evil. It is a very used formula. But in this case it is forgiven because even if they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you would see 5 years ago, the appearance of it must not be judged. It is very touching, the finish is original, and it keeps you in the movie as it is supposed to be. If you try to compare this to other movies like "The Never Ending Story" or whatever it will be your various opinions. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> It has been a long time since I was impressed like this. The only other movie where I had this feeling is when I saw TMNT way back when it came out. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So do not over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
