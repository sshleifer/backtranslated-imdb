Kurt Russell is at her best as the man who lives in his past globe, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is opposing her polar to a low performing key performance as Jack Dundee. It dropped the passage in more ways than one. <br /> You will see some of the most quotable scenes ever put in one movie, such as Jack herses in a rat, Reno pose, and call in Caribou to go out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic who is not afraid to show football in the mud in how it should play (notes in the NFL).
