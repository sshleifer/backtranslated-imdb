Surprise the candidate in this year's best animated feature feature of the Oscars. It is an Irish movie by heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, and, I guess, animation working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The character design is a little reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a couple of years back, with very simple and thick characters, explaining black. This movie is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is its use of colors, simply some of the most outrageous and thrilling use of colors I've ever seen. The overall design of the pictures is also a lot more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangular or oval. Many of the movie can spend playing the circle - an important aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscript (The Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible; the art of the movie based on drawing in it). The story of the movie is not especially deep, but it's a wonderful fantasy story. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls, built by his uncle to hold out Vikings. A New in Kells, Brother Aiden, inspired Brendan to capture illustrations. She also inspired her to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forest, in which to live a nymph. Bruno Coulais gives a fantastic note, almost as good as one of his works for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
