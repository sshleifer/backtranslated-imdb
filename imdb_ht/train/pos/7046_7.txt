At War, Inc. we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all activities related to the war we are currently making in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad you already half your home all appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a hit-firing firm called Hauser Haus which finds himself in Turquistan organizing a trade show in the newly released country as his cover while waiting to access his latest updates. While he found himself intrigued by the anti-government reporter played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the sexual pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, including a tragedy that has hated him ever since and the firm's assistant named Marsha Dillon who is currently running the whole operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack ). While some moments have been played decently on the head, they are not always the moment you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. All directors turn into solid performance. The Duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise it does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel his Disney image. Tomei is funny, but understated while Cusack's own almost every scene. To be fair, they provide good material. The writers turn into a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags keep you giggling along the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me in its rating higher as the torsion story and turns it into the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you love your great comedy and physical, there is probably not enough here to keep you interested in the entire movie. On the other hand, if you like seductive comedy and great satire, this is for you.
