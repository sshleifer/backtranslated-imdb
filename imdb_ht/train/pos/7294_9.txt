After reading several comments, I felt I had added to my two cents as well. "Mourning Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I've ever seen. I was lucky to see this at the New York Film Festival independent. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was very complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story focuses on a virgin who is abused by her abusive father. He is soon given the choice to "stop" him by a demon he played by "Eric Etebari Witchblade." Having watched the show, I was amazingly impressed with how he played this unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! Her character was deeply complex and she was very convincing. The act was absolutely superb by him. The girl was okay and the dad was decent. There's also death in this girl who is following around it is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely blurred. I wonder if at least a budget was a mile. It's rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtakingly comparable to any major feature film. This is not to say that it's not its flaw - I thought it took a little to go and the intro was a little bit longer. But this stuck on my head after watching it. There are very shorts and this level of quality.
