SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> Number 1 - TV Show All Time <br /> Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would not go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos became a cultural and universal phenomenon agreed as one of the largest TV shows ever. James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as anxious, loves the middle-class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superb graying consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> While the show has often been criticized for the negative stereotypes of Italian Americans as mafiosi, and at this level is undeniable, I can see many positives in the show. Portrait of solid value, friendship, love and compassion; Can this present in a coarse television show on gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues are discussed as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no funding, dulling on hard men and violence. It was a lot more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> This writing has been very great infused for problems successfully now and managed to imbred them into their characters' lives, making everything more exciting. <br /> <br /> must go to David Chase who created an excellent TV treasure with James Gandolfini, to consider, the more complex and enigmatic characters. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
