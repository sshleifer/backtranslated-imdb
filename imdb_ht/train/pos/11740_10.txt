I have no doubt that critics have panned this movie, especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative. This is a great movie movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When all is said & doing this is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie & forget your problem. It even has a simple message & moral qualities in no extra charge. I always love Elvira's television when I lived in LA. He did not really steal his schtick from Vampira over Vampira made out of the original, Theda Bara. This sort of mythical character belongs to people who make it better; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; We need more of these kinds of movies. Never have enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. She excited a wonderful refined mishis. I could get any technical error. The execution is as close to flawless as the art form becomes. My deepest impression of the director, James Signorelli, & his crew.
