Freedom with your own ocean boats goes away, the excitement of going on a rugged adventure adventures, a man of an adventurous and beautiful (and well-educated!) The fine bikinist assistants were all the finest selling points for the " SEA HUNT "(1958-61). Just what was the reason to produce a sort of sea will be" guns for hire "* series. Let's look right now. Must have a few clues around. If we were looking back just a little, we see RKO Photo Productions in UNDERWATER! (1955). She has starred Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of adventurous extreme diving adventures working on the Carribbean rescue, including a Pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for his story as for the looks of principals in swimming suits. Fine, cute folks brunette in some thirsty really tasty costumes 2 (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a plus for guys; and the presence of rugged, athletic male boys who show best beefcake "poses" are equally fun in the gals. So there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO Feature. It's about the soundtrack between the whole cries and the theme. It is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and made by Damaso Perez Prado and his Orchestra. Everyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (and Lyrics) will not quickly forget it. Bat its Carribbean is so very lively and its rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instantaneous impressions and memories. 45 RPM Record this song made it to the Top 10 Songs of the Week's most popular weekly Saturday on the NBC TV "HARD PARAD". We can not just remember how many weeks nor just how it was high. (Maybe some people can fill us in on one item please!) So we've returned to "SEA HUNT" with its own odyssey of getting on the "Tube". The public has been taken to UNDERWATER! all right, but they would go for a TV set. ZIV TV Productions has received a reputation for putting out a kind of product that, for the most part, was not signed off by the Network for the multi-zen-up treatment. But they have had some great success with TV broadcasts. ** By that we mean, offer a Station Series to show on one at a TV Station for each Market Zone. (Many such as the Unique Communications slogans "sell" comics in various papers around the Country, and World, even. <br /> So we got 'Mike Nelson', himself, in the physical presence of Mr. Lloyd Bridge The bridges have been around for about 15 years or so and have returned to some extremely memorable performances in mostly supported and highly varied roles in a couple of Boston movie cinemas (and Chester Morris) in their staging for CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and WHISTLE at EATON FALLS (1951). Lloyd has brought a very compelling character to it, along with a fine, convincing physical athlete, whose look at a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities.It was taken very well by the diver diver, whether he's doing homework on board boats, or fathoms under the sea. Lloyd has taken to the role quickly, but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with SCUBA .. before landing this Mike Nelson gig. Mr. Brid's ethics have proved to be a fast learner, as many of the shutter-shutter vaccines reveal that there was no doubt about it being Lloyd and the mask the bubbler (air tanks ) and flip the arrows. <br /> <br /> History is almost always involved in helping-out some customers to pay, much like a Private Detective would. So what if the client was a beautiful lady who looked good at the bathing suits, all the best. <br /> Like many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV productions, "SEA HUNT" owns a fine, haunted open Theme and Closure, with some original music and queens music. <br /> At one time, I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the top series Series Series, a success that ZIV Series was known earlier with the liking of "Theater Fiction Science" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As far as the venue shows for this underwater legend, here in Chicago it has been shown late night (after 10:30 PM) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (NBC affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV ). /> And then I can just remember who was the original sponsor of this particular market. And there was even on stage advertising by the Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding on his power raft. And as we have been invited to return next week and watch "... another adventure in" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company in LaCrosse, the Wisconsin 'Musicians of Old Style Bear Beer!", All while Mike was toasting us, raising an Old style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your moving boat! We'll say 'Coast Guard!') Then the boat would leave the pier, accompanied by the hunting hunting theme and rolling credit. / NOTE: * More figurative than Mike, Mike was to hire and stuff to run a lot like a detective story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course, SCUBA is an acronym for Systems including Underwater Delivery.
