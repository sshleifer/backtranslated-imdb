More mobile capabilities that kill entire army - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be targeted and still kill everything - Check! Mobile Costume based on Angels - Check! <br /> OK - its a set of Gundam. This one, Gundam Wings, has good character development, real world complexity, interesting ideas and some nice eye-candy. <br /> <br /> With the character, Relena Dorlan's weak character (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although it's still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy, the main character's character). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, tricky butcher, gets more and more people, while still remaining in-character. And to see the lost Millardo Peacecraft (who was the battle is Zechs Marquise) floating between OZ, freelancer, and the order in White Fang shows how few people can really lose themselves in their own creations. Political and military situation is also good - reflects how the real world works. However, in 49 episodes half hour, it gets a bit of a responsibility in that this complexity does not use its full potential. <br /> <br /> The ideas of the core of the series - the need to fight, the desire for peace, etc. - are those who are resonating even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the "Terrorist War" and all. But its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those in Treize Kushrenada, are an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the series. But sometimes good writing is sometimes very poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its corners. <br /> In terms of candy eyes, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything comes from the costumes to the Libra battleships (Not the stamps you are fools!) is priced, and explodes in Big orange balls (which are bad, because better animation would have better explosions). But who cares? Stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In how many though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few bits, you've been missing out on a lot. The poor page can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go "WTF?!?!" But this made up for its classic animation style, its scale, spark in incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration than one expected in these Japanese animations.
