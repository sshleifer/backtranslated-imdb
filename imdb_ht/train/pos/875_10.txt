Well, what can I say to have just watch this fantastic movie, when my nerves are still jangling! Jacques Audiard's director must make a name for himself in France, and that's why. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz either, but two are fantastic actors, and this is a thrilling and convincing thriller that starts slowly with some smart building buildings and then begins to put tension on tension in a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays their role in perfection, the director, actors, right down to the cameraman, and everything seems so real , there is no stupid playing play, the battle when it comes to so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost as you are there as a spectator. Make yourself a favor, find the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the light lights, take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
