Simply put, this is the best movie from Michigan since ... well, ever! Dead is wrong to feed your heart out, Hatred in a minute was some of the oddest, and the best movies to be seen by this review in a long time. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a top travel, or a good case of their wishes!
