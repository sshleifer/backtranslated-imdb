The film is largely enjoyable with a great cast, with excellent direction by James Eves. The fun movie with a very charisma performance from Stephanie Beecham and everyone is perfectly thrown. James Eves has a good eye for filing and directing as a conductor who knows exactly when they go up the action, fall and then climb to a better score. It does with an element of humor, many twists, emotions and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and shout. The movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie does not take itself too seriously with plenty of action language in a blow. Great!
