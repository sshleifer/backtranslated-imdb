"Elvira, Mistress in the Dark" is a sort of "Harper Valley P.T.A." and touch of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks in his work as TV terrorist TV host after the new station's owner gets cool with him. She now relying on a Las Vegas show to bring her into, but learn she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise this money until it receives a notice about her death of her aunt, who takes Elvira to Massachusetts for reading the will. A home in need of repair, a dog, and a book is all that leaves him by his tent, and yet it seems Elvira has trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. Adults in the small and narrow minded cities make things worse by making things harder for Elvira. Only the local couple (Daniel Greene), and a group of adolescents will befriend it. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard), writes a deal with Elvira cooking, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage including spellcasting, and a couple of squares very effective. Elvira does not want to sell food to his uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on knowing in his power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake in the old town's charge of magic, and the confrontation between her and her uncle. The plot is very simple, but the humor and well-developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. "Elvira, Mistress in the Dark" is full of beautiful, gross, steamed, and humorous smell brought in by the numerous eye gags, puns, props, songs, and parody. Touch the movie in the lens to make this the best parody ever to do. It's a well-done and terrific movie acting by all performers; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (in "Greece.") There are also wonderful special effects. Many people (including myself) wonder if the character Elvira was able to bring a feature film, and the answer is delightful, YES!
