Even though I saw this movie, I was familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> I had to do some research, to ensure I was not actually affiliated, as with his character, and (well?), what he was afflicted with. I was in absolute tremor in this beautiful lady. He pulled it perfectly. Who would have thought that clear sex circumstances involving the final wish, and need of a young unique lady, could be interpreted as sensitive, and romantic? Well, they can, when the performers right present them in the proper way, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamic Miss Carter looks at this movie. I have often said that it was the most beautiful animal ever to graced the figure in our soil, but it seemed to have come out to make himself in this particular film. <br /> I hope that any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
