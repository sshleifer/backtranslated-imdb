"California" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny sued, a river running through it, and the legends of the fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (X The records) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Life on the Street, and Escape From LA) as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's Girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Cold Feather, Cape Fear, and the contents of Gilbert Grape's food) as Adele corner, the early girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, getting ready to write a book about serious assassination.Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie decides to want to move to California, so Brian puts an ad At the college for some people who want to go to California, they share travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a senior and sociopath of freedom, who has recently lost his job at the ice factory in town, is in debt, owed its owner's money. European freedom officer stopped to visit him and told him about a job. Try to go to the Collar to link and see the ad and read later Adele, his girlfriend on leaving to go to California.Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town.Brian and Carrie do not know that he is an assassin who just kills him the owner. For a while while Brian and Carrie thought of Happiness and Adele different but had come to know them and They get sort of friends, Carrie and Adele become real good friends. <br /> <br /> Travel is a very learning one. Even if Brain and Carrie do not know early is an assassin until later on in the movie.Brian in question asks in this movie about the difference between bloodthirsty and we are a very good question. Early Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the mistake in his way, down hill later on and pay the price. <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, "Look In Heaven" by Indians them.
