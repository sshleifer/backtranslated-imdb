Gang of Roses. "Each rose has its thorn." A mixture of old west and hip hop, blended perfectly together. The clothing styles, scenery, and scheme are all adapted to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Draw - in five years, they stole twenty-seven banks and then disappear without a trace. Now a small western city is besieged, and one of the victims first is Rachel's sister. The rose gang is ready to ride again. Then it's the staff. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five gunslinging women who split up after five years of riding together. When Rachel's sister dies, she ends up rounding up her friends once again and riding on a revenge trail. <br /> A good, movie around the western version. (If you've seen bad girls, well this is a little better in the ways of the female characters). <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, drawings and scenery made it to me.
