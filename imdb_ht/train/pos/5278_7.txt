What starts out as the generation's conflict in this film, completes in understanding, solitude and favor. The film meanders in Europe and the father and the young son crumble in a car over 3000 miles. The strength of life, belief and life skills to collide. There are really no clear winners. It all adds up to the end as experience, experience in multiple layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle outlook, without pushing on the agenda. It's a come in the age story of the young son, his dismissive and rebellious nature turns open to get more way of life.
