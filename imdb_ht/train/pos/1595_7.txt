While I might say I enjoy the show, I expect something completely different from when I first saw 'What I love about you' I hope to find something on the lines of 'all that' (I'm not sure if it's will be over again) but I said I do show and while I do not classify it as a tool show, it's pretty good and I'm doing like the chemistry between the characters as well (including the throw of support) <br / > <I would definitely say that it is great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really love him in City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's friends in Popular and while I think was an okay show, I do not really like her character in this show because it's just not my cup was but she's judged out pretty well
