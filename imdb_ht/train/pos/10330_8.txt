This is actually a trilogy of 3 in Somerset's Maugham's short story. The first is the Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years Albert Foreman is set to work for his church because he can not read or write. So what does he do? Open a tobacco shop, of course! <br /> The second is Mr. Knew-All was actually a story I read for school 6 years ago and immediately forgotten until I heard the introduction familiar. Another 15 minutes one, and also very good. He worked best on film than in a book for me, but then maybe this because I was only the last 14, after. <br /> <br /> The 3rd one is almost a let-down. Almost an hour of length, it simply drags. It's not all that bad, but not as quick and dynamic as last 2. I watched the first hour quarter of it and then jumped forward in last quarter hour, and found that it always makes sense to really I did not miss something! <br /> Overall I give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.
