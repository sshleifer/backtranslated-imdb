This is a great movie, it shows what our government will be in other countries if you do not like their governments. This is not as bad as Reagan and Bush number one made in South America, but the US still has no business pity around and other countries like this. These films also prove that American media dispersed government propaganda. This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason for this coup against Chavez does not succeed is Chavez being elected with more than 90% of votes. This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it was a drama, it's amazing that this is real. <br /> <br /> The other review goes when it says "Chavez surprised the airwaves", the private media are running anti-propaganda Chavez all the time.
