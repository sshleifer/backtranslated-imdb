Most filmed, well-acting, movie movies movies tightly. There was me on the corner in my place. I liked the actress lead a lot, and think the villain was very well done. Not much chew over here in the path of a theme, but if you just get into your seat, turn your brain, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well torn, and regular movie visitors will probably know more or less what they expect in about ten minutes in. But this did not bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In ancient times, they could not focus so tightly about just two characters, and there were some catchy moments when I hoped they would let some others have a few lines. But these folks probably have the right to keep the movie in focus. The plot got me through the throat early, and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. as I'm not sure he does a great deal of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
