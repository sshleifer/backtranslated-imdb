The line, of course, is from the Lord's prayer - "you will do on Earth as it is in the sky." Sweden, especially far north, is not my mind in the sky -30 degrees C winter temperatures are a little bit on my side, but the good folk who live there is no doubt thinking in their own country of God a. <br /> The scenario here is a familiar one. Acclaimed Daniel International Music Danyen suffered health hanging among careers, going back to the little village in northern Sweden where he was born. The chairman of the local pastor helps out with the church choir, turning some talent into a class of acts, and entering a contest held in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (regret) of the band players in "Stir off" the models of "Girl Calendar" and the dancers in "The Full Monty". But of course it causes many emotional changes as some of the more downtrodden villages achieve their worth and rebellion against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing except death that will stop him. <br /> Despite the story of a small meeting, we get to know and dear to the characters, who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognized "kind." I did wonders on the wife-stick being punished for so long. Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is very strongly deterred (it was also a bit young is one of the young Daniels) The puritanic pastor and a secret passion for girls magazine was a bit of a stereotype, but wondering realized by Niklas Falk. Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful like Daniel, frail but hands-on musician, and some nice music too. I was moving for all two hours. The end is what you do in it, I guess, but it does not spoil it in saying Daniel realizes what he put out to do.
