I recently (May 2008) discovered that this favorite kid was available as a DVD. Although I've seen a great deal of high quality film since then (late 70's (I was 10 in 1978)), this three-episode, low budget stuff still stands strong. <br /> <br /> What's fun is that I now look at her with my 10 year old daughter, and she experiences the same as I remember at back then: The creepy music (he kept my hand, though he was raised and watching LotR and Resident Evil), ever change the theory in which the culprit actually is, and also complains about the theaters from a previous era to discover the difference between acting and acting films. This is one and only good science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's always worth seeing.
