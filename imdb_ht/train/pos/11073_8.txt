I never knew in a movie arousing such debates in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will eventually be remembered as a classic ever. I was waiting for anticipation for this movie as I had already liked both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely love this movie and I can not wait to see it again. This film is totally different in both of the aforementioned Ritchie films, and also a lot better. I have to choose from favorite directors, but none of them has been pulling on a move as fast as Guy Ritchie just does with this movie. I believe he has taken film-making at another level (I know most people are laughing at this comment managing this movie reaction, but I think time will prove to me right). This movie is very confusing and brought on for much longer than the 2hr time or so run as I could not stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together. I have now a very good take on everything that comes to this film (some answers from endless hours of thinking, some answers from other people's reading on the movie) and now can not wait until Sunday when I see him again. I just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and will hopefully reward as I and many others have been.
