This movie is about two guys who have made up a sport on the ground trying to get 2 to get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a sport nationwide. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but he hated when he lost the NBA to some other rival teams. She meets the girl in her dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and at the end kiss. The first time I saw this movie I wet my pants it was so funny. A definite must be seen for all comedy fans. If you love South Park you will love this! Maybe not to watch with her kids is kind of suitable for little dudes. Some dudes give it 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it 11 out of ten. i love coop my rock i have to go to thank you for reading this
