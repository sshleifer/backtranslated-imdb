I would say for her when that movie was scary ... and yes if you have no idea to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving. I see them now taking these movies to another level and creating the series Behind Behind ... they run a close comparison and definitely are most modern to reach people. I think that in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I'm not mistaken ... Do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie for yourself ! ! God will bless you if that's why you're watching them.
