I saw this pilot when he first showed, and I'm sure countless fans of "hate" hate him, because, like Batman, the Green Cold etc., he took the character toward "camp". But I'm obviously never enough in Batman, because I thought it was fun, in some of the same ways as that show. There are two parts left with me. First, when Denny's partner was tired of injuries, she made a dramatic speech about how she was still standing for the law, and obeyed the exact letter of her. Then he said something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" Which is how it tells Denny to become a rather vigilant, which he does (even if the Batman Batman TV). Then there's the stage where she tried to seduce the villainess by letting her go to kiss her, but she is not deceived, because she was too honest to kiss her compelling! This is a great example of "camp", which was also "underplayed", by both the actor and actress.
