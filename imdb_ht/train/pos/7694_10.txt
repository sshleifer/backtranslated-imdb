I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die in the show again? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they were struck home and the issues they had faced. By the way, have they ever made it out of the ghetto? I think the episode and Jesus's blackness were my favorite. We got to see them experience a few good times. Something they did not have very often. I wish they would bring the show back. During the day, so people can actually stay up to look. I do not think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you !!
