Fabulous movie! Rent the DVD recently and was floating by this stunning piece of work. Douglas Sirk was a filming engineer and he performed performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nomination), and Lauren Bacall that words can not be described. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly pays homage to this film by Dorothy Malone playing Sharon Stone's social inspirational inspirational guru in his basic instincts. What a great joke! <br /> The movie is hilarious, steady, biting, biting, trashy, compelling, and rolling in sight! It's definitely the grandaddy of each soap screens and soap screens but there has not been the dazzling style as you'll see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening opening set of chan Song title is beyond memorable, the one-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will have to scratch yourself as how the sinner back then let it make the final cut! <br /> While older, highly regarded films can sometimes have a boring chore to sit down, writing on the wind is very much and goes so fast that it actually is a shame when it ends. Thanks to Sirk for crafting - with Todd Haynes to attract attention - what has now become one of my favorite films ever! See this PHOTO !!!
