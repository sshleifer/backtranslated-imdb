This movie is not about entertainment, or not even a movie you want to see to spend the time. This movie is truly a display of true love that can only be from God. One can not help but touch deeply by watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contributes to this movie's value. God's divine divine beauty is very well described. God's love transcends hearts and minds and endures forever. There is love in a marriage. While the main grapples and his wife's illness, he realized in God's love that he loved his wife more than she could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have love for children and parents. Children in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love does not make any good if it gives one another. I pray this film can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen !!
