The tightrope market between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in movies. How do you get to laugh from others' misery and not start feeling bad when it's gone too long? <br /> Well, this surprising little gem in a movie will deliver great laugh, great scenery, and quite a good buzz as well. I particularly love the concept that a trick of history has made legal alcohol since European white loved it, and illegal marijuana, since 'these other races' used it ... without doubting true and exposed a racial side of the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world. <br /> An extraordinary "Extra DVD" comment ... two of them in fact ... run across the entire movie with both the actors, and then again with the writers. I kept things I was sure was not in the first movie, but then realizing how easy it is to miss a lot of the subtle comedy on taking first. What a hoot! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
