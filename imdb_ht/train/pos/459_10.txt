This is the best series of its kind I've seen all year long. I can not help thinking it just my luck - a series I like to become 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie booth shows never-ending episodes. <br /> I think the new reasons that tricks succeed greatly. The scripts are good, and the mix of superb characters, the act is top flight, and the mix of comedy and drama works a treat. The stories are not all that memorable, but that's not the reason I watch shows like this one. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite, and we were disappointed to find it not available in any published edition. Great things, BBC - a sex-appealing triumph (aside from the young people of the building there are as eye-lolly, and even if it IS, it can still act!).
