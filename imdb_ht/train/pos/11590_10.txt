Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. I was more of a movie visitor then. I now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my house rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I've finally been able to pick up more information from your site. Thanks ........ I am surprised to see that this short film was an opening for a Disney picture. I also did not remember the Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney. I really want to show that on TV sometime. I wonder if Disey holds these movie rights? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
