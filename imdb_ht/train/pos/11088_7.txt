The Egyptian in this film is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing, that's what I guess to do it so mean. I do not think most boys would love this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wives. This is one of those very beautiful movies very much at the very end. But then you have it, a candy-bar finish that makes me look back and says, "HOKIE AS HELL." A very good movie until the end. Ending is the end we want to see but does not end in such a beginning. Then there is the consequence of what happened. Guess you can make up your own idea about the true finish. I left feeling that only one character should survive in the end.
