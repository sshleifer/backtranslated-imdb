The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of funny characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent pecker (played by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Matt Pecker's friend ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Chrissy's sister Pecker's (who is addicted to sugar), and the Grand Potter Pecker who discovered life in a statuette The Virgin Mary in her room. The film slowly makes a point on how everyday life has a lot of wealth offered, and it succeeds in making this point without too heavy-handed on it. There is always a risk, when message about the value and dignity of "common people", in the slump of a kind of reverse "holier than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing breathing for viewers to compare this message to their own ideas on the subject. <br /> I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun.
