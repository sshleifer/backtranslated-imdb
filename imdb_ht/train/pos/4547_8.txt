This would be a 10 if it was not for the well-predicted and hollywood-ich scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not the leader I can ask) and the rest of the stand at a very high level. I personally was impressed with Hugh O 'Connor who played Christy Brown as a kid. The very first scene I watched was really strong. Wow.
