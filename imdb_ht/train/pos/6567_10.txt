Most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who were not too critical or maybe expecting something else. This is one of my favorite movies from the 80 's, it grows on you, and it has it all. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, it has lots of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. Add to that chases the big car, automatic gun shootouts and lots of things blowing up and you have a fun, corner of your chair experience! You will even be shining or whistling the main theme theme for days after seeing this. <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you'll both enjoy it very much. The first is that of an ebook ebook hero, such as Doc. Savage, really existing and helping people fight evil so it can write the story is almost true in life here. The actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and writer of many films. In this movie Jake Speed ​​(character) is an Indiana Jones adventurous type, he usually uses himself to get out of gigantic but sometimes resourceful firepower resorts (yay !, and absolute dumb luck too!). Keeping an eye out for its one-sided "James Bond" hi-tech equipment, the ultimate valiant SUV route is thrown out of the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is pretty much interesting to the young love from the early vampire Jim film "Once Bitten" and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to teens she blonde little sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are "real bad" men and they are the lowest lowlife love hate. The finish is just perfect and can stand alone or invite an end, sadly never did - but you can just imagine what would happen next! <br /> You have to see this movie just because it will entertain and entertain you with this worth the cost of a ticket.
