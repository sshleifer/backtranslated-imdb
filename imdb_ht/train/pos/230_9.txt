When I first saw this film on cable, he instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film depicts an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes were from Soll, an old landing owner who used prisoners to work. Should this be the move, its comic ramblings gives us the insights into the South way back then. I suppose if Soll lived today it should be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. No less his attitude towards a boy who comes to work for him, and the prisoners are complex. While he has racist opinions, he has grown up to trust some of the prisoners who are all black. The prisoners he believes are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in great performance as well as Hass. This film should have gotten more notoriety. However it's DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
