When a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's artist for a while now, with some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something full of satisfaction, and quite a bit more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay), finding inspiration in our environment makes good art is imperative, and it's something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. After her over the course of one year, the director captured the spontaneity, skill, and devotion of art and nature connections with flair inspired flair. The music set in the film is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or anyone else who needs an experiment, then see this picture. I'm one I'm happy to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Create, dance, struggle and nature forces to make our world the most beautiful.
