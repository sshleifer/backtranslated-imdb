Love it or read it, it's hard not to get Warren Beatty to take on "Dick Tracy," the 1990 adaptive film of Chester Gould's comic strip, funny short of a classic genre. Superhero films have come out of the woodwork in recent years, and can soon become a genre all on its own. The Beatty movie freely uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting at all six of the main color strips, and thus giving this unique world to unfamiliar to gang-triggered happy and mutually gang- Women seduce a lush visual and tone visual style. <br /> It can be stated that the strong aesthetic film visually quite high - Changing the characters and their ability to act, which I do not think can be any further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" relies in its look with crazy characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged with incorruptible detectives of the title, is accordingly stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs. Other than the visual treatments with Oscar-winning makeup, there is a draw, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, succinctly on-the-top Oscar nomination), seeks to eliminate Tr Acy in a well-planned move, but also seek to control all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gloves under it. Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have her, staying faithful to her and taking care of kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a dad's face to look up to our crime-crazy hero. Tracy Tess's faithfulness is tested by the tempting progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also the Big Boy's main press. At the same time that all these things will go down, things will become warm when a new criminal figure reaches town, and decides to play both sides against the middle. <br /> <br /> Performance is good, as Beatty's focus on the tense and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just focusing on useless actions and special effects. Pacino's freeway scenery in a role that is truly exceptional to the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most neglected in the comic book comic genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty to take on his beloved crime-fighting detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
