Having placed the sitcom earth with 'Ted Ted' Arthur Matthews and the next Graham Linehan creation was a memorial for BBC called 'Hippies' although created by the scary-six scripts written by Arthur Matthews alone li. <br /> <br /> Place in London in 1969-Ray Purbs, a hippie, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his flat-mate, turned into highly placed and cannabis smoking Alex, his 'girlfriend' is feminist Jill and none of Hugo's too bright. Simon Pegg was superb as Ray, but it is superb to everything he's in. This sitkon has a feeling of 'Citizen Smith' on him. Ray was so much like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserable. At last this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was over in 1999 and has again been repeated on terrestrial television - my memory is not too good at the sitcom, but I recall two episodes really clearly, the first being the 'Hippies' cover box that I thought was a great start - where Ray goes on a protest against paper and the other episode was 'hippy dippy hippie' that I think was episode 4, yet quite a clear memory of the Police. Unfortunately, the site has received a negative reaction from viewers (I can not think why). The BBC has commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decides against it because of the negative reaction. Oh, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> Best Episode: Hippie Dippy Hippie-Series 1 Episode 4.
