Yeah make sure it is cheese, it's not zombie, but it's not bad either. It has Beatrice Ring which is a great bonus, and it's fun. I had the great chance to meet Fulci later in his career and remain philosophical about the experience, as he never was completely satisfied with it. It is well worth a search out, especially for genre and fans of Fulci. It is a movie that is far too often dismissed from hand.
