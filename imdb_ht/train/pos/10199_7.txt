As a kid, I loved this game. I played it once a million times during the spring of 1993 and my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and it would be Adam and no matter how many times we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 comes out. And we quickly forgot that this one had existed. <br /> You play as former Axel Stone cops, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who left the whip in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels of work until a run-down and city corruption led by Evil Mr X. Beat all the bad guys and end-of-level boss is lots of fun. Level 4 (Bridge) has been locked up because you could chuck baddies down the rivers in the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. Mr. X's right hand at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad finish' in which you become the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the union on your way to Mr. X, but never mind. <br /> <br /> Streets of rage also had really fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro performed absolute miracles with limited technology in the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are tunes. <br /> As a Wii owner I'm proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does make the first kind of somewhat outdated. <br /> <br /> Why Average graphics but nice graphics represent in a comic book-like progression panel that fits the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Easy to get in and hard to put down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well inferior in the infinitely more complex streets of Mania 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially upset with Level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> Lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of normal decent. too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gamer B- Long-Term Appeal B-
