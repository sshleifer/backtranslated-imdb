Probably the best of the Producers Releasing Corp's ever made, this little horror piece attracted attention from the last one. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one of his most important things to know how to achieve all of his potential shock on the screen. Not only is the plot involved with the characters captivatingly drawn, but the environment is absolutely out of this world! Just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a stuck, ubiquitous fog. This atmosphere of refreshment is enhanced in the direction of the inventive Wisbar and their performance persuasively convinced he was drawn out to all his players. Lovely Rosemary The floor makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, bravest yet vulnerable. Robert Barrat delivers normal no-nonsense, straight-down-line portrait of the local bigwig, though it is hard to believe that the character, the good-looking guy who plays his son is no other than later dullsville writer / director Blake Edwards.
