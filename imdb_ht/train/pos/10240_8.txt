Genre: dinosaur, animation, New York, travel time, circus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs The Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.? What happens: dinosaurs (see above) to eat some "brain cereals" and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs that will make beautiful children. They go to New York, with great plans ?? <br /> <br /> Think My: This is a beautiful animated movie. The animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit flimsy and not-so-good, but they look pretty much the same way. I love dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I love (almost) all the featured characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I love the others as well. In general, I love this movie very much! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who love animated films, dinosaurs, John Goodman and those who think circuses are not always what they look like ?? Enjoy! :-)
