in one of Neil Simon's best games. Critical, averting former Vaudeville star played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are teaming up for a special TV comedy. The problem is not to see each other in more than a decade. Filled in one lobster stylist and showbiz joke inside, this story flew along with a steady stream of humor. Good work also performed by Richard Benjamin as the nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as the nurse, and Howard Hesseman as the TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia notes: The opening opening has footage from Hollywood Revue in 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards, and Brox Sister songs.
