I liked this movie a lot. I rent this waiting something that is not too bad an evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so much of a movie not intended to be just a slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral value. It manages on both counts.The hearts are indeed but the guy's star, too was written with the film product. I never saw any of these previous actors, but they were likable and cared about what is happening at the end saying a lot.The script is smart and involved and has a refreshing feeling of li. I think you will not be disappointed to watch this.
