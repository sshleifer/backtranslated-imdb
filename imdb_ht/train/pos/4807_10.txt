I really thought that this movie was superb. Not only the story is correct, but the style is rich and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's paintings in Victoria and how she kept her mind even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her teens. Blunt painted charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the film, so genuine and sensitive that at the end of the movie you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in the mourning of Albert .. The technical aspects of the movie are worthy of note too . I appreciate the beautiful note, which moves quite well along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered that the movie is exceptional, some scenes let me suffer because of the lushness and beautiful to describe. <br /> There were the few years this year as beautiful and sensitive as this movie and it rates as one of the best 2009!
