I searched this one after seeing the linguistic and linguistic challenge of the "Clueless" (1995), possibly known as Alicia Silverstone's efforts since early in his film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, which would be useful in improving the most films. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only desire I think the movie has for me is a "feeling" awkward in some of the scenes, from the need to run a well-off, grow theme as part of what's tone starting out as a schoolgirl adventure . /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is very good at this one. It brings in the enthusiasm of naive and growing annoyance that affects Mari Giordano as it maneuver towards the truth behind the serious murder. I figured it's characterization of MG has some mileage in it too. The inference of the story line is that it goes to a career in law enforcement. It might be really interesting for a older Silverstone to review Giordano at a later time crisis in the life of the officer. Just a thought! <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also had the credit written. I do not know of any other PV film works. I can only ask what happened after a promising start. Like most productions, this one has a support throw justified widely, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly so. Over the past decade it seemed to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. I remember seeing her recently in "Carriers" (1998), a made for TV presentation with a military term. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic television comedy television "Who in the Boss" may also have an interest in "Carriers" because the leading player is Judith Light, remembering and affectionate because of his long participation with the show. /> "True Crime" could easily not work, but it's OK. I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing.
