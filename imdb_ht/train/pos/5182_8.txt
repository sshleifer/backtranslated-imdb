A quiet, sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie about how it is to be confronted with old friends and environments from your teens and all that memory and trouble and sorrow in the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old witch, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Difficulties, switcher-switcher-night and other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader is now retiring and wanting to meet children from the golden years in the camp. All of them are now in the thirties and in the middle of their careers.
