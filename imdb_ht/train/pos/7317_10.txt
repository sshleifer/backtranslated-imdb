This was a movie that I heard about my life growing, but never seen it until a few years ago. It's true that she started reading it. I knew Michael Myers, seeing the mask, saw the advertisement for all the sequels followed. But I grew up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was cheated and compromising hitting cheap. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really terrifying movie. Now, by today's standard, it is not like graphics and viscosity, but this movie delivers on all the other levels of movie cinema fail to realize today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a picturesque, mid-west city is a test of his abilities. The lighting effects are downright worried, and the "shapes" seemingly appear and disappear in the shadows of will. But simple but brutal notes are only added to the suspension. Performances are not all players well done, and specifically nods Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. It's all the scary plus when it's backed by Michael Myers because the director and visualizer have invested so much of it, we want him to survive and get. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis loves a man on a mission, and works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the situation the city finds itself in because it knows what street street is wrong. <br /> <br /> In general, not only is Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lifts up. This would be standard look for anyone who wants to experience a really scary movie. And for a even more frightful time, try to look it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see the "fitness" cache around in the shadows!
