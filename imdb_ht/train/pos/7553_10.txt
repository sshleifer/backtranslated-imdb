When I saw this film a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. Its greatness has kept my attention as an extent that I focus all of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend seeing it not just animated fans, but anyone who likes great movie periods (or who likes really unusual stuff). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbol of it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strangest insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way it does is complementary to the unusual style of the movie. Self-attribution description attributed to "Hello Kitty on Acid" by making this film virtually in absolute seasons. I would like to get more work by people who did this, and see them.
