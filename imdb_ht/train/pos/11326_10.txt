I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I was not interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a h-game, which I'm not sure if it did before or not, I have not played the game, but in what I've heard it follow well. <br /> I give this series a 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animation I've seen. It also has some great Japanese music in it too! <br /> If you have not seen this set again, check it out. You can get target episodes on some animated websites out there and straight from Japan.
