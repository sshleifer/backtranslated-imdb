I loved almost all the films in the Harry Hall series with the exception of one I think has the title "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was a bit weak in the area, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites in the series, if there is nothing else for the big line of "Go ahead, make my day". This one also features an interesting albeit familiar to the plot of murder that made him wrong. Just think "Magnum Force" and less mystery about who is behind the killings, and you have to draw you. Granted there is a bit more than this one featuring a very nice showdown in an amusement park. It also features Harry's Room will receive a bulldog as a gift and it's tripping up Sandra Locke in a rather funny scene. The only remaining question is why Clint Eastwood was the singer Sandra Locke's inductive actress in many of his movies. It brings the score down one point every time the overall movie is enjoyable. Granted it's not bad here, but his character could be so much better than another. Another problem with this movie and other Harry movie cinema, at times almost seems to have advertisements for guns. I love the gun as the next person, but we really need the scene to explain all the different forces in his new weapon and how many bullets it holds? Still, very nice to go in the Harry room series in movies.
