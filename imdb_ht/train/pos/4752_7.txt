An angry story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth. (Things must be very bad back on Mars.) State troops investigate the scene of a reported UFO accident. Whatever it was landing buried under the ice at Tracy Pond but there are traces of the snow leading to a nearby diner. <br /> <br /> The diner had no customers since eleven ten hours this morning. Now, a handful of bus passengers sit beside waiting for permission to cross a structural bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are currently few people waiting for the trip to be resumed. One of them is a stranger, but which one? They are all suspected. There's the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub pink rush. There is a blizzard businessman who must arrive in Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on the bees. (Honorary executives, Ron Kipling.) Except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. And even the couples are suspecting each other. The bride recently strikes husband: "I swore that you had a mule on your chin." The story continues in a spontaneous way, but a little spooky - the phone rings for no reason, the lights go over and over, the geck box turns itself over - and none of it is to be taken seriously. /> It's a pretty enjoyable ensemble game and the climate revelation is worth a chuckle. No "depth" is determined by it. It's not a moral message about masquerade pods as normal citizens. It's not a warning about any kind, just a storytelling story with Amus. <br /> I always enjoy it when it's over. It's especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the businessman is impatient and impatient, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who mastered the murder of Julius Caesar in the MGM version of Shakespeare's play. And here it is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
