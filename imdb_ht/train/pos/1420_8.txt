At Disney World's celebration, the film "Earth" was released. Suspiciously short of any strident message of gloom and bankruptcy, we are treated at excellent footprints of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves. The stars in the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a candle and its bull. The narrative begins at the North Pole and continues to the south until we reach the tropics, all while being introduced to the denominators in the various climatic zones crossing. <br /> <br /> Global warming mentioned in while we see the misery of polar bears; Scores are made to the ice slush island in recent years. We never saw the bears catch any seals, but the desperate search of the father for food brought him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The aerial vaccines of caribou migration through the tundra is one of the most spectacular animals I've ever seen; He and another of wildfowl migration are sufficiently rewarding the price of admission to see them on the big screen. <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks captured the seals were filmed slowly. Never get the sense of a wild beast characteristic; incredible speeds. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie conveyed great speed I think started with (or at least it's the first I remember seeing) the TV show "Kung Fu" for the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting sidelight that as the credit rolls during the end some manifestations of the cinematic techniques used to reveal. There is enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments of this movie making it a solid choice for nature frameworks. Perhaps because of some selective corrections (limiting us, as it was, from the end to grisly at a predatory-predatory time) and the fact that this foot was released in 2007 and available on DVD it is a solid film of its own its rights. And you can take your kids! <br /> Three stars.
