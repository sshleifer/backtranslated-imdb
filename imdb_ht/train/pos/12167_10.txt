What happens when someone has so many social concerns that they stop working? How can one alone find it? When the mantra crap we have to do in order to become part of society gets too much, what's going on? Frownland explores these questions. Definitely a first original typing from Bronstein. The tone is weird and claustrophobic as we get inside the idea of ​​a guy named Keith who is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence. We follow it around how it tries to make contact with people and day function days. Most of us knew people like that-those who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there like this but why someone wants to make a movie about them? Well, because its interesting with Bronstein and the lead actor, Gore Mann, does an excellent job. This movie is about as un-commercial as a movie can be found. A few friends filmed her over the course of some years as they saved money. He was shot on 16mm and looked at scratchy film is very low budget. With no distributor, this can be a hard one to find, I think it has been screening randomly for the past year or so. Hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it at Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, among them Crispin Glover, who tells you about how unusual this movie is. Very recommended.
