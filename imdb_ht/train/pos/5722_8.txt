This was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I ever saw. It was not bloody and intestinal, it was weird, atmospheric and dire. When the mommy ghosts lent on the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was concerned that the American version would be watering down, and that Buffy would take away the black nuances of climbing in the original version. I do not have to worry about it. The musicians in this film wisely kept the same Japanese people involved in the original movie by hand, and gave direction to the movie the same person. They also put him in Japan at the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took pains in removing the film as it was in the original, the only difference was being dropped by American actors. That actually turned into a benefit as it added elements of "foreigners in a strange country" to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but were also stuck in a completely foreign land, struggling to integrate into society. It just adds to the general anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy actually does a very good job. It looks vulnerable and can convey it frightening it well. There are no of the smart gock remarks that are so common in American horror movies, or a material that is detected from the overall darkness and terror in their characters' status. In fact, it was easy as good as the ring that I am well enjoying. I hope the future of American horror follows Japan's best New Wave of Horror started with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally receive movies that can actually be categorized as "horror" !! 8/10
