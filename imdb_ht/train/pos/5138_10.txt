Back in 1994, I had a really long vacation around the fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what and two weeks paid vacation, weekends and holidays in itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out of my parents' home much. <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment so I used to look at my parents tube. I just finished watching a segment of the X files when a program came up to call personal FX. I was wired immediately. I have always been fascinating with our home item that came from my parents' family home and the heritage from family estates, and often amazed about the stories, values, etc. , I used to go to my folks home on my lunch just to catch personal FX. <br /> I can remember an episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in that series was filmed by being renovated and that once said the renovations were completed by Personl FX would return the hour. <br /> <br /> It never did! Personal FX was the first and best - in the collection shows. And it disappears in the air! Nearly fifteen years later, I still hurt. <br /> <br /> Way to go, FX.
