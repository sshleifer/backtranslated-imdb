While Urban Cowboy did not bother with the same testosterone you could get into a rodeo, it gave an accurate glimpse to this day and age, in Texas. I also think that in really criticizing this movie, one should have lived in the time and relative where he did. There was good music, fun times, yes, a few "rough and tumbles" in the highway freeway highways. The relationship of Bud and Sissy, like "two ships spent in the night," were well conceived. When Pam tore the note that Sissy wrote in Bud, he echoed the tragedy in many romance life. The whole story was thought out. I thought that the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the play was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should receive an Oscar for the best actor to support.
