In 1979, I was a boy of 12 years old, my parents just got home-made new office in our neighborhood. As a 12-year-old boy, this was the first time I saw seniors on TV. I will never forget this joy. Racing trucks, the total donkey-drying and the baddest wind, the water bed, smoking in herbs, the 70's hot chicks, the love of Makin in my van my wind, was all those new to me. A full movie with all the memories you can expect for. I own it and enjoy it once a year. When I watch this movie, it makes me want to get my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a narrow line, going to the park and hunting some baby and feather hair. really great memories of teenage adolescence!
