This film was poorly received and seriously reviewed. The book by Rebecca West was written in 1918, soon after WWI, when shock shocks and shock-induced amnesty were not revoked, as the review reads many books and movies later. It's hard to return to time and to live, as the characters lived, the facts of the moment: the war and horror of the first war's war to use lethal gas, the British class system's wife thought all important- , the hopeless spinster, and the lover of the past still see and the eyes of love were as young and beautiful as it was 20 years ago. Alan Bates as the Amyak soldier who "will die" if he does not allow Margaret, the girl of his juvenile dream, to build on the devotion his character showed in "far from the Madding crowd". When you see that performance, it is possible for her sense of strong romantic attachment for the girl who did not live up to family and society expectations. Margaret said, "We are against, and as you've rowed away, you turn your face away from me." So we know that the separation was something that he encouraged, that he was wearing shame, but that he forgot the shame of his memory in his time with Margaret. I have not seen all his films, but of those I have seen, he slows a strong manhood, which shines in the same role as a disabled soldier. <br /> I did not even recognize Ann-Margaret at first and felt her performance was underrated. Did not read the book, I was whether the dying child was the result of acting on an unbridled boundary line between Jenny and Chris, though Jenny said he was "a cousin." The Kitty kitty holds Jenny in the nursery at the hair-dry stage, the fact that Kitty says she always dries her hair in that room looks more a bit way for Kitty to keep the charts in hot anger than the orientation of the room in the sun, or feelings about a lost child, and the statement she made that she wanted Chris did not feel it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive making it seem uncaring toward the child's memory. Also, Jenny shows that they live in the house in a subservient role, as high society is being made to a member of the moment. <br /> <br /> Having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover (non-sexual kept with the more of the time) from 50 years ago, I was able to link with dilemmas Margaret and her husband. I also was dropped sideways because I was not good enough for her family, and on the rediscovery of mine on the internet, I was burdened and helped her cope with her experience still very terrible Vietnam and a wedding in a The woman was higher than anyone else she did not believe she liked. My husband, like the Margaret was very understanding, but the strain was very real. The lover was finally able to reconcile his real life situation with his fantasy in my only love. <br /> I thought it was a good decision to show a lot of reliving in the war experiences that happened to Chris's mind. I thought of "Mrs. Dalloway" and the WWI soldier who outlawed very violent souvenir and committed suicide against Chris's happy fantasy in Margaret. Conversely, the action of the soldier "Mrs. Dalloway" looks overwrought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to get their life back, but was it the right choice?
