I saw the last five or ten minutes of this movie back in 1998 or 1999 a night when I was channel-surfing before going to bed, and really loved what I saw. Since then, I have been on the lookout, revolting TV lists, flipping through DVD / VHS racks in stores, but did not get a copy until recently when I found out some internet stores selling it. And then being a world-class procrastinator, I still did not order it. Finally, I found a DVD copy at a City Circuit while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then he only took me about a month after returning home and watching him. So what do I think about the movie? It's good. It's not as good as I remembered and hoping for, but still well worth $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the movie all for the first time I rate it as a 7/10, and potential to become an 8/10. I will have less sleep then, and have a better sound system to avoid obtaining some dialogue.
