This film has a rotten core of flexible morality, and yet an original sense of justice. So many of the regular joes among us would like to "stick to the MAN". "MAN" in this case represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, who Carla reported in his office. After that, Paul must be the 70-year-old Mr. Marchand owner. Then there is the Word of Paul's Word. There seems to be a lot of questions about the history of this last character. Review shows it out as a weakness in a well-crafted ping-pong game between our two protagonists, scaling tit-for-pie until their lives change dramatically. Each MAN "MAN" is reinforced. One or both may be fired, killed, or imprisoned if they do not do as they say. The film has a sense of relief at the end. Carla finally came up. His boss was forced out for being a jerk. Mr. Club Owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. They get $ and $. And ... they do not need to worry about the report to the Officer's Officer, because his moral weakness led him to strip his wife's widow in the basement (or whatever police found he was arrested). It's a troubling critique trigger at the tumbler lock that wounds us up so tight. Never think that someone else can find Paul's record later supervised her release; for the moment they are free! They might even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They are stitched by the man!
