Jane Austen would definitely approve of this one! Gwyneth Paltrow makes a fearful job capturing the mood of Emma. It is funny without too funny, yet elegant. It puts on a very convincing British accent (not British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but it deceives me ... it was also excellent in "Sliding Doors" ... I sometimes forget it in American ~ !). <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother Emma Thompson) as the Bates women. They're almost robbed the show ... and Mrs. Law does not even have any lines! <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
