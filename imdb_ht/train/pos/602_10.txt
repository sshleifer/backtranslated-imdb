I never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel like this movie was perfect. The colors, how blatant dances were, the gypsum, and the rivals all put together have made a movie that seemed to have ended too early. I saw other movies from Carlos Saura and I agree that this film can be the best producer of it. I feel that the best features of his past film have been put together and lined to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras. While watching this film I felt I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortable watching the bang dancers on a wooden beam on a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I do not know how I will be able to get a copy of this film in the U.S. in the years to come. I recommend this movie to anyone who attracts middle-class culture. It's safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list.
