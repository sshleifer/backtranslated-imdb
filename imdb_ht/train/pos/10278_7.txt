"House of Games" is definitely not without its holes deformed, stubborn, final-stage but they do little to detect from the pleasure of watching a thriller that methodically releases to yourself. "House of Games" does almost everything a good idea is supposed to do. Of course, this is not a great feat to give the fact that we are dealing with the world of trust and their pitfalls. So it means that we never really know what's going on, even if we think we do. But this makes the movie worthwhile for those games; a movie that repeatedly looked at them indulgent rather than necessity. <br /> It has a definite Hitchcock slant in it.
