A beautiful movie, touching deeply up simple, but divine aspect of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and seen as nothing in this world can be really perfect, that's pretty good. The only thing my minor subjective object is, the rhythm of some point in the middle of the story. The act is also very good, with all the actors easy to actor head in high-profile film. The current direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script must have been amazing. There are some really breathtaking moments in the foreseeable, and a gorgeous way to continue the circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the main character realizes that the feeling of being in the sky is the perfect finish of a really brilliant wire.
