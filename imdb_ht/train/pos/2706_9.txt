I saw this film at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the movie. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought he would be his masterpiece - his triumph .You, if you take the movie seriously (like Mr Wood did) it is really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And this is cool. The big joke I got up early The day I died is that it does not even try to have a decent movie. <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The script is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely excellent. You see, this is either high art ... or garbage. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
