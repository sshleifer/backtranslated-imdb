Burlinson and Thornton provide an outstanding performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film, setting among one of the best I've ever seen. Horse races are absolutely fantastic !! Any horse-lovers out there will love this movie! <br /> <br />
