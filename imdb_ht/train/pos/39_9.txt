This is apparently one of Shemp's shorts and Stooges. (This excludes many vodav years with the team). But the distribution of comedy threesome is in it honed better here. Aside from the intense slapstick scenes, there are others more subtle, but just as funny. See Larry when Shemp asks her to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or look at the real object that pushes Moe's exclamation, "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is in his goofiest clutter. And the goon can look awesome, but it's somehow funny. It looks as frustrated and embarrassed with the Stooges as they are "regular" people in other shorts. <br /> For Shemp Airplanes, this is a must have episode. It will not disappoint.
