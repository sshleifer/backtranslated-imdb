I do not agree with anyone who might cancel this movie as "just" entertainment. Having a good time after 20s, during the early days of Depression, Depression, Dance, Folklore, Dance, is a heartbreak story of serious trials, with a clear message about how best to keep those hard times. But this film is fast-paced and tightly drawn away from being a sad moral story. In the 30s, Hollywood had a talent for churning out one entertaining * and * enthusiastic audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a frame of film. Dance, crazy, dance - one of the * films * * that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, yet his characters are well developed, his stories never seem to run, and despite his many twist of scheme, audience he never left behind. <br /> With the Lone exception of Lester Vail as lover love beloved Bob Townsend, the support cast is exactly strong. Most of the notes are William Bakewell as Brother Crawford, Cliff Edwards (best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in an early support role as Gangster Jake Luva. is Joan Crawford's movie, and it's absolutely bright in it. Made when it was just 27, this lesser-known version of Crawford will probably be unmistakable to people who are most familiar with later work. However, here is evidence that long before he took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a terrific and charisma actress carries a whole picture by himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
