Well, I just discovered that there is a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I love it! "League of Gentlemen" is a British medical comedy who is about the most terrible, crazy and disgusting cities throughout the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from the "Dive of Dibley" and "Papa Ted") looks pretty normal !! The format of the show is a lot like LITTLE Britain except that all of its centers around the townspeople in this hellish city. Both shows featuring the same sketches again and again every episode and some obviously inspired "Little Britain" (particularly the job seeking skit classes). But the show differs because although it is tiny as "Little Britain" (hence a show for kids), the show has a great quality and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all of these shows. In particular, animal and serial setbacks will renew the theme throughout the show. Now, if you have not guessed, this is NOT a show for kids, people are easy to quit or normal and that's probably why I love it. However, you really need very thick skin and a love of the terrible to enjoy this max. Funny and incredibly irreverent over belief - you have to see it in believing it.
