I'm far from a Stallone Sylvester fan and I guess the only time I really appreciate her appearance was in the French movie 3 cabin, which is almost nonexistent to the small role. But I must admit that this movie was actually not wrong, though I was scared the worst. <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of her friends and he plunges his death from a top head 4000, he can not possibly force himself to work as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he does not put a food in the spare but return it. Shortly after returning, a call from a hygienic group was trapped in a snowstorm. At least, this is the guards believe. In fact it is a thief group that crashed with the aircraft in the mountains after daring stolen plans can be full of money from a flying government aircraft failed. Can be dispersed all over the supply and need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them ... This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master idea and leader of the gang of thieves. I know her best in the TV series "The 3rd Stone from the Sun", but I enjoyed her performance in this film too. Overall the act is OK, it has a lot of action offered and of course also some one-covered materi, but it also offers a very nice decoration. This film was filmed in a beautiful natural setting. I loved snowy mountains and valleys, rivers and forests ... Maybe that's why I give this movie a higher score than I normally give a movie action / adventure to this type. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.
