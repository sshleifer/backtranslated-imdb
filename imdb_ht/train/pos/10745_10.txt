Let me get the bad out of the way first, James Hanlon is absolutely awful trying to act his description of what was going on with the rookie training and event of the day. Really it is in contrast to dealing with other fire fighters without acting aspirational in their delivery. <br /> <br /> That is said to be an amazing movie that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes. I am an English guy from London, but I love New York and I visited several times before and after September 11. It's a second home for me and I can not help, but feel devastated by the loss of life, but also the destruction of part of such an amazing city. This is the real deal, in with the fire fighters and everything falls around them. I'm so happy to have the foot to show people how it was on the day. It's a shame that they did not use any foot of people jumping out of the buildings because the friends who told me this is like the bigger part of the memories, it should include showing future generation come just as terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Theorist conspiracy can go to hell by the way.
