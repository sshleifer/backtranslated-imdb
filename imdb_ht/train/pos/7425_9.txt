Barbra Streisand is a journey of strength in this Hollywood story. Its performances and songs are one-of-a-kind and special in the halls of great movies. The scene where it is presented at the unexpecting audience by Kristopherson, against the crowd's willingness to read, only to turn around with her magnificent performance of "Woman of the Moon" is one of the best examples on the film as well a great sender can have an audience. It is real. The scene where it records evergreen ranks and the best of the business .. all live, no lip-five, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a diva, but it delivers on this one. It is majestic singing "with one more look at you ... It deserves the Oscar and Paul Williams got for Evergreen.Kristopherson had his moments too, far above most of his film's views. This is the "Fur" franchise to hang and the first one in 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March) although I will still enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason Renewal Music in 1954. I have not seen the DVD again and do not know about the kind read them.
