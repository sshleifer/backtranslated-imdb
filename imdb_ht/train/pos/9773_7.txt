The plot is real horrible, the atmosphere is really depressing, weird for a low-budget output like that, and at least for a German production. A little bit of American spirituality, mysterious thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of plots and characters are great, lying very close to reality, without any studio-atmosphere. It might be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a bit irritating, which is not inevitably having to be typically for low-budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) The cast is sometimes not much more than average. Almost every actor looked like a layman. Some of them do a good, or a very good job, but some act like the actors of independent German-show court! But I was very, very disappointed in acting in Mathieu Carri√®re! Acting her (in a lot of her older movies she acts good) here was under-average! But that would be the reason why it today takes part in soap phoning or TV series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound made it sometimes very difficult to understand, what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was happy to fly and listen to it again. It was caused by the series (large halls as in the hospital or the esoteric group) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> But all in all, it is an interesting movie, worth to look it, far behind commercial movies, which is often more terrible.
