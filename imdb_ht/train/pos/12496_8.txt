For years we've been watching every horror movie that comes out, from the Hollywood Morning Role like Saw 2, to terrible indie releases that are completely uneven ... we suffer from all bad films in hoping to find little gems like "Dark Stay". We managed to catch a screening of this movie in Shriekfest 2005. The audience liked it and I believe he finished win the award for the best movie. While it may not have the budget power or star in studio movie, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scary categories. The acting and cinematography are headache, but it's the direction that the movie is worth the look. The story and character developed at just the right speed provide some fantastic crises. <br /> <br /> Correct and visual fx are also top tooth. And while many horror films do not manage to use music in the benefits, the score for "dark stay" only adds to it's criticism. <br /> I know the movie has shown a bunch of festivals, but no being close to me, so I can not wait to hear when it will finally come out on DVD. Believe me, even if you are sick in the current state of horror movie, give this one to try ... you will not regret it!
