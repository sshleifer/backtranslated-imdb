Best show since Seinfeld. It's really funny. All her own feelings, hulking giants stoner the stallions, stallions of songs or cartoons, make this show in cooler on TV. One of the few shows I make the point of watching. The scene with old black womens in the pharmacy ("Oh wait now that you're locking you look old" turning face and finger and walking away from lol), the surdy sweating overdose, sleeping with God , it's all funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun. Show them weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn abnormal !! I really can not wait until the next show, something I did not feel for any show in a long time.
