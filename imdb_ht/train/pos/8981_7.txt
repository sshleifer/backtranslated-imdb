Dig! I would tell anyone even if you do not like Metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it's a spin-tap documentary on one of the largest groups in the world acting like mental childhood during a breakdown of quality. It's fun and fascinating. Together the same lines come to dig! A movie about 'The Dandy Warhol' and the 'Brian Jonestown' Massacre of Portland Bands that begin in a kind of music scene in the city only for one of the big stripes and one falls in the way of the music book story. Right from the start of the strips they pull in opposite directions just about their ability to make decisions whether good or bad. Filmed over seven years and at times painful to see us see the dandy's meteoric rise in fame (thanks to this vodafone announcement!) And Jonestown falls off from the instigator scene to the lucky whale scene. As the bandits become more friendly in the evening, tension and tension in the argument and even on stage scenes are stretched. All of this is half funny and half tragic and they believe it or not perversely look can. As I said at the beginning you can watch the Metallica movie though you have no interest in the group. Dig! On the other hand is a little different and it is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to look if you have a lot of interest in either band. Always a good movie and more a treaty must not be in a band than to encourage that as a career path. Dig! Is an angry ride on rocks and dress clothes queue and a fine example of the pitfalls and the pleasure they were or want to be famous.
