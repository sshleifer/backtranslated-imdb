Since the day I saw this movie when she came from 1981, she was one of my top 3 favorites. The blob I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary movie. <br /> <br /> The last credit in this movie explains its appeal - "Thank you for Manhattan people on whose island has been filmed." A romantic comedy and witty comedy, it is a love story written by New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) that can be identified everywhere (West 12th Street, Ansonia, former FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the whole joint thrown to click as well off-screen as they do about, and this intimacy is clearly communicating. I laughed, I called, it was better than CATS. Not only a song by Dorothy Stratten, it was also the latest appearance of Audrey Hepburn's (features a subsequent cameraman) and his inner beauty jumping out of the screen. Buy it, make a big popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.
