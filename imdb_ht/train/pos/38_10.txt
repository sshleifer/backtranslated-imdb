One of the best three Stooges shorts ever. A spooky home full of evil guys and "Goon" challenge the best men Adjust the Detective Agency. Shemp is in the top shape of the famous-in-the-scene scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in Mr. Goodrich it, as the target of a murder plot. Before it's over, the Shemp "trust little beads" is the work of great effect. This gem minute 16 moves on as fast as any Stooge's stamp and packs twice the box. Very recommended.
