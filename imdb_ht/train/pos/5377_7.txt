"Girls College Girls" is my first friend and the work written in Edgar Wallace ?? and generally my first real movie and movie "Crime" in general ?? and I can say that I'm moderately impressed. This is really fun, although I would never expect it to be so ?? so! The film has an exhilaratingly sad and nicely complicated, with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant twists and beautifully coined inventions. There are some types of James Bond in evil movemind ?? which always sits in the shade and before a great control - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls in a specific college and a new poison type. There is also a villainous monkey and a whip, dressed as a member of Communist KKK, to eliminate the rest of the characters, such as curious professionals and those, as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew earlier that these movie cinemas were so colorful and crazy, I would have bought a whole collection of them already. The british plot actually raises more questions than it responds to the end, and the sublimation of the funny gimmick on the account of the Scotland Backyard Inspector Higgins is sometimes a bit much to swallow but I do not care because it's sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60 band stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
