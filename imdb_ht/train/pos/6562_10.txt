Quite simply show the best facts ever to make. The first two seasons (those only matter) are about Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and do not like it. I guarantee you will end up watching the season. Then I guarantee that you will be watching Season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. The locations in Europe are awesome 3. Games are mentally difficult 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode a player responds to another player's despair, "I'm trying as hard as I can!" and an equally desperate, "Not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you know ... Who is the Mole?
