I do not agree with one of the reviews that compares this film to the American International Photo. Basil Deardon led a realistic british film and an honest attempt to show the rise of juvenile delinquency in the England postwar (but without sentimentality of Blackboard Jungle). The cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the estate in large real estate. The estate looked like an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective, reassigned to the juvenile division - "Urgent, urgent - Lunar - five lollies glaze" !!!! He finds it is butt in many jokes. David McCallum showed he was one of Britain's talented youth talents in fifty soldiers. (It had a very different role in another Stanley Baker movie "Hell Driver"). His painting of Johnny and his inspirational fans was very scary. Ann Heywood was also very good as Cathy's cynical. I would not say that there was a romantic subplot in it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. As he finds evidence that could lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the Division Division - it is very disgusting to what he feels is not proper police work. Among all excellent she got his first call out - 6 year old Murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly boutiques !!! <br /> Take the twins home to meet the brothers, Johnny's charismatic, and Cathie embrace the sisters. It starts to appreciate how life on hideous housing estates can turn youngsters into criminals. As he becomes more involved in the family, he has a strong link between the fires, Johnny and a young Chinese scary who works for a laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing in a normal role, away from the Hammer Terror) explains that when Johnny was younger he saved some people from a burning building and considered a hero. He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and was helpful and felt he could not fire fire. The film was besieged in a very real way and the viewer felt the fear of the kids - the teacher (thinking only in its own safety) ran with the locks in the room with the awesome weapon !!!! /> I thought it was a really excellent movie that tried to show some of the UK's most experienced issues after the war. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
