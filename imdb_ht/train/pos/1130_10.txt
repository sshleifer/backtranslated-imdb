'Iphigenia' is a great success in Michael Cacoyannis. This mastery play is mastery suited to the screen and brings to life not a wonderful throw. Cacoyannis realize the impossible. He manages the film of a Greek screen tragedy without losing its effectiveness and importance. An extensive gold dispenser helps him in this. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is very impressive as Iphigenia. Just as impressive is Irene Papas, who, though it sometimes looks to the top, is very realistic. A beautiful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis who is ideal in every stage. Rumors say that the movie loses Oscar's best foreign movie language not only 1 vote!
