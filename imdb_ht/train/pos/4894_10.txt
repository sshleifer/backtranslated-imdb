I grew up during the time that the music of this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was a little too small to go to the USO and box. Guess it sounds like I'm living in the past, (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with that? !! Second War 2 was a terrible time, except where music was concerned. Death Glenn Miller was a sad one for us. This movie will be a favorite of me. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I've ever missed this movie. My main reason for this is the moderation of the modern generation of an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
