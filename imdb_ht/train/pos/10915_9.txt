RKO studio decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of the biggest budget efforts in cash on the popularity of the Thing Man. They have succeeded in some degree. <br /> A lot of folks forget that in addition to and sooner than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played a few Philo Vance films in the title role. So, at that time it was very well put into the role. Dr. Bradford does not make much lunch as Nick Charles, but Nick's nuclear core is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles is married to a heiress, Dr. Bradford works for a living as a doctor. This helps in his dedication to detective and in fact he does this in this movie. <br /> It has two killers to solve. A jockey falls on a horse coming to the homestretch in a big race and dying for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something affects, but it was knocked off by the more conventional method in a bullet. This is after coming to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a steady influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays it as more of a dude dude than Loy did. But she works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Evergreen James Gleason is the police inspector of the Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton Role. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore as the chief of the campbell Powell explained this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur signed into this studio, we could see a whole kill in Bradford movie.
