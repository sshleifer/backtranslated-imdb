and this is a very disturbing film. I can be wrong, but this is the last movie where I consider Burt Reynolds a current actor, who transforms the role, and delivers a message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They do not regret and do not know; Businessmen want to enjoy the country. Little did know what would happen next. The photography and lay them are realistic and natural. This was before the days of Wes Craven. What's more disturbing about this movie is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, popular lands still detest those cities; it is almost a century and a half since the Civil War. <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in rural areas in South Georgia, which still exists. Just do not drive past Mobile, Alabama; This area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
