Did you see the previous two trilogy in Bourne movies, I was a little hesitant to watch the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> However it was a very thrilling experience and I did not have the problem of not understanding what had happened because of the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with the Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I do not think I've ever looked like an exotic made, and gripping film, especially a movie action. Since I usually shy away from stocks and movie movies, this was like my great news. Ultimatum is one of the most fun films, it attracts your attention from the first second until the last minutes before the credit roll. Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard many of her great performances at Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this fabulous actress has one more add to her list. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts are busy with style - each made brilliant and I was just shocked by the impressive movie. Well done.
