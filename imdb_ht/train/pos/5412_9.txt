As a Pokémon fan I enjoyed this movie very much. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (like every movie performed) and adds depth to the relationship between its characters. I do not expect non-Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this includes most adults). Some of the lines were real, but that may be somewhat inevitable when lining the movie over English. The animation was beautiful, although there was a couple party that did not look good. And although the villain is kind of shark, I think movies have done a great job of riding bikes in different types of villains, and I guarantee you are not all like this one. People who did not like it, I tell each of his own, but Pokémon fans will love it.
