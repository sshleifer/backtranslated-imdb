I enjoyed this movie many.Tobey Maguire provided a terrific performance as Jake. It has to be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised there were many funny lines in the movie. He was very good at this too although I never saw him deliver a comic line before. The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is coming to them all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think he did rather well. Many interesting scenes. A good good ride. I'm absolutely a fan of the Maguire. Check out the House Cider Policy. One of the best ever.
