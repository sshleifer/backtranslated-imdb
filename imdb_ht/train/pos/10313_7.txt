China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Harvest Harvest production was eliminated by director Robert Clouse veteran. Unfortunately he was either lucky and enters the dragon or he was losing his touch because he is not great at a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it could be a classic action instead of a smash right-to-video action sticker. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help out her father. He has problems with the local crowd and needs his help. So it returns home and restores order (with the help of two easy people). But will they be enough to reverse Big Mister and his evil companions? <br /> If you are a great Cynthia Rothrock fan then the movie catered for you. I only enjoyed the battle scenes, everything else is garbage. Why did not Raymond Chow shell out a few pieces and hire a top dentist? Recommended.
