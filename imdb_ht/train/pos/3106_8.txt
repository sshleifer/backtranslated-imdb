Did you not see these films in front of (and they can not stand Matt Damon), I hesitated to go to Bourne Ultimatum when we asked to see it for AS Film Studies. <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon would be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Fast scene battle, crazy motorcycle chases and big explosions that have been thrown out of your chair at TBU. Lacking close between the CIA and the burrows kept on your toes and saddened entreaties. But many things really grate my cheese. First, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence received repetition and finally dull. Although Damon kept us entertained and seemed always a step ahead of the CIA, I got a bit annoyed with the constant survivor of Bourne. He crashed a car and came out as if he was tapping it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so unstable it was completely apparent and made to me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even teachers) seasick. We have said that the teachers said that if we ever used that in a movie we did in class, it would automatically be wrong and we should say to use a tripod. Fair enough if greengrass wanted it look like we had to look Damon and Stiles hold a conversation, but surely we should not shake ourselves violent! <br /> But all of TBU is an enjoyable movie and worth a look. But I did not think it was the best movie of the year, despite being a fun piece of movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
