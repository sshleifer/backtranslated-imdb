Then I read that at least two of the cast members spent on them and I must say, I know it probably would not really see Lars von Trier's vision, but I would be happy to watch actors to replace past just To see, it's hard to find someone to play Helmer as the worthy character Helmer, the doctor you love hated! I think I have yet to see a more self-absorbed, subconscious, self-righteous on screen! But I could neglect a change of actor .... I just need to know how it ends!
