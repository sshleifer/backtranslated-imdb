It is so enjoyable to see one big piece of art converted into another without distortion or constraint. I had no guess how to be such an extraordinary piece of literature that would recreate as a worth seeing movie. If you liked Bulgakov's books you would understand, frightening to see some misguided interpretations do more for the sake of an art-movie project than to actually carry the deep meaning of the story on the screen. There is a couple example of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. It is as if the cinema reads Bulgakov as a conductor orchestrated a score - and not a missed score. Why can not these talents be found in the United States? So now my favorite books and films have the same title.
