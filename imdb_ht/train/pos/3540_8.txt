I bought this game about a purchase pulsing at Walmart. I'm glad I did. It was very fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels were very difficult! One sniper I thought was too difficult, he made me so frustrated I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people who shot at you nothing to hide behind or to handle it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I did not notice any difference in equipment upgraded to the upgraded, such as buying an upgrade weapon did not seem to make the gun more or more complete on my life meter. I really liked Copter's Q. I think the developers did a great job.
