I just read the lead comment for this movie which is on the front page with the results cast and dropping running down. <br /> <br /> Why is it that some people can not take a movie for what it supposed to be This film is supposed to be an exciting light, pigeon tone, family comedy, stuff for kids and things for adults, and that's exactly what this film does. /> <br /> I laughed black out of this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance with the entire movie (if look at Christmas) really gives you a bit of festive festivities <br /> So, in all of you movie reviews stop trying to sound like movie students and hit each movie because it is not "taxi driver" or "the Godfather" and take the movie for what they are supposed to be, entertainment !!
