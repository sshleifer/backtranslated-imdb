No hidden agenda. More exact. All fun. <br /> I saw the original on TV and was awesome pretty bad. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> You can one original appreciate more when compared to the new one that I saw and forgotten. The original one, starring Steve McQueen's big star (BULLET), is not far from the best version and only anyone should see. <br /> <br /> The movie production has date, but the FX uses to make the popping up the test in time. I was convinced that things were moving on its own accord. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
