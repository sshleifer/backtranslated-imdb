I saw this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's always great every time I see it. It is a very compelling version of Carmen's opera, with amazing flamenco dancing, busting, and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story of a story, with each other parallel, until sleep is over to the tragic. Obviously a Spanish low-yield production, the film has been danced by some of the first Spanish flamenco dancers. The combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancer boots on the wooden scene, to tell the story is even more powerful. <br /> It's independent movie making it its best and probably my favorite movie alien forever.
