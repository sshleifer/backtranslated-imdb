Well, so there is a front in front of a checker taxi, probably late 1930's model. It has large triangular shaped lights. There is also a Cab DeSoto in this black and white, driving characters, almost a love music goes wrong history. <br /> <br /> The real fun here is to look at the 1940s interiors room with templates and hotel elevators. The hair styles, men and women are gorgeous. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair it could make it great. There is an art gallery that would be jealous of every Andy Warhol. If you look this waiting a nice casablanca scenario or sound in the music, you'll be disappointed. There is a nice little story under the approach of the runway model of this movie. <br /> <br /> My copy on DVD and another movie for $ 1 was pretty visible. The title sequence was beautiful, but not the upset and upset, angry, mad, mad world or Pink Panther. This was a RKO film but did not have the beautiful plane logo that RKO used to use. <br /> I loved Victor Mature in a million, B.C., and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday. Look if you can find that one. It was wonderful in the comedy and Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or after the Fox. Richard Carlson went on to lead three live TVs in the early 1950s. VicBar /> Vic Mature has offered Sampson's father to renew the Sampson and Delilah. He should have wondered if he had any problems playing the part of the dad since he was well known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is good, I'll play mom Sampson." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
