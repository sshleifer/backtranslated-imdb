Now I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Akshay Kumar and John Abraham were brilliant actors, I think after watching this film they should make many more movies together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets herself in a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way she is busy at someone from the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch, she really acts well his movie and i hope he does the biggest comedy as this one of the future Jan Abraham plays his best friend and plays his role really Well and it is so annoying I'm glad that some of her amazing works have noticed but she's a really good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good I really recommend this movie to everyone.
