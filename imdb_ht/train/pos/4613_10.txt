This movie has one of the cheesiest plot I've seen. For me, that's what makes it so awesome! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieve in the original Munsters series. While there were less slapstick, they always worked wonderfully together "comedy." I wish Yvonne De Carlo, as Lily, would have been more involved in drawing. He showed he could comedy into the original series, but he was mostly wasting the movie. This film is also the great star of South Caesar, but sadly, she has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think some better jobs could come from that.
