Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic-Broadway Village I could not wait to see it in the final copy .. See this movie in Cleveland's premiere last Friday, I was not laughing loudly in a comedy in a long time! It's a great slapstick. Russo's brothers did a great job. Throw at all doing the best comedy acting ... No segment that's not easy or dry ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and it's great as the safer breaker safely in this flick movie. I was most impressed by William H. Macy as stealing "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" to keep you in "stitches". I believe they have the funniest roles of the whole movie.
