As a popular sport, navigation was loved by many. Just after viewing the documentary, I realized how dangerous she might be. In fact surfers are also scared of huge waves. Even a person was killed by him. But they always keep on surfing and enjoy themselves. Only the brave can do it. <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came to them. You have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strikes of the huge wave. When you have it, that will obviously bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The amazing kimera can not be neglected. This is absolutely visual. <br /> An excellent documentary. 8/10
