The first time I came to Delirious, I only heard her. I listened to all comedy performance and I never laughed much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and make great imitation is fascinating. When I finally came to see her act, I had her. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious her engineering show! With the new millennium, his act in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then. My parents love it as adolescent and I (age eighteen) love it as well. From that point, I saw other Murphy movies coming in America and Harare Harlem. There will be no other comedy like Eddie.
