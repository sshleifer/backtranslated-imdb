I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters faced with the fact of having a powerful creature among them. The gorilla looks just terrific, and the eyes are especially lively. It's even a little scary at times and should have the kids a little scary without going over the head. Rene Russo plays her role feminine role. Usually those types of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a bad-straw man but the only opponent is the Gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are people, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can not treat them just as people because they are not. Not many corporate films in this territory and it is worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-like similarity.
