Respect the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing a weak day with several other dance, one a duo and a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing these essentially "scenes" dance in a pure form than in her film and generation Rogers, and before she learned how to take full advantage of the potential of films. Best of all: The fact that we see burns and allen before radio / television husband and wife comedy actress, performing dancing types to be made in vaudeville and did not have a chance to make in the Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a dance instructor). The two numbers with Fred are high points in the movie, and worth waiting for. The First Trio Soft Shoe is a heat-up for the "Chin Up" exhilarating carnival number, in which three of them sing and dance in the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fred Astaire's fans and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing under the "plot". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and get the fast forward button.
