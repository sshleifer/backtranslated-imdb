Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing talent to accentuate, and she shows incredible skills in this film in general. I really felt it when Lindy was persecuted. He played realistically, too. It became angry, upset, and unpleasant as the media and the government continued to relentlessly witchhunt. I did not expect much from the movie initially, but I really was interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It turned out better than I was anticipating. Sam Neill was also exceptional; This is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really loved him in other movies (the piano, for example). I gave the movie a 7, but if I could just rate the act, I'd give it a 9.5, and a 10 perfect for Streep.
