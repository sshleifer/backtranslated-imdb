In general, I agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel that I should not even comment since it is a lot the movie veterinarian and I'm not a vet (I was a resident). The defect is that Mat is poorly underdeveloped and does not act. I guess that Stephen Metcalfe is a vet himself and has spent too little time planning on his character.
