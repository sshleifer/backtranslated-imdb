I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big movie screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was pleased to see this movie still playing in an important movie in Leicester Square, London, after having won the Academy Award for Best Photos of the Year before. The success of "Oliver!" On both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent starts on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary legend by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English speakers, was admirable to lead in London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His good music then became a hit in New York and all over the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. along with the music mind boggling ideas. The song "Who will buy?" Requires hundreds of actors and British filmmakers to really deserve their Oscar to put it together in a seamless way. Some Canadian and American talent is also part of this wonderful production, but especially it is a tribute to the fine profession in the British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good show! Other films in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Brave, Denham, and Ealing have also given the world many films of treasures over the years.
