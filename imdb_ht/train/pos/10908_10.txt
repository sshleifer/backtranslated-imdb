I could not keep tears when I looked at this beautiful documentary. It was heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, something will make you think. You look as John lives in the last couple of months in his life. You look as he goes on his day with a positive attitude. At one point you start to see that it's really an amazing person. You begin to understand that it has something to teach you all. Her life and struggle will make you cry, laugh, and find that life is a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time.
