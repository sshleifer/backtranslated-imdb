This was a very daring movie for her day. It could even be described as soft-core pornography for the silent era. It was a talkie, but Dialogue was very limited, and in German. One did not need it anyway. Youth (19) Hedy Lamarr gets trapped in an unusual marriage to an obsession (stereotype?) German and after a while in a marriage that was apparently never consommated, returning home to his father. <br /> In a famous and funny scene, she decides to go thirsty to dip one morning when her horse is distracted by another. He is then forced to run through a field chasing him, as he left his coat on the horse. An engineer retrieves his horse and returns his clothes - after receiving an eyeful. <br /> They sit for a while, and, at a zen moment, he presents it with a flower and a bee sitting on top. This is where he thinks back to his honey and the actions of her husband and a bug. He knows that this man is different. <br /> She returns home and eventually seeks our young companions, and finds the excavation she refused. You can use your imagination here, but itself disappears from view and we see it just with pleasure. Since it has never been stripped, you can imagine ... Certainly, a homage to women by director Gustav Machat√Ω, with a 1933 hearing. <br /> <br /> The only thing that marsh this film very well filmed is too much guilt, and a strange ending.
