Bob Clampett 'A Itch in Time' milks seven minutes in crazy action from a very small site. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches his head just another time more he will provide a daunting bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless illness makes it all but impossible to stop from scratch. The design changes between the weight gain inside the dog's fur and the desperate attempt to deal with it. In a great sequence that really captures frustration in a non-scratching spine, the dog changes color from the red blue brown to polka packed plaid! It sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly reminds the indescribable feeling of a pyas in a way that Clampett could. There are several other elements that make 'Best Hip' in Clampett. Has the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the munching flea on the dog's body. There is the frantic violence that spears itself in any scene featuring the cat. Most notably, there are dirty jokes that include a huge back shot that causes the bug in wild-whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch his head by pulling him behind the floor. It's time to break into the audience: "Hey, I'm best off this out. I can find her love"! With a very limited concert, Clampett managed to make 'A Itch in Time' a unique, minitiae-based cartoon. Like an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'A Itch in Time' is practically anything but very funny with it.
