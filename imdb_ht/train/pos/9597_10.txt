This is a documentary film-be seen for anyone who is fearing modern youth who lost his taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality. Darius Goes West is a roller coaster star in a story. We live Darius life and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime. Darius has Duchenne metastatic dystrophy, a disorder that affects all the muscles in his body. He is imprisoned in a wheelchair, and he needs attention clocks. So how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take it on a thousand 6000 miles-trip to the west coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great-smile adventure and weeping with the crew as they face unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town at a refreshing reception and some great surprises!
