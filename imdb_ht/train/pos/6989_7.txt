This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I saw this film, I did not think about wonderful TV series. I believe this was a superb 40's supreme cinema in the movie, with very amazing sounds and photos for a 67 year old movie supporting public domain. I actually liked watching Bela Lugosi and his rude staff, including his wife who asked for the fluids of the gland-bride to be a bride, an old, and her unkind son, one giant idiot, the other a dwarf funny (Angelo Rossitto from Freaks 1932). I also enjoyed the reverend young reporter, who is kind of a stereotyped, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this movie otherwise decent is it's drawn, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I do not want to spoil any of this movie, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.
