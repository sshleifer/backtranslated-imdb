You know the story - a group of no-hopper enters into a seemingly no competition to win - it's a story that made to death by Hollywood (bring it on, the Karate Kid, the Escape Victory, Best of Best etc). Now Korea gives it a go with a Taekwondo team with great difficulty ?? and guess what ?? The result is predictable, but ultimately satisfied. <br /> The fact that this movie does not fall flat on its face is down to the young talent cast that really cares about the characters, and this in turn keeps you looking at the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of typical typical martial arts or art can be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual batch of movement and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu film; The limited action (albeit impressive) kicking off and occasional punch. This is not important though, since it is the interaction of characters and fights to do something in the head that makes this movie a success.
