Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and late Morrow late are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers on his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow all turn their first performance into their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has a little less than job privileges in trying to spice up a movie-made-for-TV movie (twenty-five years ago), by providing "sex interest" to an otherwise unknown movie. The real star, however, is the California Kid; a couple 1934 Ford, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, put forward a camera and provided a workout that will let the slider viewer, gasping and hold the corner of the chair and anticipate without. The scenes are spectacular, although some of the dialogue are a bit lame to do for a fine evening rehabilitation. This is how all "car movies" should be done. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.
