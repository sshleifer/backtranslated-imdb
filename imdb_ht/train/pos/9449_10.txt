I watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when I should have been asleep. This, in itself, was the testimony that the Passover was a spell-binding film. I think Boorman did a great job on directing this movie. How to experiment the early and popular scenes of hills and banjos are dueling. It showed that well and early on how naturally reserved and simple people in the area were. At the point - near the end of the "duel", the boy bandjo-playing smiles (likes Banjo it), but when Drew tried to shake the boy after the "duel", the kid was too reserved answer. The river trip never leaves you bored, for sure. The scene of rape was brutal, but it was necessary to show just what the group was waging against in Bakwood this area of ​​Georgia. I think that Beatty's traumatic trauma afterwards was well done. Some said it was very affected by the ordeal. I do not agree - if you really pay attention, he respected throughout the action immediately after, in which Reynolds put the arrow in the attacker and chased the guy toothless. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. It almost seemed to be the arrow while Ed was reeling up and waiting to die, but then you realize the arrow he shot earlier was finally taking effect. <br /> In any way, a big movie, and I was on a vote between 8 and 9 in my vote, but after reading a message from a voter who did not want to give it a "1" , I gave him a "10". This individual reasoning seemed to be based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlative attempt to lower the rating.
