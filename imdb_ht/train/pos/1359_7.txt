I work in a library and hope to love this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I love Parker Posey a lot (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really nice as her boyfriend (she could not act but when you look like he cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny or beautiful or much of anything. Posey has kept the movie afloat and its energy. But he learned the Dewey Dezimal system OVERNIGHT and then tons of tons of books beaten in music ?? !!!! ??? Come! Also, I had a problem with how he looked when he became a full-fledged librarian at the end of the hair - a pen, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let this stereotype go please? Worth sees for Posey and Townsend but that's about it. TV series was the best.
