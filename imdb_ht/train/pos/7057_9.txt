As an adult I really enjoyed this one. I watched her with my 2 daughter and 3 1/2 year old in fascinating and 15 months old giggled in the mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. The end of this did not return to Neverland. A good follow-up of the Cinderella story; but what gets in Drusilla? Another end? I hope that!
