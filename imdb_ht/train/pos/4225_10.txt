Ruth Gordon is one of the most sympathetic killers that Columbo has ever faced. And the plot is inventive all the way around. This is one of the best Kolumbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their support role. And Peter Falk delivers a little something extra in his scene with Gordon.
