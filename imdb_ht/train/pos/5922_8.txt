I found this movie to be interesting right from the start - like a Spielberg movie - and found the plot to be intriguing as I tried to figure out what the current situation was. Start - before the opening credits - the action begins, bringing with it immediate suspension. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are very likable. (I have problems with any of the Baldwins, due to Alec's extracurricula activities, political activity, but William was not too bad in this movie.) <br /> There were several very unexpected twists, which contributed to enjoyment. <br /> There was, unfortunately, many places that had an annoying high high sound in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone was picking video monitors on the set.
