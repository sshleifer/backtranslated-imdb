I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact I very much want to have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, filmmaker, took less than a month in film and spent about EUR 1 million for this film. This proves that not only great productions make big movies. The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language BUG means program errors that cause reactions in computer functions. Reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. These vigilant things in this movie begin with the death of a donkey. One man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road ... From the ivan everything becomes complicated ... <br /> I point to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who can not do everything right at all.
