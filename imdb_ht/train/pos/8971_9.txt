Generally, I'm not a big fan of film motion stop and the first RUKA did not take my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in the Czechoslovak repressive during the Soviet-era domination, the more I watched the movie, the more I realized just how subversive this innocent looking little movie was. This subtext really made the movie come to life and gives it real power to stay as both a work of art and a political statement. The sad movie is done without any dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's going on. A lovely little wooden man is making a clay skin and has a nice time when suddenly an invigorating meddling but appearing and destroying the skin - doing it in a sculpture but instead. Well, the wooden man trying again and again chasing the hand and doing his own thing. However, over time the hand becomes more and more stressed and eventually the man's cage. And, in the end, this man is thankful to die but does not despise the hand, in a real hypocrisy, to the hero's hero's funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his domineering government. No wonder even though the Czechs loved the movie and praised the criticism, the state (that is, the hand) banned this little story. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberating a little more than two decades later while co-known as the "Velvet Revolution".
