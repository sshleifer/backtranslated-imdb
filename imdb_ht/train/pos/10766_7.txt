A thin story with lots of fine shots. Eyecatchers here are three ladies from D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanies them. Traci Master convincingly acts out half of the women in a bad business-couple who intends to poison the world and entrapment. Original to this film is the arm-bomb, putting on a captured member of the D.R.E.A.M.M.-team. Of course it is delivered by a co-member, three seconds before explosion. Although clearly lent to James Bond's Goldfinger and 'You only live twice', such a major point still works well. All in all a nice look, James Bond replaces here by the three Charlie Angels.
