John Waters has done most effectively dynamic, sincere, obscure, personal little movie I think I've ever seen (quite possibly fast Fast Food Women coming to second close) Vision director is untainted ... The narrative is capricious, the characters are The personal and odd reflection of the family and its own inner life ... the tone is never forced or stylistically on-vault. There is no spring pump design, annex, or standings. Plimpton mat is amazing as the sister .Eddie furlong is inspired to drop off. A grandmother with a pale Mary, sweated, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage becomes art today - and the lesson of the movie is that the most important thing we can value is family ... with a humble life.
