It is often only after last year that we can look back and see those stars that really stars. As this French movie critic, whose name rescues me, said: "There is no Garbo ... no Dietrich, and there, thanks heaven!" Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European leaders. , it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not, the first French talkie, to track a script written by Renowned Ren√© Clair, to report that they ended (the direction, that is) by Georg Pabst, and for the incorporation of the voice of Edith Piaf before he was well known! So many talent working on and in a movie, how could not it turn out to be a masterpiece? And that's the movie It's a shame to Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when he returned to the United States - many talent thrown so awogantly by the way! In the movie, in addition to getting to look Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see photos in Paris about 1930 and heard the voice of the young Piaf. I never get tired of this movie!
