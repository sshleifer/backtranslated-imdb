Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since the Truman Show, and was a nice surprise after some of his latest "Hey Hollywood - look how good I can act!" box office deception. It's great to see Jim acknowledge and deepen his strength. He will not get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the "films provided" of the Academy. She is in the shape of her most recent film - is like returning to an old friend. Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all make a great work together - comfortable in the role of comedians, superb comic distributions, and obviously having fun together but without "Hey Mom - look how funny I am" kind of comedy. A real surprise was Steven Carrell as the Carrey Nemesis (Carrell of the Daily Show Fame), which was walking away with some of the best and funniest movies in the movie. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else over the past three years. <br /> I can predict black religious in the U.S. will be up-in-arms on the treatment of God, but the bottom line of film is true to all theological theological theory - we are the mass of protoplasms trying to get into life short we do not exercise our free will. Without getting married to children, complaining about it will likely be a target of people who have the priorities (who know their qualities - people are decorated in gold ranges on Sunday and TV near the door, selling prayers to God). And, again, about 0.5% of the country cares and 80% of the media is reporting it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is a fun funny movie, every laughing audience asked what they would do, with a feeling-good feeling of film conclusions. A walk down any major street in America has confirmed that God has a lot of sense of humor. What better comic genius reminds us than Jim brings. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - it's GREAT to have you back!
