The rookie kept me smiling from the beginning to the end. Dennis Quaid played the role of perfection. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. He did this a movie father-son to remember. Messages are good people. Follow your dreams. The flaw in the pursuit is OK as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.
