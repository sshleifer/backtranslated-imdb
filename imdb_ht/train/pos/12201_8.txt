Made in 1946 and released in 1948, the lady and Shanghai were one of the great films performed by Welles after returning from relocation to Kane Citizens. Black, grooming and expressing some early French paranoia, this film stands high as a film-Noir film. The film is full of features of Welles' features of odd angles, quick cuts, long boilers and disaster lighting. Using Ambient Music Music is a precursor to the incredible loss of opening loss of the Touch of Evil, and the Chinese mysterious characters and sequences of Chinatown can only be considered as inspiration, in many ways, the Chinatown Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, it's Welles's obsession with the film movie that hurts this movie completely. Draws this story often over after a sometimes incomprehensible chaos in film techniques. However, despite this criticism, the story combines with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) to make this movie a happy look. Orson Welles pulls off not only the Irish brogue, but their identity is torn like the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks down with her usual role as a gender goddess and takes on a real depth of contradiction and contradiction. Finally, Glenn Anders's amazingly painfully painted or husband's husband Elsa's husband is nothing short of classical!
