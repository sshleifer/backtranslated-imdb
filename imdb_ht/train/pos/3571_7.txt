I saw this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. This one would be a cult fave! The best line, "Your clothes are deep cool!" says the Prince of Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines as the stepmother. I also liked the 1950s cars and motorcycles. The sadness Prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. She tries to stay cool but neglecting her love for her princess-to-do story. His shoe is not glass (faster in the original story), but Cinderella loses is still, but gets it back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it does not show more and seems to be almost impossible to find. Hopefully blockbuster or Amazon will start to give this one sometime soon.
