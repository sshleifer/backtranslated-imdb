Antonioni was aiming for another hip, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than "blow up". It has not been successful with critics and teens like the former though. Why? Perhaps because it was a European view of America filled with clich√©s that did not work then and have no age well. (Revolutionary students at the beginning are embarrassing.) Perhaps when it was released, large blockbuster blockbuster and those specifically targeted at the young market seemed dated. If it was released a year before perhaps hippies in desert might seem cool ... It's very interesting movies, very nice shot and some brilliant scenes with Antonionian in between, like the love-making of the desert, the silence of the castle Desert and the explosive end ... These drives were not amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Freshette brand is a little better than Daria Halprin. It would be so much better with proper actors! Perhaps Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and intense at times, that you would not know the way the lines will deliver ... <br /> A very interesting document in the sixties Delays are definitely worth a look for the photography and the band.
