Wow, I forgot how big this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking in the garage. It is a kind of unusual combination of a bio of Michael Jackson, a collection of music stickers, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some toddlers. The bad stickers (especially Speed ​​Demons), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as strange as it son). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has plenty of cool imagery and great music to entertain at all! The real gem however is the incredible "Smiley Criminal" video, making the movie worthy of ownership for this alone!
