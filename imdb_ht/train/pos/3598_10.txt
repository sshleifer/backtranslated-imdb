Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies, feels only focused on the boxing and not the characters themselves, this film really moved me. I liked being able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going to many of these for a while, it was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodriguez) made such a beautiful Diana play work especially since this was her first experiment, she has shown true emotions and describes beautiful Diana. All actors were chemistry on the screens and made this movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
