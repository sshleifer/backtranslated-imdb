A hideous, thrilling comedy, this. David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes is a successful, professional couple, reader, reader, photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and, in a compromise, Mulder agrees to move on to the condition that, along the way, visiting sites of historical interest regarding famous famous assassins. His ideas: He writes the words, takes pictures, and results in the end of a coffee bar pizza that will put them up for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share cars and claim the reality. As the bad luck would have Brad Pitt see the ad and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet the writer couple and start their trek. Inevitably, alas happened ... Pitt is outstanding as Grace Gray's truly frustrated inspiration and ability was backed up by Lewis playing his usual garbage character that seems to be his default setting. Duchovny and Forbes make for a convincing double act too, and, as spiral events out of control, you as the viewer are sucked into their combat and can feel the rattening tension. <br /> <br /> Clever, disaster and nice shot, this worthy recognition exceeds its current status. A top movie.
