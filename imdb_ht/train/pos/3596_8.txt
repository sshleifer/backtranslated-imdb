I finally sat down and saw this film all the way, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my favorite new actors --- it's not just the fact that she * may * act, but that she chooses the best roles that are more meaningful and important than her first look. I have read some comments expressing relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She followed her dreams and believed herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinking (with the exception of her younger brother and her coach and manager, Hector, who proved to be more of a father's face than her real parents), that is what the word "feminism" is all about. It is good to see movies like this showcasing the true side of feminism - that are not a bunch of lost temples - but that they have dreams and can do nothing. Diana is true of herself while still falling love outlet, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and put some faith back to my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie that's relatable not just young women, but everyone wants to go far into their lives.
