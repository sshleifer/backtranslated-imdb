I am sure you would like to see a resurrection in a set of dates dating with the technology they have today to bring back the excitement of kid to me. I grew up on black and white television with Seahunt and Gunsmoke my weekly weekly. You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt. We need a change in TV speed and this would work for a world of underwater adventure.Oh the way to thank you for a grip like this view many views on television and many movies. So any way I think I had what I mean. would be nice to read some more more about sea hunting. If my rhyme should be 10 lines you would let me submit, or let me be in doubt and let me quit, if this is so then, I have to go so lets do it.
