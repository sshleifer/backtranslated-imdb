I remember seeing this movie showed several years ago on the long lifetime television network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I saw her again and fell on the heels of love with this movie. The story behind the movie is the fascinating and in itself. The cast just makes it much more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of his game in this picture. She's Mrs. Chamberlain's nail styling, the accent, and even look. She shows the pain, sore, surprise, and anger Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember that it's not Lindy. In my opinion, this performance in Meryl was better than turning Oscar-winning into the "Sophie's Choice", and should have won her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some reason surprised, was not recognized by the Academy and at least one nomination. In all, this movie receives only one Oscar (Streep's for Best Comedy.) However, she has received several Australian and nominal Oscars. <br /> <br /> Definitely a top-rate film: it tells a great story and you get great performance from the entire cast.
