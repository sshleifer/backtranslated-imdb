I've just seen this movie for the first time ever and I love it. His dance was very fun. I read somewhere that she got the part of this movie because she knew how to dance. The landscape also had a lot. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laugh at the funny kiss scenes, but that's what's great about old movies! I grew up with him on the Munsters and I enjoy watching him in his earliest movies. They may not all be the best out there but are always worth watching to see his acts and songs. I slowly buy all his films and watch them as I get them. I have a great collection of her memories.
