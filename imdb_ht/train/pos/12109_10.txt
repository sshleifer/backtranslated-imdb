Love !! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! It has been shown in our country just recently in TV Heroes and CBNs every 5:30. It is about Azuma Kazuma who tries to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works at South Toyo's Pantasia branch and he also helps his friends (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakeries (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight with other skilled bakery in many other countries and not only learn to make different types of cakes but also learn to cook other. It's a really funny and unique anime because they also character imitate from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and one piece) and most famous people in real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must-see for people of different ages.
