I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. Her music, dancing her .. It was and she is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a present .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again .. After a lot of years, and he chased me back in time. I almost call. Not because of Michael Jackson, but in the good old times I remembered back than when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The movie gave me some other perspectives back then when I was a kid. You can really see the parody that Michael went to his life. Thanks to Michael Jackson bring me back in these great times, to your great music and dance. It's a shame that people forget you .. I did not because You gave me great moments with your music .. All the best of you ever You are out there ..
