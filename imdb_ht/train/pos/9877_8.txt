<br /> Featuring Lily Mars is one of a genre of films that sadly seem to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now that you know my bias, here are some reasons I think this movie stands out. <br /> 1. Despite the basic draw - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star, and win the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a very Hollywood stock history of the period, the writers varying terms in it a bit more than normal. Although Lily gets big crush when the star leaves, he is not successful and has swallowed his pride and returned to play a minor role in the show. Judy Garland (enough to say!) <br /> 3. Throw in support includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is pretty much beautiful, as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The superior performance performer even though attending actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a single actress turned to guardian theater. <br /> <br /> Worth a look for sure. One of these movies is designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
