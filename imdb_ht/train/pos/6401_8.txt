Honor man has many aspects of it. Good action sequences, many of the "feel good" scenes, a good note of music, but parts that really make the movie are great acting. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The Story of Men of Honor focuses on Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American diver to the deep sea in the navy. Her chronic rough struggle from being a poor farmer went to school to dive and even further. It's a good story, but it looks like it did many times before. Someone, against all of their chances, will not give them until they accomplish the goals that they have set for some sentimental reasons many years ago. It can happen, but a lot of brasher struggles in the film are doubts including C.O. at the school diving scams and final tests. However, all that made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally went into the movie. Deniro plays Mother Chief Mater Sunday who is the teacher of the school diner brewery attend. As soon as Deniro comes to read this vibe of extreme delusion that you can not hate unless you have to impulse bucks. Before finishing the film, Deniro gave several talks that would laugh at its cool style but you're too stunned in its way out of the punch. In the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the movie, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.
