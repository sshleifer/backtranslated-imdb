I'm sure this is a show that no one is familiar with and might not think good at it; after all it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, the place, the direct style and its advertising ?? shows women walking around on the beach and all that. No wonder people have misconceptions and decide not to look at it. <br /> <br /> It was wrong to do so. Cause after I decided to watch the show, there are actually more things going on, real juicy stories and conflicts, turning out to be really interesting look and pretty much ?? addictive. The history of the hotel clerk, the manager, the owner and their complicated life. Also enter the hotel's troublesome visitors and powerful man trying to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> I will not refuse this sucking act but it is not that bad that you will look away. The story is not so consistent but good enough. The soundtrack is very well fitting with the storyline and the action is all the time. I took my first episode couple to actually have anything to happen solidly so patience. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really enjoy watching this. Zillion Times is better than expected. <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please Review My Review After Reading It, Thank You.
