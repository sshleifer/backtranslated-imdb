I followed the tour two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie !! What a ride! And what a trip finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a spirit, wise, funny and talented! And what a crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water of Panama City, to see his torture was too close to Louisiana, the wonder of his eyes as he climbed into a hot air balloon, the excitement of the rafting Some quick, bet they eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This movie needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are additions to the heart of the younger generation. Darius was assigned a wheelchair. documenting accessibility issues; to take Darius on his life journey. and they are very touched, many lives. Do not increase the awareness of DMD and encourage funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
