The 90 comedy comedy, comedy situation similar to our modern day "My Family". Thatcher was the tallest political joke, Bill (Belinda Lang) blamed Thatcher for anything he could. "Bloody Thatcher" possibly shared with most of us. David's typical teenager, brain cuts and knife breads, Jenny, Moody's older teens, are only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben are working as much as they can keep their families afloat in the economic climate in the early 90s. Granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however, 3 series winter is where it all kicks off and more laughs that I care to count. Generally this show did not get the times to look better and should be kept temporarily longer. Clearly they could not carry on after Gary Olsen had died, but I think they should get rid of "Catherine Tate" "The Office" "Little Britain" and bring back the classic!
