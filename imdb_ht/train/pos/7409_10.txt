Looking forward to seeing a "nice little movie" from mainland China, I was sick-prepared. The dynamic family, community and inevitability of change has rarely been explored so expertly on film. Each solid character and I have been completely drawn into the story. The organization is more complex than American audiences will be accustomed. But there is no difficulty after the progression, even during subtitle reading. Jiang Wu, as the brother retarded, is a brightly lit light. Leave your cinema in your locker. It will be when you check out.
