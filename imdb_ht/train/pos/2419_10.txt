In addition to plans, trains and automobiles and uncle buck, this movie by John Candy. When it gets hypnotized with the playing card (as with the Candida Candle) and gets a horny guy who does not know what it says, it does two very memorable quotes (Both deals with male anatomy). The love scene involving supermarket items must be seen, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
