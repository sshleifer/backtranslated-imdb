The 60s are a series of mini swings well between historical facts and a good plot. At four deliveries, we follow a North American family, with 3 members. But we not only see them. We also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend, an extremist student leader, and a soldier in Vietnam. The film is just extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some shots in the Vietnam War, among the scenes. The next chapter, does not begin where one last one ends, begins some time later, giving us a small mystery about what happened. Overall, the 60's series is a must see, not just for ipatics fans, but for those with little curiosity on this topic.
