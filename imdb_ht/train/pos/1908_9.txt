This shows very well done. When it first came out to me though it has nothing more than a light-hearted family comedy and quite a few good one-liner covers. It seemed to express many families really well too, with different concepts of both parents and children, however, as I said, I never thought any more of it then looked good on an evening. However, I saw that I shot out the other window when the tragic death of comic comic comic fantastically accrued. The program stood the ground and truly commemorated the life of the characters in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all respected admins of Jan Ritter, a fantastic actor and talent doing nothing. When the show revealed after Ritters passed, I really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant me. I thought this shiny cast their talent to act in three children, particularly in Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words he had told her. He reminds me that no matter what terrible thing I tell my dad, I do not mean to say and it's very important to know this. Great Show
