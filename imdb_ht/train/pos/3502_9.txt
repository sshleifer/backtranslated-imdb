Wow! I liked this movie with LOVE Judy Marte !! This girl is not just a nice beautiful face, it's funny and really really talented! It made me laugh many times just was not very naturally rough and Victor who was desperately hit on it! We'll see him very much in the next few years ... and probably also of director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Ask Victor Vargas is one of the best films I've seen in long! Very refreshing! It's true, cute, funny, filmed, it's got it all: good story, good actor, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow paced, real life, urban movies, like perhaps Jersey Girls from Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It is best!
