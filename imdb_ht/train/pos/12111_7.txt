When I first started watching this animated I never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting, but thankfully I made mistakes. From that moment I began to watch it, animated just crawling into the world of bread making, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage in this anime is its humor, which is very smart and very funny, and some recurring guns. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these disadvantages do not see much of the first episodes, because of the great work on this animated, it really begins to show off the last 20 episodes, When the reactions and Renew gags just grow old, and not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this animated ended with Episode 52 I would give it a 9, but the latest Episodes just left a bitter taste, which sadly can not wash away in bouts Awesome 50. <br /> <br /> 7/10
