"One of Hong Hung's most humorous endeavors is death-over in such a part of Hung trying to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also in a bit where Hung pokes fun of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. Also very good, especially when Hung takes on a trio on martial arts expert in the end. It's not the greatest movie but very good for the Kung Fu '70, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. was warned, though: most video versions of the movie have shoddy quality. There's also a character in blackface that some people might get offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural hog- herder that moves in Hong Kong to combat some bad guys Sammo turns on dead-on Bruce Lee Imperation when fighting! <br /> This movie is often billed as an imitation of Bruce Lee in the "Entrance to the Dragon", but he not exactly that ... Sammo is a rural - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his family run a small open restaurant - Once there is a new job, he is forced to defend the restaurant from local gangsters looking for protection funds. When Sammo changed into battle mode, it changed to Bruce Lee to imitate it, which must be seen to be believing! This film is very sloppy, in many of the fighting scenes Sammo battle against who is obviously actor rather than martial artists, and there's a character who is supposed to be black who is played by an Asian man in heavy makeup ( and preposterous). But what this movie lacks budget and accuracy, and much more than make up of atmosphere and energy. Very recommended for a good mood. "
