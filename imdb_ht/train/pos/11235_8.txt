Gentlemen do, and together with "new travels" it's a great continuation! Fab sees James Cawley in the latest episode "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> I like the characterization is growing, and we think we have good replacement for the TV actors in a fan-generated piece. This show manages to take the feeling well, as they state on the Ste, has improved over the years with experience and I hope with some more experience, a strong script editor, and a pick-up of distribution and CGI that HF ​​will become more remarkable than it is already really! <br /> <br /> (I have a very soft spot for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT AGE), although I 'm a bit tired of the "Lefler Law" .Enjoy! Shelby' s Great (if a little little uptight) and it's cool to have gotten a nice commodore ship (like Fred Flintstone), but missing the bravest corner of a commander officer and looks too happy with himself. The Doc, Counselor, and Rawlins are right about money In my eyes, as is the Wonderful Nechayev (what a nice accent - a real Russian! (Well, I guess Rene hails from Czech rep.) <br /> It gets my vote, and the CGI is kneeling . Some of the obvious greenscreen, but on a whitney dayday budget? <br /> <br /> Really happy I'm fake with it! <br /> (OK, some of the act is not great, but it 's fan- made and therefore allowed to be variables - Came Clem.) <br /> <br /> The gay material is lying on too thick (Graham Norton'd be embarrassed). Fork is not paying much attention to married hetero So why signpost gays and all snoggi ng? It is not necessary to show the sexuality of a person at this level - I hope to tone it down & leave Aster & Zen there are no tokens - I do not treat my gay friends any different, they are just regular guys. <br /> <Update It is a mixed bag. I can tell all stock trek to OST things and work most of the time, but timing can fall flat now & then (the end of "Worst Fear Part 2" lacks the crunch, and the edit .Reality fact I use the "Music Galaxy"! <br /> I certainly can not wait for more !! Dazza <br /> "Never give up, never amended!" Border
