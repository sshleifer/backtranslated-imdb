In his work is a modest office desizing, but putting it on the dense floor with all the intensity of its bottles released. Surprisingly, this liberation is based on Japan, due to the rigid culture of compliance. At the beginning of the movie, all the characters are disappointed or scared of their desire to dance. They will be despised, or judged perverted, to express their passions in dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is well worth watching the revival of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face during the day.
