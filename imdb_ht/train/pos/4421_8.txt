Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the Japanese call the "piece pieces". Gojo is very creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. Brilliant, even. Waves of Japanese samurai films allow a peek into traditional beliefs of shamanism, devil and occult powers that were certainly part of ancient cultures, but not really explored at Samurai Kurosawa's era, or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would put Sogo Ichii director as one of the most interesting and creative of the new Japanese wave directors. Other recent Japanese pieces I would recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Zatoichi Shintaro Katsu: The Blind Guardian (2003).
