I must say I was impressed that the cinematography was amazing, the frames locked in perfection and the way it was built up the tension around a subject that sounds more like a terrific terrible is beyond. <br /> <br /> The movie is on two stories, one sees, one unseen. They both try to explain the meaning of a series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time back. The movie is all about the theory and explanation of opinion but the conclusion is quite shocking I must say. Definitely a movie worth more than it's voting 171. With only 66 minutes to play out her draw in the movie always felt like a complete job. Fantastic direction! I must say far better than the poet who read for some strange reason to remind me a bit. I think you can call it "jerk" word jargon. It's pretty much just a lot of professional talk about various theories with stunning visual effects but the crew and Ruiz pulled it off. At least for me. An amazing movie.
