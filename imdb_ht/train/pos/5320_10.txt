I began to watch this movie does not expect anything, just another film to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the artwork and main character, who enigmatic, does not talk much, really got me in that movie a. <br /> <I really liked this movie, it was dark, pretty well and really touched. It's a bit slow but the immersion was complete. The feared director did not let us know bits by the story bits leading to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes. The finish was unexpected with a twist I did not come up. It's not the kind of movie you see often.
