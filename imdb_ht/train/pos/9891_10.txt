I first rented this movie many years ago, and it was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to review some of the way-too-some way films that I was immensely enjoying in my life, I decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that the same passage of time does not have the least dulled shine in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, played considerably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she looks like Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burned her grandmother's grandmother after that grandmother , played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas, force the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to pay damages. <br /> <br /> The look is once fascinating and compelling - though, the core basic inspite, which deals with prostitution, is nicely canceled in sexual gratuitous steam content. The story revolves more in the interaction between the girl and her grandmother, and various other colorful characters with whom they come in contact with their lives - which, by the way, is part of the rough and dry part of Mexico . > <br /> The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic and a dream quality decides. It's sometimes on the border, but not at the point, say, a movie by David Lynch. It's also worth mentioning that the movie is very algorithm of nature, read the comments from previous viewers below. <br /> <br /> Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone, quiet and saddeness, adds just the right musical accents to emphasize the Mexican environment. Cinematography in rural areas, many of them are in the desert, are quite superb. The movie moves in a nice rhythm, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each stage I felt I had to recover the tape and play it again, just because it makes you want to do that. For me every way, it really is compelling. <br /> <br /> We hope you will see the movie in its Spanish language version, with the translation. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand very much in the dialogue. For example: "In the world there is not much time like money." ("The world does not just as I think" - that is, It's a tiny world.) This movie somehow reminds me of barriers on an old dirt bottle of ancient wine, which, on drink, is Extremely satisfying, however, you leave with some sadness about to realize that no more bottle just like this one.
