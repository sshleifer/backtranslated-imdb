What can one say about a movie that has one of the blackest, most nihilist, and occasionally most weirdly-I do not say 'sympathetic' .. I'll say 'charisma' villains in the history of the cinema, and the battle Swords best since Flynn and Fairbanks were on the big day of their glory? This is a season of a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest man fighting for his honor and freedom from tyranny. I loved it. Jan Hurt and Tim Roth were great bandits. Jessica Lange was very moved, sensitive, and sensual.
