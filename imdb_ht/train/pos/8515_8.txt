The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance at Christopher Lloyd, whom I love from previous movies. The movie was a great family movie, nothing would make you worried to show it to younger children, a good story line, lots of laugh, lighthearted and enjoyable. If you want to amuse the kids without bored with tears that fits the bill. Fun kids, and not hard for a parent to look, either.
