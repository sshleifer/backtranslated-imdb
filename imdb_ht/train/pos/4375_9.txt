Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but left a taste back to the mouth. Rob Roy, by contrast, is a little less polished, but a better movie is near. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes and truly historic values, whereas Braveheart puts a gross and unpleasant contemporary glow on an ancient story. What makes this movie is thrown off. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in his role basically darn (in a roll-down mode) of the Phantom threat. The character is heroic, but neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonistic lover. Admirable yet human, read the screen command. His account puts a selection of enemies similar to Cunningham Tim Roth's people, obnoxious, but brilliant, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt. Also to praise is Jessica Lange, like Rob Pragmatic wife: too strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is just as it should be. This is not the most original movie you will see, but he has the courage to trust his own, and the strong performances do you care.
