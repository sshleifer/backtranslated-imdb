Despite gorgeous and enchanting animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I've seen, and I do not slam Disney movie very often. Spirit is a sticky stallion that gets captured, either by the rider or by the Indian, both who try to "crush" him. The spirit ends to form a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. With the exception of the beautiful animation of horses, my or my five year olds were very inspiring or excited in this film. It's ironic that it's titled "Spirit", as mind that's what this movie could use a bit more. They gave an extra point for the band, which was enjoyable, and singing by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie rated G, you will still probably have the end to explain what "breaking a horse" means your five year old. I did. <br /> <br />
