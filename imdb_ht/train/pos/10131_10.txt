In the very first episode of Friends, which unveils Sept. 22, 1994 "One where Monica finds a roommate" has a play song like Rachel sitting in the window towards the show show, the play line is: "If you ever need keep ".... anyone who knows the artist's song or the title of the song? It looks like it's a great song .... I'd like to get a copy of it. Thanks for the assistance. I'm looking for the album / CD is so I can buy it. <br /> I have the shows available for buying and enjoying this show over and over again. It just seemed to be credible ... thanks for the hours of entertainment you provided during the years.
