Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's work is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than alive vigil, Lynch provides a reflection, fragile meditation on the universal topics of aging and family and finds reassurance at both. The true story of a farmer Iowa (Richard Farnsworth) riding a lawn mower in Wisconsin goes to his alien, tight brother, there are still many of the unique and original visual dreams (some rather bumpy aerial shots in the heartland, filmed- it's not veteran Cinematographer Freddy Francis) makes it a denied Lynch effort and characterization that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet persuasive way, allowing the stories he heard about his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turned to some of his finest work in a smaller role as mother of daughter He is still alert (with the painful secret revealed in a striking way in a gentle turn of the sensitive script by John Roach and Mari Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast of someone delivers unreliable performance, one of Barbara Robertson The most remarkable, accidental killing of a deer is both inevitable and sad at the same time. But this ancient Lynch and his ability to engage and disturb you to his best. For those who are familiar with Lynch or know it only by violent reputation, disturbing it, this is an excellent place to start; For those who know her work, this is one of the finest in her repertoire.
