After the Hard Hard Success and its end it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glute of 'Hard Death on a .....' movie taking off of the wrong guy, bad location, wrong concept time. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, dead Hard on a hill just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or my mother will shoot' Stallone's career. Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers, especially to those who are experts in mountain riding, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All of it's full of excuses to postpone the movie as a stack of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-act by a horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very enjoyable and imbettable movie that delivers as many emotions, and involuntarily, very laughing. <br /> <br /> You've got to love bumping evil littgows, ticking it all the boxes of baddies, and best of all, the permanent agent is harassing and preventing 'turncoat', Rex Linn as Travers. <br /> It may be Henry's 'portrait of a serial killer' but Michael Rooker is important for a creativity-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disquieting of his captors that man never hurt any man 'And also he can not, he really looks like Frank Ralph Waite's character is grinning as the girl plummets her death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! bit, Hal needs a good kick. So forget your best judgment, who cares if 'that can never happen', lower your expectations, turn the volume and enjoy! But if you are looking for Qaulen, it is one of the helicopters.
