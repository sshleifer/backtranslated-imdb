"Amazing Grace" has a lukewarm feel of it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building. The languages ​​spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and features of age groups that have the same aplomb. It does not judge the characters, only present them in a way forward, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and observations are made about the characters that are sly and sharp. I appreciate this film very much.
