After so many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' noted 1979 book "The House Next Door" has finally been filmed. The result veers a bit of the novel that, especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if it is uncomfortable as it's a TV movie, the whole of which is absorbed and actually very good, just not as great as the book, one In Stephen's Favorite King and one of me too. <br /> With more time running and less constraints as a theater release, all the wealth inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultrodern house have been explored and nourished, especially the climate revelations near many endeavors. <br /> Still, the entire cast does well in this thoughtful thought of mysterious misfortune. There are a few unnecessary shocks but the growing atmosphere of many developed pairs. Currently, one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting in the house by its next-door amateur amateur-artist who tries to visualize its corruption on canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read the great novel.
