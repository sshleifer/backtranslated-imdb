This movie has to be my favorite of all time. It does not suppose there is a draw, because its musicians wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) believed it was a real mustard film. This was an exercise in visual effects, and not cut away when the action happens like every other movie does. Movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving visuals to be done by computers causing its easier to deal with without CGI. There are still movie makers who still can not find fake blood to look like real things. There is no rape scene because that was not the point of making the movie. Did you see the hills have eyes 2? The scene of rape was funny instead of shocking. Although I'm sure some GONZO pornographic musicians have tried to get married porn and horror. But since they probably suck in film, they probably would not be able to pull it off. The film "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because actresses are actually porn stars and show everything even if the movie is absorbed. <br /> <br /> Too bad its that a movie can not do without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO rating or NC-17. I am sure Elith Roth has the ability / talent to make his movie cinema much better, but it has been too tame to go down to get a R rating ... or at least I hope his movies are squeezed because of these limits. <br /> <br /> Watch track of death or more than pumpkin smashed if you do not have real foot frills (crash & crime scene / footage). Do not forget that this film was born in 1985. The fact that this movie can still stand against most crap has made these days hard to say about this movie. That would be like someone who tells the 8bit Super Mario Brothers to absorb because the PS3 has the best graphics.
