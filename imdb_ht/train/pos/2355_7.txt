... but I liked this show anyway. I have read some of the comment comments previously said about this show, and I have a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism of my self (except one: the show was staggering; this program was ANYTHING but stale ). A lot of things are troublesome and on this show is about the money: firefighting; force; excess; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; harassed all-time narratives. But do you know what? I really like it. It was different, it was original, it really, really tried; and that made up for all the ministers. The show was bright, verbal, quick, witty, interesting, fun to look at ... you know, it was only about once a week, I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy li. I will mourn for him. But I guess nobody will bring this back to life.
