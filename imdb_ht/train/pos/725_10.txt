Specialist director Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who lansed by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she was ten feet high) has a plan to turn her high completely square. The complication that challenged this goal in Rock'n'roller delightful Riff Randell (PJ Sol that lights up the screen - it has received a warm tide, too) that is an obsession fan of the punk band RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide his stunning beauty) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the crisis supposed to kill rock'n'roll for good that mission wants to Togar a. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything, but getting put. Kate is crazy about Tom .. if only he could pull himself out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the movie almost (honestly, who can steal this movie away from Sol?) As Eaglebauer, the "supplier" who can find everyone almost anything. Her office is located in the boy's bathroom! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of the Riff when he enjoys a concert at the RAMONES. <br /> A great raccoon high school that challenges all the normal rules .. and I loved it. It's like someone just saying, "Let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours." The film really is anarchy ... a bad draw-less lovingly worshiping RAMONES and all of it's heart (even though they are awful actors, they have an opportunity to get this new audience with this film). which ends up pretty much sum up the movie as a whole .. Riff and his classmates take on the high school with a massive start party. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! Not conventionally in any way whatsoever, this movie just let's loose a crap. Accompanied by a great rock band featuring some of the best songs RAMONES, this film allows a viewer to accept a time of life when wars did not dominate titles and people just had a good time. These people, I guess they were the days.
