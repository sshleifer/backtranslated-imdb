In three remixes on the Roman Somerset Maughan, this one is one of the best, and particularly because John Cromwell brought in the movie. The film is worth a look because of the break in performance by Bette Davis, who as Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry he was a star. Finally, her struggle with Jack Warner and her studio paid in royally. The film is dominated by Mildred from the start. We realized from the beginning that Mildred does not care for Philip and never will. He does not hide it from this kind of soul that has fallen in love with the woman wrong. He will be outraged by Mildred again, and again, as he does not make any bits about what he really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, besides being disabled, is a weak man. When she tries to cling to Mildred, she dismisses him. It is when Mildred returns it, when it's brittle and beat, that he wakes up on the occasion, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who stole his will and his manhood. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis provides a fantastic portrait of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and ran with her. His betrayal to Philip's type is clear in the emergence of relationships. When she told her she washed her mouth after kissing she was one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard plays Philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in minor roles. This is Bette Davis shows, and you do not forget it!
