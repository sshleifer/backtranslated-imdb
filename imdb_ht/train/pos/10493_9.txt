This film is inspiring for anyone who has been in a difficult jam, whether financially or emotionally. You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) There's a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has found a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal that adds to the humor. Even my boyfriend loves it so does not think it's a chick-cops.
