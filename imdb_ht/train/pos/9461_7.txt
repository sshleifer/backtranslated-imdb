Steve Carell star as a person you can relate to (the sort of) of Dan in real life, a movie that I hope does not like, but ended his liking. Not that the movie is laughing loudly in it's just that it has a great heart. We all love Steve Carell, this is not fans of the Office would expect to see from him, but you know what I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell star like Dan Burns, a widow father whose daughter does not really like her. One weekend, he and his daughter traveled down to see his family. While she goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. When he returned home, he found that his fellow Mitch (played by Dane Cook) is dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). Teeth in real life, at times, I get a bit incredible. Does the Burns family really sort of people who exercise and play board games together and do a lot of stuff about family stuff? I would be very skeptical. I do not know any family that is like that. Is that what left me to give it a thumb up? No <br /> In real life: *** / ****
