A slight, good little movie should be assured, but a superbly-fabricated one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines at this early showcase for his British accent, and throws to assemble all his legs up the dialogue. This came out around the time in the sense of Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why one garnered all attention to Oscar. Emma is the most accessible to Jane Austen's crazy story, said well.
