This is the greatest movie I've seen in 2002, while I'm using mainstream movies. He is rich and does a beautiful artistic arts in these 11 short films. From the technical information (directors to choose), I was afraid he would have an anti-American base, but ... it's a kind of (11 times) paid personal tax. <br /> <br /> The weakest point from Y Chahine: it does not manage to "swallow its pride" and it considers this event as a worthy punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the movie, but this witnessed a real liberty in speech for the entire piece. The weird from the Mexican film almost concept-art ... I still do not know what A. Gonzalez Inarritu means. 9 others are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and it makes me smile, or cry or even let me be stunned. I still do not know if S. Imamura's movie is really related or not the September 11th catastrophe, but it's so nice where its final ones are deeply 'doing it'.
