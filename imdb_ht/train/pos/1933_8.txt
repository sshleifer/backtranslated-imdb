This independent movie looks like in the lives of a group of people who take an adult swimming class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What drives the movie is the characters, excellent played by mostly unknown actors. The standard of casting is Brewster as a high school teacher with marital issues with Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses provide natural performance and work well together. This is a first feature feature film for Schechter writer and director of Setton. The letter holds the narrative narrowing in a quick clip. The film title and poster suggests something raunchy, but this is a pretty little comedy-drama.
