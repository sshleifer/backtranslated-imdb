King of Mask (Bian Lian in China) is a beautiful and deeply shocking film. The 16 winner winner from around the world, this film is based on a true story center on Wang Bianlian, a street scene in China's 1930s that grows bigger, but has no inherited on his art of opera figures- change. He has a unique talent of rapidly changing performance mask, and no one knows how to do it. He has a desire to see a grandchild, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be spent on an inherited male. Then we go to the streets, and see that people sell their children because they can not afford to take care of them: some even ask for their daughters to be free, because their daughter is not worth much of this society . Wang Bianlian's story goes on out there. The film was so amazingly good, the act was amazing, and the issues were so heavy and adequate. There is inequality in gender and reality of depression at this time and place, no one wants a girl. Also interesting to note is that actor actor is famed that still plays a woman and known as Living Bodhisattva is a man dressed as a woman, and while she is famous and well-respected, she considers herself as something low, a half women. As we go further into the film, facing the problems of human slave trade and its demands and thus lack of a possible solution to it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, with the helplessness and lack of power any People can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. This is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another beautiful performance.
