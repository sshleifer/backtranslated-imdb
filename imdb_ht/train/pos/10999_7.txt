This movie is about this Wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a high-ranking company named Digicorp. This guy Wimpy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is happy with his miserable suburban life and wife asked him to decide to become a spy. He is supposed to attend conventions of other high tech companies and find out all company plans. Instead, Morgan finds herself attractive in a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and pretty much being double-crossed by two companies that force her to become a double agent. How will Morgan find himself out of this? Can she trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, Morgan can make it alive? Wow! What a Nifty Movie! I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It's very thrilling and you can feel Morgan in fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene in which to put this Morgan head head on brainwash is brilliant and scary. Morgan slowly goes to a personality transformation that is not so easy until you think about it after the movie ends. From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life. The finish, wow, the finish is incredible! The twist is so much fun! He left me gasping and cheering like crazy! Good performances from around, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
