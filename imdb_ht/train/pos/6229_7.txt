One of several musical pieces on sailboat, it is the usual sailor to meet girls, causing cause, sort out happily in sketch. It goes along smoothly, but it moves in the same place. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott looks out of place. There are some compensation. It has some of Irving Berlin's hot choices including 'let yourself go', 'I put all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's face the music and dance'. She had Fred and Ginger when they danced to take any movie in Heights in the sky and not to disappoint here. They make a pipe dancer, a funny dance knockabout and a dynamic whirlwind dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and artistic. She also had Harriet Hilliard who is rather good at her role. She has a varied career, Harriet Nelson and Ozzie become famous. Here he touches without feelings. The two songs are simply and effectively delivered. It makes a good contrast with ginger, but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More tightening up made the movie even better. Pretty good though.
