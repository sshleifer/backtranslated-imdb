The woman of Black was a British made for television movie that first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve in '89, and again in '92. I believe he had made a round on American television on A & E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's, but it came out in print. A US company released it on DVD later, but this version also sold. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights of the movie are now owned by another person and that it will not be released again, and that there are official bootlegs sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had checked it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It is certain to be a fake from a farmer in the distant east, though the DVD says, "Made in Canada," ha ha. But it is a good copy, and you can not really blame the bootleg labels for releasing rare items, out of print, and lost in legal disputes. <br /> I love the movie. It is a set piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and picturesque British surroundings of that time. The woman in Black is very atmospheric and obscure. For the most part, the film is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no independent gore, violence or much of all in special effects, but the woman in black still can create absolutely cool moments. It's a classic movie ghost movie ghost. The film itself seems to have been made in the 1930s except for the color. Without all the flash of all the movie horror movies, I'm afraid this movie will still just have a gem gem. For me, he puts himself as one of the ever favorites.
