For the case, I'm not affiliated with the production in any way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. More than 7 seasons (this is the last) were produced some 50 or so episodes. This is no feat featuring almost no budget and everyone volunteer their time and energy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> By their own admission, the earlier seasons have not as good quality output as later but as they progress the effects, green screen works and acting all upgraded. <br /> I found it difficult to "dip" so began from the beginning and looked all the way through. HF benefits from archive history just like all the best Sci Fi and dovetails nicely in the Star Trek universe in which it is set. Characters and "family" from the original series are brought in stories and add a lot to the feeling of their stories, sometimes improving on the characters on the original. The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper coil, a high membership forum that is frequented by many of the actors and production staff with a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high definition, high budget output, this is probably not for you. <br /> If you are looking for continued adventures of the Star Trek universe and the Star Trek racing story and make you think, this is the one.
