The previous result said it exactly. I saw it once, was enchanted, saw it a second time when it was re-emitted in a week or two in the first airing. I still remember some of the scenes. The environment is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was placed in a section of women only in a public square, which was a historic interesting note. This time when one of the first women touching the other is one of my great movie time ever. I do not think of this as a "gay movie," it's a story of love story tangible and sensitive period, where two principals happen to be women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this one if he ever came out on DVD.
