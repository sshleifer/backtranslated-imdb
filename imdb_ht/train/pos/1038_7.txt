Liked the movie. I even loved most of the actors in it. But for me Davis' very poor attempt at an accent, and his stubborn actions really make an otherwise compelling film very difficult to watch. Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. Davis should laugh at the screen. <br /> I really think it 'phoned this one'. Now, if Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman play the part of the wife I would like to read more. <br /> I think I'm just not getting 'Bette Davis. I always thought of it as an actor who 'plays himself' does not matter what his role in the in. The possible exception is now Voyager. <br /> I'm sure many of the other reviews will be explained by the attention (and I hope civilian) details are as totally wrong about that. But I'll continue to watch the movies because I like the stories / write / support casts, but I'll always think of different actresses that could do a better job.
