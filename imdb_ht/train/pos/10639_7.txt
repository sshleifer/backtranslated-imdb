Dolph Lundgren is back! Detention marks Dolphs first movie in almost 2 years, and that's the delayed Agenda Cover. This film always marks an improvement for Dolph on its cheapie trilogy in Jill Rips, Red Agent and Stormcatcher. However this movie well below the standard of Hidden Agenda, which was the best of almost every respect. What this movie has in its favor from the Dolf's outing before, is a sense of cheese fun. The film also had a Dolphin backslider back in a high action role, and it's good to see Dolph perform his own show again. These films are funny and the first B-movie material. An ex-military man is now a teacher and in his last days of teaching, while taking a Detention Class, he runs to some poor Slovakian guys who have taken over the school to serve as cover for a great deal of drugs. The movie has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of pleasure with all the clicks. If you take it too seriously the hearing will find little to enjoy. Fortunately the filmmakers do not take matters too seriously and together with all the action clicks you can think of with the predictability, this movie has a so bad it's kind of fun in vibe. <br /> <br /> Where the movie is left down is missing-using a fairly decent budget. The budget of around 10 million was not well spent. It's all up on screen and lots of carnage and big explosions but a lot of fantout are missing imagination. The opening action is okay but then the good moments become more rarer. There are some good times. You have a school car park in the hallway for example with a decent shooting at the start, with lots of destruction. The rest of the shootouts are mechanical mechanics but there are many going on screen. <br /> <br /> As for the throw. Hiding Agenda was the best cast Dolph's to work and to age. There was a good standard of actor for a DTV movie. This however has problems. The actors are on the worst part. The bad guys are awful, but lead the bad guy to have a kind of cheesy enjoyment because Alex Karsis plays it on the head and without the hint of any threat that you can laugh at the worst thing. The teens of the piece are actually good, but they are playing these peeled characters. They all hate authority, one with each other and have bad moods and of course the end to learning important life lessons, but generally decent and Chris Collins in particular have a love. This movie is all about dolph though. While this movie is nowhere near its best, it is nowhere near its worst. She also marks a turning point in her career. He is now back in good shape, and will be the even better form of his next direct direct action Shift. Dolph looks enthusiastically here, it does all its own waterfalls and it is good to see him play the typical action man (running in the slow-word blast, a covered hardware, and handling large guns) again in a movie like his older, albeit with less flair and imagination than kichich films like the One Army. It is good to see Dolph's power. His films in the last 8 or so years have seen Dolph looking a little tougher, and using a double one (he always does all the fights himself though), but the new dolphin is simple to look for. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not a single surprise but it has a kind of deviousness inept in charm. **
