The movie revolves around someone who believes that all forms of media are outdated. The idea behind his art project is to demonstrate the ridiculous culture that we are immersed in. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks funny comics (Caw, Caw, Caw), rock group, model, blockbuster Hollywood movie, and touches on many other means. Eventually, he found himself in the sights of the weapon he had put in motion. The movie is five years old and more true rings every day. It's the best description of the post-punk anger I've ever seen. It is also one of my top 10 favorite films.
