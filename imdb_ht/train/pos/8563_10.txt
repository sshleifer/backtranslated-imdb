The film follows the events of the novel "Sel mai iubit from pamanteni" (could be translated as "the beloved among men"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that became something like the Bible or the story of Hamlet, is very popular and hard to find, due to its satire about the communist regime. He represents the drama of the intellectual man, humanist, in a "red" world. A movie filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the largest Romanian movies, despite its psychological burden (after all, it is a European movie).
