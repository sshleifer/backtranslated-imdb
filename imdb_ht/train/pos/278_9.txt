I have to say, Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the Dead and Castlevania games but none of them captured the glee at most with which this game tackles its awful element. Barker is good at what he does, which is putting the horror of our world, and it shows as his hands are clearly widespread in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush visual and humorous atmosphere shakes a stick at, Undying is the beating game in my book as the best horror title. I just wish that this was done to a console system but alas poor PC sales that he had down that one in the bud.
