The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes it seem like we are in for a big dose of maudlin, ill feelings. But talented director Jack Gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right way, and it results instead as a compelling, dramatically moving drama wars with excellent production and lead performance. One of the best, if not the best TV movie in the 1990s would probably have been even greater success if it was released in the movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in the UK capital. Horrors of war on the front of the houses are not drifted on though, with the construction of the film until it's throat-lumping, misty-eyed finishes our leaves with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before. It's almost (but not quite) worthy to compare with the ultimate IT'S a beautiful life (1946) .All in all, a modern classic.
