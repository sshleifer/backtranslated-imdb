I know this odd sound comes out of a person born almost 15 years after the show stopped waves, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I love watching it. I love Adam the best. The only irritating thing is that the only place I found to buy the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and that was just the first two seasons. This is disappointing, but that's OK. I'll keep looking online. If anyone has any advice on where to buy the second of the 14th season, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. Just down the side is that the DVDs are from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and my computer. Oh well. I still own it!
