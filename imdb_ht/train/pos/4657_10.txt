Miliono Hot is a great movie in every way. A fun, story cut along with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time --- is a total enjoyment. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round out the cast and are also perfect. If you want a movie with perfect casting, this is it. What is impressive is the way people work in each other in a natural and hideous way, creating many laughs and exciting moments at all. Peter Ustinov was a genius and a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Directions, photography, and corrections are also first-rate, and it is a great time capsule in London in the '60s. It's definitely on my all-time favorites list.
