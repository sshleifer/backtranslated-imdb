The memory of the "Last Hunt" was stuck with me since I saw him in 1956 when I was 13. He was a movie that was far from others at the time of addressing the treatment of The natures, the environment, and the ever-present covenant between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as important today as in 1956, a cinemagraphic discussion of extreme depth and importance. At the top of the environment is beautiful and the excellent cinematography. The memory of this movie will be with me at the end of my day.
