Very interesting. The big twist was not as great a shock as maybe hoping for it was very dating, but he was thinking of working. He really thought me about a world without vegetation or creature and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more. Charlton Heston did a great job, as did all the characters to support, and it was a very realistic film that was surprising. He missed the direction of times and a lot of settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and smart film. The main fault that I could get was that I did not want the movie to end when he did, I would like to see what happened next. <br /> 7/10
