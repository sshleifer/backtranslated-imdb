I watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small movie theater in Paris. It was my last evening in the French capital and the best I could chose. These twenty episodes made me revive the impressions I had picked up in Paris in a heart-warming way without drifting off of kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprise, strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short film-led according to the rules of a good short story. For me this kind of film requires a lot more talent and kind of a director and a story board writer than any season of drama and all of them in place of their excellent work! The stories are carefully selected and matched to their match, and express their respective flair perfectly. Each episode was seen in a different ankle, there was a different subject, a different style and still twenty stories to the result of a harmonious film orchestra. The most outstanding advantage and concept of an episode of my opinion is based on the fact that you can switch between a great variety of sensations and humor safely in overcharging, just the other round way: melange in sadness, sadness, heart Joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion give this film a unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget all about subjects in love! Love between characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of directors and actors / actress for this project. I do not want to go through the details of these episodes since there are so many, but I must emphasize the range of world famous and actresses from all over the world and the approaches to this project. Some played with the images, some broke it completely with some interpreting stereotypes connected with their home country or their role played before, so the intersexes were given all in the movie. All in all I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on DVD.
