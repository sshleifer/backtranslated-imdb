I watched the first series avidly, but if I would come back after a break out of it. However, I hooked in episode one of the 2 series and was hooked all over again. This really is telely excellent; Land-breaking things like Mission: Impossible back in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded, and expanded as the series goes on, they change as they adapt - some more easily than others - in their new surroundings, but they are cleverly stuck in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone you would not think you might ever feel sorry for, when something really broke out. I hope there will be many years of 'Lost' look forward - and I do not actually mind all that much if I have never found answers to all the mysteries!
