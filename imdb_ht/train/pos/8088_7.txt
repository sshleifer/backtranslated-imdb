I remember watching this late at night on black and white television, long before a live-live version was so tiny as Peter Twinkle's eyes ... and they were very impressed. Lastly, I got this hand on a VHS copy that was thrown away (and that's not fair enough for the course ..?) I had the chance to review this movie, and found that it still stands up very well, although it's not quite successful in memory painted. <br /> I have confessed to a certain bias here. Some reviews announce themselves as confirmed Jackson-lovers, others like Jackson-Hater; I'm not exactly either. I was devoted to the BBC's adaptation by Brian Sibley original broadcast in 1981, and immediately recognized the voice of Gollum here - Peter Woodthorpe would reproduce this nearly-perfect performance for the radio three years later. /> I must say, however, that where I found Jackson's movie an increasingly indistinguishable version, the Bakshi version, for all that it cut into the bone, is actually more accurate. Yes, there is normal, the changes are understood (here it's Legolas rather than Arwen who substitutes for Glorfindel as the elf sent from Rivendell to meet the party) and there is a great deal of telescoping in the action. (The only exception to the letter, as others have pointed out, is the strangely prominent sequence of ford in Rivendell, where the Ringwraiths, has demonstrated a freeze refrigeration capacity and draws Frodo back to theft - where they are deployed again when it challenged them after crossing the river - then for some reason unreasonably chasing him in a prolonged galloping right, which is initially nightmare but pointless, drawn-wise, and definitely goes on too long.) I would also agree that Balrog's is not satisfactory, due to part of bad animation, and that his gangalf windmills override. <br /> But they both looked at the approach of the movie, I feel more than ever that the animated way is the one to take. In a story that is half myths (oddly enough, one thing that is included is a breeze in the Aragorn's history of Beren and Luthien) literally the extreme literaryism of live-action films, where everything comes from monsters in mail-shirts Must be created in detail to appear on camera, is counter-productive: latex-facing (or CGI) condoms are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn form, heroic costumes tend to look rather funny to tear on real, and hobbits or nose and body non-human Proportion can easily be animated but difficult to film concisely. Many revisions cited Ringwraith's sniffing in the woods, with his melee, half-human movement, as one of the horrific moments of the movie - it certainly scared me funny when I saw it for the first time alone the dark! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Book of the Shire - I particularly like the Proudfeet - corresponds effectively to the same change in the tone of the Tolkien proposal. I felt that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could be of great effect: Gandalf threatens Bilbo and his true power in the opening scenes, Bilbo seems to become a Gollum-like creature under the influence of Ring-lust In Rivendell, with the famous Galadriel's tale speech all were drawn more or less straightforward, where it would have been trivial to distort the scene reflecting the perceptions of changing buses. But generally speaking in detail with palette - fire tone in Bree, the brightly-re-emerging colors of Rivendell and the Fangorn Clearing, gray rooms and fires for Moria and the uninhabited countries - work well in reflecting the mood of their various types episodes, where a live-action approach simply does not allow you to blur the background or draw in a stylized setting. <br /> <br /> As a fan I did not care for either Jackson's or Bakshi in illustration of Lothlorien - yet, I felt that the sono radio was the best evocation I had come across a beautiful paradise , a little bit unearthly Woodland holds out in time - and I feel that Bakshi has received the elven songs at this point very seriously, but I do like the little mounting at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after the travis in Moria. Aragorn provides a hobbit-fence-lesson here as spacious (and equally uncanonical) spectacle as Boromir engages with the Hobbits of Hollin in the Jackson version. <br /> <br /> The description of Aragon as convincingly Weatherworn Ranger is good at all this movie (Viggo Mortensen's disease in Jesus looked really did not work for me), although it would have been interesting to them see how the 'second-half' character was planned for Gondor's benefit. Jan Hurt, definitely, gives a vocal vocal sterling, as a William Squire resonance in the Gandalf part. Hobbits are, I suspect, intend to reflect contemporary genres as audience-identification figures: I find the animated style (the proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human character) work well contrasted, and all 'hairy the whole body 'as drawn here comes across as more compelling than in more literal representation, including many art fans. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have fewer Boromir objections as Viking - it's always a kind of justice bludgeoning - than Barad-Aragorn (logic: both Numenorians, after all), although I'm clearly in a minority Here! The great flaw in this picture will always make the fact that it was a finished project, and a tackled tacked-on-off attempt to resolve their problems. A pity; It would be interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to see what Bakshi planned to do in Shelob and Minas Tirith, never mind the Dead ...
