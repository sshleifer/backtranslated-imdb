What I can say, I've raised up Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Sorption has always been different. The movies are part of our lives at Evolutionary Assistance times creating something hard to find. Love and family relationships that love with great. Vivah is a trip to a couple who will arrange weddings that turn on accommodation and wedding love. Shahid did fine work. Anupamy as always brilliant. Amrita Rao leaves different even though I felt that a bit the other with me does not suit to this role. We saw him in Ishk Vishk and Ab that barracks, and Main Ho on Na. So leave different roles that it's not in. It is excellent in Main Ho on Na and Ishk vishk but maybe she could have put little more into the role. Anyways will work by Barjatya. This film revitalizes the values ​​we forget. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a renewal, but noways brilliant story that's original. The Soring movies were brilliant all the way to always expect something different from him. Great work does not all throw the crew with everyone. Beautiful family movie to enjoy with your parents, brothers and sisters, friends and loved ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
