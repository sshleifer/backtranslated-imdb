# 3 of John Travolta's trilogy in blockbusters. It's dance for disco, rock 'n' and country rolls. She directs to Houston to find work and love. The Gilley is the warm place, and it is the time of the mechanical bull. Not to be outdone, I rode the bull in a club in Nashville. Recently I've seen almost forgotten this film on TV and remembers how good it was and how good a 1980s was. I wore a black cowboy hat this year just like Travolta. Debra Winger was in his prime. It looks stunning in her red head. There are many charisma. Bud and Sissy look like the ideal couple though they are trash trailers. They are divided just because it feels good back together. Urban Cowboy has an amazing band. We get heard Lyin's eyes by the Eagles and Lookin 'for love by Johnny Lee.
