Beautiful movie, one of the best horror movies in the 70s. It is realistic and atmospheric environment. As usual it was the inevitable normal negative comments. I have noticed that most films in a certain period many times fail to reach even assistance. It is obvious that most of the old sinister films and be denigrati are like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here. Before you read the review already knows what was the final judgment. In the movie a good gift because 10 is really well done. Rain it well with the movie as a way to which it produced reminds me a lot of Kubrick movie. It really impresses. Excellent movie really. I consider a movie anthology in the year'70.
