I must admit that for the first half hour or so in this film I've fundamentally lost. There were some humorous lite fun, but at best a barebones drawn with a general sense of powerlessness on the road to make me think I was wasting my time. And then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I enjoyed this. There was no momentous bluster of realization and no sudden dramatic scene grabbed me. In fact there is nothing interesting about the movie going on in the entire movie. It was as if I just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be hugely useless - and that in its gratitude was its charm. Morgan Freeman starred as an unknown actor who found a "small project" for her career. He will play a supermarket manager, and spend the day in a search neighborhood shopping on the role. While it is satisfied with good and red (played by Pegas Vega) - a cashier who wants more out of life. It helps her prepare for a job interview as she's audition for a role, while she introduces her to real life. It's really funny watching "it" (for that's how the character identifies in the credits) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target shop. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great together, and a strange but completely credible sort of romantic combine, but father-child chemistry. If you feel lost at the start, stick with that. In the end, it seems to be a delightful movie good. 7/10
