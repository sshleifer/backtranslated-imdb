This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best films known but it is not his best. Double Body, Wrath and Carrie are the best movies but this movie is better than blow Out with obsession. Two Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this film is a stripped off of Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair with his psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, turning down an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and he winds up sleeping with him. After this point it's best you do not know what's going on but there's a murder with Nancy Allen is a call girl who gets a look at the assassin. Dennis Franz is the detective on the case that really does not trust Allen and he has found the killer himself. It's a very good movie but not one of Palma's best.
