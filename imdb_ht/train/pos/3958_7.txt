The new scene, shot May 17, 1955, includes the storyline of Moe and Larry's sister Shemp's sister, along with the cooked in a turkey and turkey! A few new scenes are queue on the end of the movie as well (a double for Dee Green has been used, if you blink, you will miss the dual appearance.) <br /> "Mary Cautious" would make for a good movie and just the line drawn to marry the sisters. Budget considerations, coupled with less deliveries of commercial coils, influence the decision to use the greatest footprints. Although they still made the new films in the Stooges, most of the releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films and a few new top performers in "Mary Cautious," while one of these hybrids , is look and fun; we get to see most of "Bridless groom" again, and the new scene are funny enough to get the viewer in the movie.
