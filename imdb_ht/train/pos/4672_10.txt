I saw the Brother Shadow of the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as fathers and children. The film follows Scott Cohen from Liberty to Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He showed him because his brother had died, and he went into a quiet journey to fix his relationship with his wife and children and his father who never forgave him for being the sheep of the family . The story takes you deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of life. Also, prints of the Wood Business and Brooklyn Fabric lay the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
