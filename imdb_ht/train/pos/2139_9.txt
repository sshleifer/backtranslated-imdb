I approached this movie with low expectations, but it was very surprising. It is very well done and it flies but down the swing dance cinema in recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is nice and the colorful dance, for me the movie is not about to dance. It is about the very Japanese institution that provides long office office work to work with free time after work for entertainment that does not involve families. Here we have the man and the family to fill up with the big mortgage with a flagbridge zest for life. She is drawn to the image to attract a young woman to a dance studio and pass her while around her and this led her to try dancing salon. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion have made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes in dancing bullets, such as the movie's aim, definitely non-Western, though the discipline and music are clearly imported in Japan. Cultural contrast is so intriguing. Even without the cultural clicks, the color, the dance and the enthusiasm of players all do a fun movie to watch.
