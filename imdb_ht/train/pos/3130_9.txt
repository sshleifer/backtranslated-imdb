I am Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original and subtitle language) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately about here it caused a "panic" panic among mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, comparing the innocence of this crap kids to get them nowadays. So, because of the over-protection mothers from the 60s I've only got a chance to see perhaps two or three episodes! I was so frustrated I started collecting comics and bubblegum cards (always got them!) To compensate. I even got slipped to the Master ... I had an encouraging to see the Crusader guard. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> The years later I finally had the chance to see re-run as a teenager and I enjoyed it very much. Acting tongue-in-weight would escape to me when I would watch it as a kid, but I understand it at the age of 17. Yes, I've been watching them all now with the occasional soul online episodes because they have not released the series on DVD (my knowledge) <br /> This evening I enjoyed "Back to the Stick Cave" ... it was a pleasure to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a fun with this movie movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves as they played the parties in the series. Congratulations to those who have produced this great "nostalgic" feast ... I'll watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: see it !!! Rent it !!! Take her out of a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect myself to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
