Be careful with this one. Once you find metters on it, it will change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will be surprised a draw from all of these films nowadays, you will want to deepen character and development, you will crave mystery and unpredictability, you will require dynamic camera work and incredible backdrop. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in one movie kung fu, except for five deadly venom! <br /> <br /> Easy to get the best Kung-Fu movie ever, Venoms mixes a rich plot, full of twists and turns, and colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best cameraworks from the 70s. The success of a person simply the movie depends on the facets of the deciphering spectators that character is who, and who specializes in the veins. One is the Centipede, two is the snake, three are the scorpion, four are the lizard, and the five is the frog. Each character has distinctive features, features, forces, and weaknesses. At the hook lies we learn along with the student's character, find out who these different turns out to be. We are in his shoes (so talk), and we must choose which we trust, and which we do not, as it does. We learn with him. <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters, and the big camerawork, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more important than almost any other movie of its kind. It's worth quite a few watches to pick up everything that's going on. Venoms is a lesson on what kung fu can really do ... just do not expect many other kung-fu films to live up to its gantle.
