So half of the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I did not realize that the show was canceled halfway, which is crap. <br /> I think these followers of shows should write fox and ask them at least ending filming so that a season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then will see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. <br /> I liked the show and look forward to read every newspaper after the OC. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back and watch the show just to discover that she had disappeared? Needless to say, I am not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that no end was filmed. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what's going on. A half-filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. foxes, films end up damn and give some fans of the show to the peaceful.
