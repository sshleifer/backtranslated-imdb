John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horrific prank. He tells the immortal history of mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his homeland on Halloween night in blue stalk and kills a group of babysitters. This was the first and no doubt the best of the Halloween franchise. Woodworkers show great constraint in the story's rhythm very slowly and builds likable characters; strange for a horror picture. <br /> <br /> Even more weird is that of the existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains horrible Halloween to date. Find That! <br /> <br /> Halloween marks the first movie of Jamie Lee Curtis and a definite point in the late career of Donald Pleasance's great career. A true classic.
