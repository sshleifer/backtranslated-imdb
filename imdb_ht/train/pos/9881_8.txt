In the West Hollywood these trails were a bunch of rough when they came to town, partied pretty hardy. After all trail driving was a business back alone on the day before railroad arrived all parts of the USA. <br /> <br /> The drovers who worked for favor favorite boss Gil Favorite as played by Eric Fleming did not differ. But Fleming was a man of all business, having a job done and hired a top crew to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that the regulars stay with it for the most part, we've got to know all the drovers at some point. A few line story lines have been concentrated around all of them, though the great ones were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood characters at Rowdy Yates, the number 2 guy and the herd. Clint Eastwood's western image was modeled by Rawhide, it's a shame that these are not shown most often. Probably because of black and white. And this was a NBC show, this could be done in colors like Bonanza and must run as often as shown. We would get to see a lot more of a man who became a legendary move. <br /> <br /> Ironically enough it was Eric Fleming who left the show before he closed the movie. He made a few of them and hoped the show would give him a bankable movie name. Unfortunately he was killed on a movie site to make a movie action, drowned in a river. Had she lived she could become a name like Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as boss trails in the last season and then the show to complete its run. And it's of course became the icon it is today and not just in the western genre. Rawhide was a tough western that had some hard guys in it. No frills in this one, these were working cowboys just doing a job and fighting the elements and regardless of their situation being cast in every year. They really do not make TV series like these again. What a pity.
