With some exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays have virtually disappeared in the theater these days. Too arch, too talky appears to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's fiddle plays does not refute that verdict. It is certainly arched and talk, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, it is perfectly thrown to actors - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us have probably never heard of. Carter is splendid as the Bulgarian girl who sheltered professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later fell in love with her. One could contend with the specially ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian rider officer who led the charge of the enemy's line and succeeded only because the enemy had the bad ammunition for his machine gun. However, the role of guest-based Ryecart was obviously told about acting. Other players are perfect letters. Carter as self-dramatize the Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss-of-the-art soldiers in the play center, of course, and wonderful. Yes, "Gun and Man" comes across as a filmed play. But you'll easily see a Shaw movie that does not betray its origins. The schemes are generally smart. However, Shaw is all about the dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are unfair. Enjoy this for what it is.
