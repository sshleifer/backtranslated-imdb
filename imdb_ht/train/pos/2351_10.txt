First I want to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate fantasy is fantastic. What makes this show so unique is the hyper reality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. Where there is the wonder of fantasy children's story gone, much like a rip off of time. <br /> I say it is originally worthwhile because it's a polar opposite to the masses of television-all-out TVs Do not leave any place for imagination or foreclosure. It is good to add a bit of escape to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Hyper-Reality is my favorite aspect of the show. The 1950s-esque environment, innocent and bizarre characters, and the landscape and physical environment does not mean to be taken as pure quality. This mask shows the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. While entertaining, other TV shows took a shelf back in this series. It really has restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and amazement on television. <br /> Push Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
