... than that ;;) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would work together on a movie? This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at a certain point, the story moves right in the twilight area ... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing ... and nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring the movie's new settings to become really enjoyable ... bouncing heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> nevertheless ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise of this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalist, unusual, but very special design, which makes it difficult to find the place in the story or its time ... timeless somehow.
