Paul (Jason Lee) is a underachiever who just happens to engage in a Princess-type princess called Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her dress and her daily schedule. In his undergraduate part, Paul gets a little drink too and somehow ends up taking a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back in his dig. "There's nothing happened", as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phone. He is on his way to Paul's apartment. Understand, Paul hustle Becky out of place, although his trunk is left behind. But there are even more fun ahead. At a family dinner at Karen's parents home, Paul runs up in Becky again, learning that he's Karen's cousin. Speaking about some explains doing! But instead, Paul chose to make a stomach upset and hide in the toilet. Will Karen ever find that Becky spend the night at Paul's place? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry to criticize that movie movie like this. They should definitely lighten up, for this movie is cool and fun. Of course, it does not hurt Lee's affair is a complicated comic man, Stiles is a good beauty or that Blair is a natural as a nice but handsome fiancee. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, are also quite nice. Looking at the movie is wonderful, as are the costumes and California settings. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspiring, creating great laughs for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. It may not be Academy Award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a good one.
