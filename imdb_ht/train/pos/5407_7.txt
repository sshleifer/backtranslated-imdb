I always enjoyed the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and make sure, even if they are aiming at toddlers are too old in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement, "Hey, lighten up, read in a movie, "but all that aside, are not always good pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are, I love them so much. This one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. It has been a really sweet and touching moment since it is the introduction of the lovable, cool Pokemon Celebi. Not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, though the third is not bad, and the whole series is just fun, harmless, fun popcorn family and should be considered nothing more , nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the point / end, like making all the installments, and the characters, while somewhat more subtle than the previous three, I thought, are always likable and funny. This film is the lowest rated and most criticized in the long-range features long adaptation, and is not worth it.
