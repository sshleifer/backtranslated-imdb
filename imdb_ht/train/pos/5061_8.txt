Well worth seeing, especially with the beautiful twist of a journalism and integrity, you are expecting a big fall down history story as Gray Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and add to the generally optimistic theme with uprising and drama in the story and movie. This had to be Brosnan's best performance on date, he was convinced to admire the English-speaking English boy. Standing outside the scene is returning to it? Aunt? where Brosnan and the two senior actresses make a wonderful scene full of feelings of nostalgia and a lost life with little dialogue, just with expressions and good direction. Do not do. <br /> The story is so little known and the universal and all-important message is a real pity this movie did not get better recognition, maybe in time it can become a bit of a classic and a Travelers. I hope that. <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
