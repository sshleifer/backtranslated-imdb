This is still the benchmark of Golden Golden whodunnits, and taking into account the limited and dubious technology ethics of the authorities (on screen) bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since film and television. Fast and furious with a lot of brain Warner Bros, and fortunately there is no time for a love interest he galloped together, taking the splendid cast and the end to violent. I never understood why the DA had Vance trails around everywhere, I always thought they were deskbound. Palette as the detective, but especially Girardot as the doctor are delightfully unique and un-pc - when glancing over the victim to his second victims sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway. Of course it is William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director) who makes the movie what it is - when Powell ever makes a dude? <br /> <br /> The army of cops in the crime scene did not really do a very good job of finding the second dead body and unconscious dog they were! The best way is where Vance tells us all the sequences of events that surround the murders - dodging model sets combined with fantastic fantastic roving cameras to produce a lot of modern, thrilling, and past. The only problem is as usual the conclusion can not match the overall deductive processes appear at all and a bit start is invoked; Some Chan, the Moto and many others of course could only be concluded in this way too. But because it happens so fast and is ... a little dubiously it does not diminish my views of KMC's status as a classic! <br /> All the prints I've ever seen in KMC are (at worst) as looking at a bullfighting bowl, so if you are interested in seeing it brings with it until you're sucked in.
