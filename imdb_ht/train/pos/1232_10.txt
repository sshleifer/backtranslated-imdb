Very funny movie. Classic movie Eddie Murphy in the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I got a good memory. The classic Ivorian of Murphy does not fail, the movie is funny, well done. Murphy in the '80s has made many films in action that represents him a joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some handwritten films from 1986 up to now has changed. The atmosphere for a movie at that time is good and the special effects are good for a movie of the period. A beautiful movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of Murphy's ironic, an actor who has recently disappeared. The final part is anthology, the liker actor who plays part of the monk Tibetan. That's it.
