Several years ago when I first looked at "Gray Gardens" I remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp. Years later I still laughed loudly when I watched it, but after a lot of watching, I came to see the beauty of strange, twisted relationship between Edith Bouvier Beale's inseparable "Big" and her little "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale daughter. / <br /> Mother and daughter living together in the rotten 28 rooms East Hampton Mansion adds a whole new meaning to the theme "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, rats and oposom as this Aunt and Nele's Jackie Oolock colonel allows Albert and David Maysblower creators of the movie castles to live their lives day by day. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving story of true love and lawlessness. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbroken bonds of love. And their lives are an example of driving, determination and free-will. This movie is more recommended than I can put down the words. It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself. <br /> <br />
