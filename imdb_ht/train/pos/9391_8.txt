Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but this gives its neo-noir juice the crappy hopper, violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness. <br /> <br /> An inflated balloon for a hit-man, and try to make a little dough out of it, but come to mind. <br /> I found a strange parody of the opening scene of this movie, when cages walk through a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work, with the help of his friends ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But this is another story. <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... cocky, one-step-front galleries, broth and violent explosives. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man and a black past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost). There are only 4 real characters in note here, with the exception of the hard -for deputy of the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first twist hit earlier, and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some little town sleep. Meet. 8 Pts.
