Enchanted April is a tone poem, an Impressionist painting, a masterpiece of transmitting a message with some words. It was one of my favorite 10 films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patience, for the movie out of DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> If the Amazon parent company is incorrect, there are many who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy and throw this with this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. Throw is spectacular, cinematic and impeccable. The film is a definite defender. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
