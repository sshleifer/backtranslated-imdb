I saw this on a flight over into the US and was a little uncertain at first as a few people said there were so many characters in it that you did not get to know any of them. However I did not get this at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The scenes kick off are excellent and yes it can be predictable, but not true of the movie. The main villain is a bit of a down, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could, but that's always said he's a good movie.
