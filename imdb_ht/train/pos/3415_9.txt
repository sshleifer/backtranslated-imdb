This movie was amazing. It's an inspiring piece of movies. Characters are fully developed in the truth by which Director, Lucy Walker brings to the film. I highly recommend this to any looking for special films that show the humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker beauty exhibition in landscape. This movie IDs a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs. man. The intimidation of the interior and triumph is tremendous in its subjects. The subject of how Tiebtans sees blindness as a sign of fake spirits. This movie shed light on a particular culture that has never been presented. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he did not hear normally. Thank you Lucy for your true vision as a movie star.
