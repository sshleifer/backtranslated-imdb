I have read many reviews on this site to criticize the blister of being cheese and or campy. The movie was flawed for entertainment to act with weak effects. What would you expect from a group of people who have only experienced the production of low-budget, locally produced (PA Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me say these reviews critically overlook that this film has never taken a great deal of it. This fact should be evident in the mismatched theme music filled with funny lyrics playing on the opening credits. For what it meant to be, this movie is excellent. I've seen a few of the latest ultra low budget attempts, Blair Project Witch was one of them, which has absolutely no value for entertainment or smart thinking behind the drawings. BWP was most outrageously. The pate, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and quite fun. The scene where the old man came across the meteorite and pokes the mass with a stick was excellent to do and really climb. The scene of the doctor's office and the patty slowly moved under the blanket on the gurney while burning the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone who has taken $ 120,000.00, inflated for dollars today, and making a movie anywhere near as fun and or as successful as the blob. It just can not do. PERIOD! Thank you for taking this time to review this.
