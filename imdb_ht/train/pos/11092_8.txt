52-Pick does not have the respect he should have. It works on many levels, and it has a complicated, but consistent scheme. The actors involved provide some of the finest performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider, and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide portrayal of portrait characters. Notable also is vanity, who would be parlayed in a serious active career giving the unexpected ability to show, and Kelly Preston, who's character will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action combined with a complicated intricate story will enjoy this.
