I was about thirteen when this movie came out on TV. It is far superior to action than most films ever. Martin Sheen is excellent, and though Nick Nolte has a small part, she also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb. When the Sheen "water test" at '34 Ford Ford (COOL) on the highway it is spectacular! Grand. <br /> I'm disappointed in the low vote this was received. I figure out that younger generations have more interest in many of the junk that are coming out these days. <br /> <br /> Delicious eludes the masses!
