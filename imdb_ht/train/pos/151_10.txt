The movie is designed to affect the audience and this movie let me speak. Gorgeously photographed and well-behaved dialogue that approaches the movie's poetry involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, robberies and deception. It pulls an intense web that let me get my eyes off the screen until the credit ends. The story is sweeping. He took the hearing at the atrocities of the Hispanic Civil War in the human shots left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who order the screen. Support the players to throw away and borrow a real sense of justification. Together, lighting, landscape and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love the photography.
