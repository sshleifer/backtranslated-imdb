For a Danish movie, I must say, that this is very good movie. <br /> It's a class of its own, yet it has an international potential. has a great budget, and it begins to famous Danish actors, and a new one, who plays very well. It can be watched by anyone who likes adventures, and a little bit of film 'ghosts'. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, have thrilled!
