A kid with ideal that tries to change things around him. A boy is forced to become a man, because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the right of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands, and tells the truth. A family falls apart, and fights against it. A movie you can not hide from. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that until you die will hope never happen for real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a boy who has, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a kid with power, and a kid who acts as a pro, as he never did anything else, he caries this movie in the end, and anyone who wants to see how abuse was found back to 60'ies them.
