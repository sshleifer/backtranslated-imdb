I claim no matter how hard I seek I will never find a better movie version of "Othello". If you like the wonderful magnificent Kenneth Branagh's "Many Hearts on Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I make sure I'll find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible. Laurence Fishburne was in a variety of high-quality roles during her career. He was very formidable in the "boy n hood" (1991) - I always considered his entertaining role in furious styles as his very greatest success. That was, of course, way before I saw this. <br /> It plays the part of Othello and is probably the most difficult role of his whole career, but it does a brilliant, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely good Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh are just merely phenomenal in a most fascinating role in croaking the story, manipulating the Iago. Wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious work. He deals with his favorite topics: Crusaders, jealousy, deception and jealousy. This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films I've seen this based on William Shakespeare's play.
