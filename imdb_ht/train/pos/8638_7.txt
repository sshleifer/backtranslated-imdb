David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California, but it can not really pay, so they 'share ride' with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save their spending. to stop at various killings on the road, site where serial killer has made things, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt ( Earley) and Lewis are serious assassins and girlfriend who just go along with whatever he says. I do not care for Pitt as a rule but it does justice to the psychic role. The pair is afraid he's doing well, I was actually KNOWN people like him before, no, not killer, but with very much the same attitude. Anyway, as the road trip goes along, Carrie guesses that others are out of money, but Earley looks still coming with the cash somehow .. ..you idea that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it even if Lewis does our roles You, one that it excels in, a non-too-bright waist There is a good heart, but does not understand that he does not have to wear up and be up in Earley when he does something he does not like. As things begin to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple should be set out at a gas station, and unfortunately it's at the point where it's inside that he sees a news bullet that tells him exactly who they've been up- share and, after things go down for them in a quick clip. This is not to blame the greatest movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I watch what was supposed to be the version of 'unrated' but I wonder how much has been cut out of the rated version, because this looks like Fairly tame me really ... not that this makes it family fare or anything, unless it's perhaps the Manson family. 7 out of 10.
