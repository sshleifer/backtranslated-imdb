I suppose Jedi is now chronologically to be considered the "latest" entry of the popular legend, and it is a very good, as well as several of these. I loved how directly this end took after EMPIRE STRIKES back, and I appreciate the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing a lot about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I enjoyed the pursuit of chase in the woods, and I felt there was a lot of emotions that were well achieved with this chapter. The finish (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully draws all 6 chapters into a beautiful story of fantasy. I know so many true fans of the Star Wars hated George Lucas for the change he made to the original films, but being a relative initiation in these movies rather than ending in life and not missing what I did not already know, I think He did these 6 movies work perfectly as whole entities. Oh, and, mistake - Carrie Fisher looked quite good at his skimpy outfit.
