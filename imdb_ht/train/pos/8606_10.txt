It appears that there is no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream, and, like most dreams, it's often crazy and logical. It is also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angels. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's Space, insulting insults and various other faulty passions in the dream's hilarious dream, and her jitterbug and Binnie Barnes are a surprise and fun. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the Final Trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> It's a surreal comedy - lots of fun if you can find in the groove.
