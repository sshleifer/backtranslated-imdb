Well, sorry, but I liked this movie. I just love all the genre 80's of these types of movies, because you do not see much like this one again! I want to ask everyone who says this film is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what is it to imitate? I have never seen another movie like this one, well, no horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically its on the popular group of the school, who loves to make everon life live hell, so they decide to choose on this boy Nerdy named Marty. It looks fatal when it really gets hurt by one of the small pranks. So it's like 10 years later, and the group of painful friends Marty begins receiving Reunion High School letters. But ... they are the sole recipients! So they return back to the old school, and one by one gets hit by not ....... Yeah you probably know what happened! <br /> <br /> The only part that shame me was the very end. He could have left, or think out better. <br /> I think you should give it a try and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ~ ~ ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
