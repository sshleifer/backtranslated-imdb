I just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here. I understand he does not like the movie, but its reasons are not obvious. I feel about this movie is that it is not afraid to travel the darkest roads in loneliness, failure, disappointment and distress. Each of these two people, as described, has many reasons to be bitter and upset, yet to get the tenderness and comfort of each other. Only great act could do this job without becoming an emotional, sentimental and vampire colleague. I really became interested in these people because of overwhelming humanity given by these strong performances. I have every reason to blame Jane Fonda for Vietnam's action, but personal feelings apart from being awesome in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man of intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in an unspoiled world of his abilities. This is the first I've seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than the harshness of selling a character and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw it and I looked forward to seeing it again.
