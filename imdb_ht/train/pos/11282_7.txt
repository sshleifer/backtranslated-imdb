This was the second in the series of 6 classic "Tarzan Classic" featuring Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. As usual, this was a wonderful movie in this series; and maybe to come out as a "in between" movie of a progression that could almost show example of movie development from the early 1930s in the 1940s. As such, it appears good pace, but not as good as subsequent films. Likewise, the movie less accomplished than later Tarzan movie in this series. The stock I saw was in uneven quality, with some grayscale scenery and some under-exposed and sub-exposed scenes. The dry display of later tarzan film missing here. On the other hand, there is a very early scene, in which movements are hatched in a camera and swishing foliage in front of it as the back camera, showing safari people forged in the jungle, was really nearly modern in it style, and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> About draw, one interesting feature here was Jane's pre-disease and inconstancy, when she was being the subject of Martin's flirtations. Bo a ?? and Jane's stunned, and partly guilty, reactions ?? featuring something in Jane's we see in the future as well in these films. Compare, for example, to Tarzan get a Son! Jane Dupli's action tricking Tarzan and delivering her family to her boyfriend. Later he admitted Tarzan that he was wrong. Here, there is nothing so explicit, but we have Jane Parker's Jane "return" in passing, and in a series of repetitions of action, stripping himself in evening gowns brought by Martin and Harry to lure away Tarzan . / / <br /> There was a whole set of drawings and sequences that especially hit me in this view. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the picture we get in the domestic life of Tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll and always the possibility of nearby violence. That's me much of the core of the Tarzan experience. <br /> I was really surprised by some violent scenes even today by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole set of scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan leading the elephants to the Valley of the Elephants graveyard; The Tarzan was delivered to the death of the water by the Ipopo, and then the curse of health by the Saints; Cheetah will get Tarzan when Jane and others are trapped at the foot of the abduction; Cheetah in particular cross the river over the bottle. The final battlefields of wild & lion on the ground and wild & evil of the trees. Jane, showing us that he is really in Tarzan's world right now, quickly displays his enterprising bwacraft to work on a line of fire holding the lions off. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is splendid: suddenly tarzan on the scene, flinging wild from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants in the rescue! That's the final Tarzan song of triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, with a dancing and thrilling Cheetah beside them, is a memorable and really photograph of a fine summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. All in all, this is another wonderful Tarzan movie. I would recommend this movie strongly for anyone.
