I watch this movie in happy shire. This is perhaps one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much from it it's amazing. Some parts are moving, funny, and just great. <br /> All aspects of staining on, the painting of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even the little finer Irishness was covered. <br /> The use of low and high vaccines gives two great views of Cristy (look out for that). Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I never saw an actor doing that, ever. It's really amazing. And it's so great to look, it's flowing well, it's probably the closest thing to get in real life experience. I love it. <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. There is no doubt about it, there is something for everyone.
