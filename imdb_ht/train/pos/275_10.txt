This film starts out with a family that all went in different directions and their young daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). Mom played by Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne) who suddenly walks on her daughter and Zack makes out and then all kinds of problems seem to be the surfaces. Jill Dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often. There are also major issues that arise when the family decided to go on a camping trip that Olivia, his daughter does not like and just can not adapt to sleeping out and asks for a tent to keep all the bugs. In many ways, Olivia performs an exceptional performance while young and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) provide a strong support as a hotel owner. This film will keep you guessing how it will end, and you will enjoy a film filled with lots of horror and horror. Enjoy
