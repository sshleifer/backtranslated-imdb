An end to the angels and face dirty in not only, the angels wash their faces to suffer a bit of the usual lumps of dead dying children. As a matter of fact, and the presence of dead dying dead with Ann Sheridan this should be treated as a current end to angels and face face, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, it is one real bright light in this movie. To recall a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read in a phone book for two hours and I would buy the DVD! Another virtue of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this film aspect is caught too far in the background. For a better example of Duo Sheridan-Reagan I would recommend Juke Girls or Kings Row.
