In the 1990's, the world of Disney's animated cartoon was certainly in its prime. Show like Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi bears have already been popular, and now Disney has done another cartoon and this cartoon has made the birth of Disney's Afternoon. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about Baloo Bear's old Jungle book character as it gets a job in the airline business. In the series he met Cloudkicker Kit, former Air pirate and good cloud surfer, business Lady Rebecca Cunningham and his Molly daughter hyperactive. This series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you can not understand as a kid but understand later about in life. This is a cynical writing and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buying this for your kids to let them look at all of these cartoon characters Nickelodeon. If you liked TaleSpin, then check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troops". Spin it!
