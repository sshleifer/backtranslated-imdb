~~ I could see this film yesterday morning about an early pass to ~~ <br /> I'm a mother of 2 children, which varies between 11 down to 6. So I'm sure many parents can have reports and they have seen many "kids" movies. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know if it was true in the book or not. But it sure took this factor to a high level. This is the story of the kid's "new" kid and it just so happens that there is a group of boys who have formed a club of style and love to choose about kids .... sound familiar? Not all of us have suffered this time or another. He has the little brother who he cant stand with parents that he is embarrassed. What I liked most of all saw how each character was totally different from the others all stood out. The bully (why are they still making the bully head bully? My daughter has red hair! And it does not have any intimidation .. .. lol) is quite a big bully, who finds herself being called by his own great brother. It takes twists and turns and your goods fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters! Even parents, great connection between father and son. All around enjoyable, sweet, funny, gross etc. ...... Take your kids !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
