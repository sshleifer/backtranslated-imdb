Do not think of this movie as just another movie movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a strange mix of a movie, as it seems to have a movie in it, but at least it makes sense to the end (unlike modern films!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (drawn decent, good characters - Well it's star Muppets, a list of smaller stars * that movie would clamor for) What's surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all make an enjoyable family movie that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * The stars in the movie are actually top stars of the day, but there is only one true star of the movie and no salt dwarf outhine Miss Piggy !!!!
