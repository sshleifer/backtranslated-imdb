Lensman is a smaller-known gem from Toho and MK studios. She is injured based on the novel, but she reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see that, look it in Japanese with subtitles or just plain Japanese. The English armed version was almost trim and modified to death. <br /> <br /> There is not much new, despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature combining CG-graphics and hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to look, nevertheless.
