I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the first quarter season (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was immediately hooked afterwards. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I rating it 10 stars here. That's just so good. What I liked about was the opening and closing themes, and of course Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of every episode, but most of all, the relationship between the Judge and Mark while they worked together crack each case. I was so tuned that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent set of discs, I believe you should buy it and put it in your collection.
