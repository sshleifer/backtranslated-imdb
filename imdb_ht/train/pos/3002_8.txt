The "Chen Murder" can start off in a run and does not stop until the end of many. Everyone had the right to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. Mari Astor is refreshing as set-on niece who only wants to get married Scottish Scottish guys and enjoying her inheritance. This film comes scary with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have rented the disc (or check it out of your local library), do it. It's more fun!
