I really liked this movie! Though it was not anything like any of the books it still is the classic Nancy Drew style. I've seen a lot of advertising for this movie and since I was really in the books Nancy Drew I had really high expectations for this movie and most definitely met these people expectations. Pretty much of all the characters was exactly how I photographed them in reading the books. I'm really happy that I saw this film. All actors and actresses really act as they act like in the series of books. Ever since I've seen this movie I wanted to read every book Nancy Drew Drew out there. All of the actors and actresses really got into the characters and it definitely showed when this movie movie on the big screen. It definitely seemed like all the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters in me most definitely gave this movie a 10 out of 10.
