ERROL FLYNN has been one of his favorite roles as the braggart to cook in an Irish family struggle that has become a champion of heavyweight in the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) is around to claim that he "was can beat anyone alive. "Both Flynn and Ward Bond provide that is probably among the best performances they've ever provided on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh has led the colorful and stylish style story, capturing family life as well as hot-hearted and true humorous scenes. All the war dealers Warner make up the fine - including ALWAYS ALWAYS as Flynn's rambunctious dad, proud of his son's fighting capabilities, and ALEXIS SMITH who are doing more in his role as a girl society scouting which enjoys taking Flynn down a peg and saucy one-material related to behavior itself. <br /> All in the 1880s atmosphere captured in B & W glorious, although it's too bad Warners did not have more faith in Flynn making the film in color. He entered a rock phase in his film career at the time, engaging in a widely published publishing trial that all the tabloids were busy sorting things out. The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographers for the screen, and Flynn obviously in fine form and make very little use of double for most of the action.
