This film is about a family of dysfunctional, but not just a dysfunctional family. It is about the Family of the Father in our country (India) although, the film focuses primarily on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and her older son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he sacrificed his family life in order to achieve our liberty. Each time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son would try to get Mahatma's close up between them. This is a very well-done movie. Akshaye Khanna has proven herself to be a Top Actress. It expresses very natural emotions. Darshan Jariwala is mainly the star of Gurukant Desai's cast of guru attorney to describe Gandhi beautiful. (Like a Human Human, Unlike Ben Kingsley Who Made Him Look Like a God) Shefali Shah The Girl from Monsoon Wedding also has a really good job in showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son . This movie touches and is its band "Raghupati Raghava" sings in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai earlier on the 2nd) and when the movie was over there was "Pin Drop Silence" and while exiting from the theater by someone pushes another (Can you imagine our Indians do not push?) NOT ONE! There was a sacred silence ...
