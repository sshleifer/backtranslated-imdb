Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think of. These are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and work very well together. It's like poetry ways to play on each other and to supplement the natural ability to seem as if they were the best friends for eons to even shoot the movie. The movie itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to see the first, and the four stars help the ability to re-look at a great extent. I can not describe how good he saw Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey simultaneously on screen, the greatest moment being when they looked at a couple from a distance and filling in the vocals themselves, it almost brought a front water je m '. <br /> A good movie, a great cast, go see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
