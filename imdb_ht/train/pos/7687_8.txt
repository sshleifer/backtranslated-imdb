Like Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms that has never been revealed in the UK, not to mention it was from the 1970s - a decade where I was not born again. /> But like most fans of the show, I watched a few episodes on You Tube - and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans Family was led by James and Florida - two parents are trying to make ends meet, and despite lack of eligibility, encouraging their children to have their own aspirations in their accomplished life and take the chances. James was the strict father, but who liked, who did not dare to hesitate in discipline J.J, Michael and Thelma - should be on-step the line. While Florida, in contrast, was a beautiful, beautiful and considerable mother and wife love, although she was in many ways similar to James, with regard to the attitudes of parents and family values ​​from an American Afro perspective. <br /> Children were as lively and entertaining as their parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a jumping personality and crazy sense of humor, who would often wear multi-colored teams, with 'DY- NO-MITE 'catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as' Arnold Jackson' Whatchoo's' Willis bout '? from Diff'rent Strings. Michael was the smart-alec, who dreamed of becoming an attorney, also Thelma sister had its own dreams and hopes. His verbal taunts and JJs were mostly hilarious, as was the love / hate relationship between siblings, who played out well by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> During the seasons, there have been a few emerging appearances made, most notably from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as herself! I actually prefer good times on saying, the Cosby show, which was a 80s show because a) I preferred the Evans family on the Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) as I felt it addresses serious issues with difficult social, in a way that resonates with many viewers. It was a comedy but it was also a social commentary aimed to emphasize the lives of working class, African Americans in the 1970's. The show Cosby tried to cater to the mainstream audience in a 'candy coated way', as Huxtables were described as blacks who easily assimilated themselves to a top-class US college we would associate with white, while the Good Times of contrast was more 'edgier' and he was not afraid to address such topics as drug abuse and children in a realistic way. I actually found that also that the Cosby Show can be fun to look at times, it was missing that bit of 'sash' that Good Times has and in which made it trendy and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show did jump to the shark during the latter season, as it continued after Jan Amos's character, James died in a wild accident (in fact, he was known at the time that John left the Good Times for good. So his character's death was written as it is on the show). San John, the show suffered from misfortune, lost a lot of its charms. <br /> <br /> Still, for a sitcom, Bon Times ticks all the right boxes. If only shown this in the UK during the 80s. As it certainly is, as JJ would put it, 'DY-NO-MITE !! '<br /> Rating: 8 and a half
