This film is the first of six blind eagle guinea pigs and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who has been captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. A man from the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and includes a manga video, showing the tortoise. Those who capture it test the human limits before they die. Some scenes are shocking, as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking as the girl has drawn 100 times, because you see punches in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of Gore so I would recommend this to those 17 or more
