Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when it first televised in 1971. Scene scene delayed in my memory and a general feeling in my heart is how I remember being affected by it. I would be fascinated to see him again, if he ever made available for their home video .. Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic drawings and characters might emerge from a British movie 1960, original titled Dead City, hotel horror hotel for American release? There are also some similarities in a later British film Wicker Man. A detail stays with my years after seeing the movie. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the movie. As I remember, a minister and his wife stopped helping some people along the path, about 1870, somewhere from the West. Friendship looks like Ray Milland introduces himself to his daughter, Yvette Mimieux, a pretty young mute woman. While the philosopher is helping Ray Milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake slithers to see and reel menacingly, unobserved by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. It does not look frightening at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration until it goes. With this little weird moment, we already realize there is something very weird about these normal folks, though the possible danger the minister and his wife remain vague and uncertain for a long time. Stay with me clear after all these years, along with many others. The film has a high quality haunt on it that will not let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so clear. One must make this available for home video!
