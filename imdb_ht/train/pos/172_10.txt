I saw this film on Comedy Central a few times. This movie was very good. It is an exciting adventure with the life of Davis Sunny, who arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the U.S. can get a military base to have power balance in the Middle East. There are some good jokes, including "Sunnygate." I also just liked the term to finish. He gave me great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
