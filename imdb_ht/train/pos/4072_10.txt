Hayao Miyazaki name became important and Spitied Away, however what is often neglected is the first movie directors' efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg led Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last minutes of late 80s and stuck with me was the visual lushness of the cartoon and animation. So when I found a copy of a well-known store for Â£ 9 I could not resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie are not tally and my memories of it (memory is funny way). Seeing this movie now and all the knowledge has come to landing in art portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the work is. I can only assume some influence here. When Pazu captures a falling girl (Sheeta) adventure she really starts - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift overlooking the Gulliver tour. With the health bench of Jules Verne it's a basic good vs bad movie chase with the final portion of the heroes ending on Laputa. This is the most potent portion of my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa back to nature - the crowd of robots covered in moss under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanized underground. Even though this is the dichotomy of this movie - they show that even technology can not overcome the nature - the irony of the last robot to handle the field and the animals. Finishing the silent film silhouette is almost exactly the same. <br /> It's incredibly stylish, I would not say 'Slick' - very beautiful and organic with a tremendous amount of details in the building, airship and the design and look at just about everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie with her treasure.
