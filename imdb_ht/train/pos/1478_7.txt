I loved this movie, despite half of it, I could tell who is the secret admirer. <br /> I also wonder if it was based on a true story since it was said about the "real" people at the end of the movie. I guess I'll have to research it and let it know. <br /> <br /> Can anyone remember that this state has passed through? I believe they are moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> The state of the course could change to protect the innocent. <br /> You would think that the man could have calculated it out as easy as I did. Was it stupid or what?
