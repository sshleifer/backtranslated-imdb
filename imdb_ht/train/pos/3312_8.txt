After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in Gypsy TV version, Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTER MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a Live Concert Live Record for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who has been living on stage since the 1970s, proves that he is still one of the most electrified performers living in the business. From your open number, its classic "Friend", where it descends from the wings above a beautiful cloud, Bette commands the scene with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called "I Look Good" and then , proves that it has a way of joking as some other performers in this business as it segues its way through a variety of music selections. The section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long, but she managed to incorporate her old mate Sophie Tucker here in good advantage (though she actually forgot one joke in the middle of saying it but announcement it-delivery until he remembers it is hysterical). Bette also treats us in the "Turn the Rose" from Gypsy and tune in the title from his smash movie to Rose as well as a cynical plug for his hit film First Wives movie. He brought the house down near the end and "Stay with me, baby" from the Rose and read only # 1 hit records, "Van under my zeal" from BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.
