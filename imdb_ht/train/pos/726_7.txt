Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal - evil Ms. Togar (Mari Woronov). It intends to ban rock and roll music all along. She is pregnant with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves the Ramones. Also the top of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) may not seem to connect with any girl - not realizing Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with her. <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was set in general released and almost immediately bomb - but as a midnight movie it was a great hit and kept playing all in the 1980s. I remember going to more than some of those when I was in college - it was like a party! People were singing along with singing, laughing uproariously in every joke and generally just having fun. <br /> <br /> See it now as an adult I can not imagine why I loved this much. The script is juvenile and full of sorrow that I could not believe I heard. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What this save is some really funny lines and wonderful performances by Sol and Woronov (who really enjoy himself). Everyone is all energy and plays the role of the WAY on the top (as would be). As for the Ramones ... I was never a fan. I do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you could give this a higher rating. <br /> <br /> PROFILE WHOLE !!!! This is especially for kids (it has a rating PG) that will probably find it funny, but fun. I especially think that they will love the end when the high school is blowing! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> So if you're in the mood for a funny movie movie from the 1980s you would like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.
