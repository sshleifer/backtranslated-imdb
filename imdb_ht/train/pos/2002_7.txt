To a certain extent, I actually loved this movie much better than the original vampires. I found that the films must be quite misogynistic. As a woman with a horror fan, I used to the fact that women in danger are a staple of the genre. But they just slap Sheryl Lee around way too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a more fully-accomplished character, and the main bad guy is a gal! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick wave of armies) is very otherworldly and very dangerous. Jon Bon Jovi ... Well, yes, no big actor, but it does OK. At least it does not start singing. Catch it on the cable if you can. It's about Encore Action this month.
