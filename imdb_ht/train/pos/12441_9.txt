This was Modesti that we did not know! It was the hint and summary of the comic strip for the unions to sell newspapers! Lee and Janet batchler were true Blaise modest fans who gave the dream job - say a prequel story of Modesty that fans have never seen before. In the audio comments, they admit that they have made changes in their origins to make the story run smoother. "Pure" should also remember that we really do not know if everything he said Miklos was true because he was "stalling for time." I did not rent or borrow the DVD as other "reviewer" did, I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I watched it three times and I did not sleep in it! Great dialogue with well-traced characters that I care about (even bad guy Miklos) just like in the novels and funny comics! I also can not wait for the upcoming Modesty movie (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
