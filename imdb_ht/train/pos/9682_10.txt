I absolutely love this movie! It was SO good! This film was told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie gives Marie the girl as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and become the best friend. But when Paulie says Marie flew, she dropped and sent the bird away. That's when the adventure starts. Paulie goes in great numbers to find her way back to Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, touchy, sad, and more. When I first looked at this movie, it caused me to cry. The courage and urge to go to Marie her for all this time, was so touching. I must say that the finish is so sweet and sad, but you'll have to look it in to find out how it goes. In the end, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story. Will she get her Marie lost or not? Find out when you watch this sweet, hearty movie. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
