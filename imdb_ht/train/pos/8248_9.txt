When you see the cover of the DVD you are convinced this is some cheap B Cheesy class, a movie made for $ 1,000 in someone's yard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a clever at that. It is also very touched in spots, and a beautiful task of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (this looks excellent), the actors are known, the movie direction and the sets are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, playing counter-quality, is terrific, like "Helen Robinson," wife of June-Cleaver-like; Billy Connolly is great as the good-hearted zombie grunting "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a neighbor is the neighbor and sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy," and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as their father (checks) are excellent, as well as K'Sun Ray as young "Timmy Robinson," should not be overlooked, either. In fact, it probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. <br /> If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that some of you would watch it. You will just have to take the word of the people here who loved him and find it to be a very, very beautiful surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.
