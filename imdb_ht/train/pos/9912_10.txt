Absolute wonderful drama and Ros are top teeth ... I highly recommend this movie. His performance, in my opinion, was Academy Award material! The only real sad reality here is that Universal has not seen it that this movie has ever been available on any video format, whether it be tape or DVD. They are ignoring a very good movie. But Universal has little regard for its libraries on DVD, which is sad. If you get the chance to see a place (not sure why it is rarely even running on cable), see it! I will not go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the movie, and too much "reviewed" than hours written on the story, available anywhere. !
