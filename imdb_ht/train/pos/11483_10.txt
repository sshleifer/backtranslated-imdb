The thing that makes this movie so scary is one way that it shows Andrew and Calvin as (relatively) normal guy. These are definitely not those who want to become creative filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera, forgetting scripted lines, etc. They only make the video as a diary to show their 'survivors' how normal their lives were. Parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video. Do not research other kids' attacks in schools, Andrew and Calvin learn what not to do with them to inform (usually in an unusual way 'Old House' way) any potential 'Andres and Calvins' that might watch this video in how to make bombs, get guns, and do not get caught before zero day (the day of the attack).
