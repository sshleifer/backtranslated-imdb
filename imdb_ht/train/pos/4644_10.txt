Flat out the funniest parody of the art pretentious house ever made. <br /> This flicker exposes all the clich√©s, and then some! Bad Accusations (Downs-Syndrome!) Actors. Terribly heavy self important dialogue. Scenes that should be shocked but fallen flat. Jarring editing. Point Trace Point. All wrap up in a kind of melas smasky in disrespect for the audience and cycle-driven waves. <br /> It's exactly what he's been doing. A hilarious satirist in these tedious movies made by spoiled young-founders, showing parents when asked what they did for the last two years! After "What is it?" received his Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have said that the movie was in fact a parody, in part of his own movie! It supposedly was blown up in the information. At that day he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, seeing it with laughter, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.
