The comedian commissioner of William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murderous mystery, which has one of the most unusual and easy cemetery ever. Powell is probably the most capable detective in the 30's, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a tiny bug succession. They are very pleased to look, so take the brashness of the plot with a single tablet and just enjoy seeing it unfold. Eric Blore also has some funny turns as Butler Powell's. Powell's deal with MGM included a clause that allowed her to reject being lured from another studio, but she wanted to work with Arthur and she liked scripting, so she rushed accept the placement. They worked together in 1929 Paramount Movie, the case murder case with the Greater Murder case, both in the Philo Fly series.
