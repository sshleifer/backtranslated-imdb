I saw this first movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and still my crap. The muppets are so cool and approach to show business in a horrible naive way. My favorite scene is when rats start a jarring campaign named Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is one smart and funny movie movie for kids and parents alike. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
