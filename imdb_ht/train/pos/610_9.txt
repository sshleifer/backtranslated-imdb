Although Stardust seems to have a fantasy and predictable movie finish with average performance, it is certainly not. When I saw the movie, I knew he was going to be one of my favorite movies. And I was good. <br /> <br /> Stardom is more of a fairy than an adventure movie. It has this magic 'Aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. The storyline is well written, and it holds you on the edge of your chair. Like all history, it has some short morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that bad brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that the true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl is deep and manipulative. <br /> I must give Claire Extra Claire Danes extra credit. It literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this shining fit perfectly in her character. In addition, he and Cox do have chemistry that make the romance of the film even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses of course making Stardust an exciting and high ranking movie '<br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is fabulous, the magic places and the interesting scheme .I was very disappointed that the movie did not get nominated for more awards. I must give at least 9/10 stars for that.
