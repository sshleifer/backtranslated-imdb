I remember seeing that when he was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and did not wait a lot. I mean - an Australian movie? But it finally happened to me. Here's a scene. Richard Chamberlain who crosses the diaper on the floor of a ragged apartment in Sidney, facing an elderly Aboriginal Australian named Charlie. '<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who are you? Who are you? ... Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? "She is a stunning scene, full shot of closed ups, and Blandly's cute face face the Chamberlain to fill the screen in the Black Charlie's opposition, broad-nosed, crimson face. <br /> <br /> The two guys could not be more different with this movie is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally falls into its humdrum existence's existence of inexplicably, almost unspeakable, the mysteries of Charlie's world. <br /> I do not think I'll go over much about the plot. It's kind of a apocalyptic story. But I must say, anyone who did research on Australian Aboriginal belief system should get a plus. They had everything in here, out of bone show in the dream time, a kind of parallel universe in which the real dreams. It is a very spooky movie without any keen music or splendiferous special effects. Charly's world simply begins to intervene in Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons never made entirely clear. <br /> If there is a problem with the script, that's it. There is nothing that has ever been made clear. Is Chamberlain, which seems to have some extraordinary reports and Aborigines, died in the past wave? Are Aboriginal? Are all the Sidney? Particularly basic is a little hard to accept too, even if it is granted that this is a fantasy. Aborigines are investing with the quality of American power given by Americans, while the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one can be more complex or satisfying - most elegant and beautiful, if you love - mythology is always a try transcends an ordinary, requires, and sometimes irritating physical existence. The Charlie Mysticism is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille in the "Ten Commandments," but they are bruising the skin. <br /> But I do not care about that. Taken as a movie, this one is very good, and it's especially important to mark the celebrity of the director, Peter Weir, and the Australian movie industry. This was the first of a huge wave of films in the antipodes, some of them rockets, such as "Mad Max," and some subtle and dramatic, such as "Lantana." I like the Weir's stuff, similar to Nicholas Roeg's in being pregnant and subliminal. Try the "hanging rock picnic" for an example of how to make a really cool movie that is not a drop of blood.
