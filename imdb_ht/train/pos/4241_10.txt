I loved this movie !!! Characters were people that you might feel for. The young man returned from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is still perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. Her realistic as it was dead for the eye of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as her feelings for her were playing very well. The rest of the original characters in the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. The most touching scene however, was the young couple in his grandfather's house. I laughed in the party, calling to some and enjoying watching this movie. In fact I was re-looking at it about 5 times. A definite must be seen for total romanticism.
