It's a great movie. I sowed that some people think this can not be based on a true story. No matter what !!, the movie is great, and all you can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying into the mermaid town and so on, rather thinking that "a girl wants to come true "and this means that all of our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in ourselves and make all people in this world do them. The little girl (Desi - in the movie), with her mother, were the best actors I saw in a long time. Good for them, for all actors, all for the director. If anyone can tell them, please tell them, "A 25 year guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie."
