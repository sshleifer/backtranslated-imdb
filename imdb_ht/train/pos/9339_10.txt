For those of you who are not referrals, clubberin was 4 points hit one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyways, on the review. <br /> I miss WCW Saturday night. Some of my favorite fighting moments took place on this stage. I remember watching Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP on his work day, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I should be here Here's a list of all people. Points are WCW having an awesome list of the days before Hogan and producing funny TV. Dusty Rhodes on the Book it later years gave me a whole new reason to look when I started to smack skin as a teenager ... I really want Vince to put it on the micro for a show or two, Maybe the next Great American Bash? Yo CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! It was great. <br /> -DirrTy
