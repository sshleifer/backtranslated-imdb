BASEketball is a very funny movie that delivers act that generally makes the film much funnier, comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny, with a very good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers vs. the poor guy rich.You in and the only thing I do not like about BASEketball, was that kid was not really needed in the movie, but if the kid was not in the movie, some of the comic scene would not exist. read any pro reviews on this movie, exclude them all because basically all the reviews did not like this movie.BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
