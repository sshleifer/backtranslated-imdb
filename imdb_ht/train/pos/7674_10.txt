I had the privilege of watching "Holly" at the Film Festival of Edinburgh last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12 year old Vietnamese girl who sells prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes to Holly's life and decides he wants to help him. When Holly sells again, Patrick desperately searches for her. We follow are hard trips to Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of kids selling and trafficked every day. The movie shows this difficult problem without crossing the line. I went away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and wondering how can I help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it expose a problem that we should not ignore again.
