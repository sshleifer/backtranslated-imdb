I had to see this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw her at B & W on the PBS local station. <br /> I bought a DVD set for kids to see, and I made them look. They do not teach stories at school, and explain the most critical events in the 20th century. It raises critical thinking.

Watch it with them and make them understand. You'll be so happy you've done.
