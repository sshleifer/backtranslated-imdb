I researched this movie a little and discovered a website that claims it was actually a joke inside the world WWII Greenwich Village in gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, warlocks and witches represent that alternative life. John Van Druten who wrote the play stage was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in the 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that did not include horses, machine guns, or foreign monsters and I planned on being bored. But I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and threw his hat off while the camera followed his turbulence. As the glorious power of George Duning likes to rise, I suddenly got a sense of what she felt like falling in love. The first romantic / sexual love stirrings left me sad as I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not just the pre-teen boy who was impressed by amazing Kim, Novak's gaze direct. It's ironic that a gay parable could jump-start heterosexual growth in many of us. I am at the end of my 50th now and re-viewing last night's films and those same feelings as I watched the hat to touch down fifty years later. . .
