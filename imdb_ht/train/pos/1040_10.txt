Outstanding film in 1943 and Paul Lukas provided an Oscar performance to calibrate as the head of his family brought back to America from Europe as the Nazi threat deepens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Lukas successfully deals with the situation. He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return it to do so. Davis again pulls all the stops with a Katharine Hepburn-like asleep in tears when to be part. Resolve, she knows that her older son, must follow him on his way to freedom. A wonderful movie about American propaganda positive against a wicked foe.
