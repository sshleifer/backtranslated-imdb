It's a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love. Personally, I never run on such a twist-off story in real life. But I can image there. <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" of the title. But after I watched it, I did not receive this feeling of "illness" that I would probably have regarding the rules of society. It's a nice thing in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not contradict using any moral or social rules. The film focuses primarily on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and finally ends. You feel the moment when love flowers, the first murmurs, touch. You feel the connection. And there is no moment I though this is immoral. You even hope he will not break at the end .... it can not break ... it's bad. You feel the pain for breaking breaking in the end ... <br /> But I also need to add a negative turn to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * has shown * gives the feeling that these relationships are ill only in form, but not in content. You do not have the total story, but only fragments. When films started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So there is no sign of the nature of the relationship. You feel only a tension between them ... a fight between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line of Kiki Sandu says: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do as I ask you." This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is moral ... and where the boundary between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquering all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this film is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
