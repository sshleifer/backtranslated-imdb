Atlantis was better than I was anticipating. In some ways she had a better story than coming to the other films aimed at a higher age. Although this movie has demanded a solid attention span at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed some of the lesser audience expecting a comedy, but there was an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parody. A lot of these kids do not see anything but parody. After a while everyone seemed very intense to watch Atlantis.
