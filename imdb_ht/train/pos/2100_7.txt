Before joining politics or utility, Glenda Jackson was one of Britain's finest films. This film shows her talent despite having a support role in a stellar cast including Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of a British Royal capital who lost her memory in the last 20 years, and Jenny played by American Ann-Margret in an almost roles recognized as the doting sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the trauma shock during the Second World War. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treats her. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne, and Frank Finlay. You can not help but watch Glenda play a dowdy housewife with the first love of the Captain but from different classes. It's not the greatest movie but it's good to see the amazing glenda's talent. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Gray a likable character and you see why a Regal commander falls in love with her.
