Undoubtedly the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performance by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spyware), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, Real Name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence Controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' father) and Alan Howard (Jack Fraternity, Magnus' , Believers and British controllers), and the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, those responsible for their filing should have been awarded a premium. Even the small parts, like Membury Major, are perfected. He says a lot for the power of their performance, with the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the Magnus duplicity, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack Brotherhood and slip the Grant Leader of Intelligence US. I read the book at least a dozen times, and watch the movie almost as many times, and continue to be embraced by both. If I had a book taken on a desert island, A perfect spy would be the choice above everyone else.
