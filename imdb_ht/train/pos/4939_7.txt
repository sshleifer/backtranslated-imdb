This movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. It feels like an indie movie made from a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays herself, although the director swore the script was not written for her. And there is little boy in the actor who goes to a supermarket to search for a movie that he has not been engaging in again. I mean, he actually makes the movie in the end and we're watching it :) <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, but refreshing though. This is a movie that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go. A bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a nice little movie, made in two weeks, with the fundamentals of actors and a few extra, driving dialogues, making Morgan Freeman look good :)
