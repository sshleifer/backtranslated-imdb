The story of the FBI, as said from the Silver Agent pointpoint via Flightback, tied up with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (like his wife) are very good, as is Hamilton as a reliable agent. The problem is that the epicenter nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like looking bits and pieces of a dozen different cinema as we get glimpsed at someone who's thrown into gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school sequel). In general, it goes on too long road. But it's worth a look for its beautiful production value.
