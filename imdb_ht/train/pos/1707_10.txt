This movie is not for everyone. You are either bright enough to get "read" or not. Fans of sci-fi films that do not take themselves too seriously will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate parody and parody. Everyone I recommended this movie enjoyed it. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movie, you'll probably enjoy this one. The voice characters in a language-in-the-way and one-material fly fast and furious.
