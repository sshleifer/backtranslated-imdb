And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I would pay for her and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which, for all that I know, could do when he spoke Russian in this movie. All four of the directors are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and best scenes held together by nothing. While one is still ready to stop disbelief while watching a movie, this one requires too much of the viewer. <br /> It could be very funny (which it is in part) or quite scary (which it is in one scene) but the director did not seem to know which way to go.
