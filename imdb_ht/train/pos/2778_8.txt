I've seen that with some expectations and absolutely loved it! Folding it as Beckham is a typical fairly-come-of-movie movie about a pretty atypical girl. This is the role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England held between her traditional American family and her love of football (which in our North American football). And even though it's actually much more than its character, it plays the role-pitch-perfect role. This is a film about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), his teammate who will also be through family issues, especially with his mother, who wear purple polish nails and small bow His shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lacy pants and small toys and boys and is afraid that sports play means his daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love playing the game and having trouble trying to persuade their families to let them go after their dreams. They also, unfortunately, both love the same - Joe, the coaches (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Love's triangles cause some strain of their friendship. <br /> In some spots, Bend it as Beckham falls into clich√©. In others, the scenes dragged on far too long, and this movie probably could benefit from tightening in general. <br /> But this was a fun entertainment movie about growing up, clashing culture, and the love of football. It's autonomous girl, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. Funny, good and fun, bend it like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
