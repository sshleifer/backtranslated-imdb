For those who love the murderous mysteries, this is definitely the one to see, as it is full of interesting characters and suspects, most of them rich Long Island social qualities. As the star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspiring, behaving at times as if he and his costume went to cleansing products and were pressed together. Mary Astor is very beautiful here. Powell has done a career from playing the lead character, Philo Vance, in a series of cinemas made in a couple of studios over many years. In between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead, at times even explained the role of gangster guys. Already at middle age, he was stuck in a bit of a career Rute by the time this one came along. As with many early talkie stars, it seemed that his time had come and gone, that it was good for early film depression, but this and changing time was probably too mature and dandyish to keep. <br /> <Murder Murder Case, directed by Michael Curtiz's criminal negligence, is one of the latest in the "old Powells", while the next year would be announced in the first of the new ones, The slim man, the success of that would catapult its leading players in the Hollywood stratosphere. In the courtyard we can see the movies always in a ritualized model restyle, as the camera does not move much, and the act, like the presentation, is occupying the theater. There is no harm in this approach, though, which has its charm. He gives the film a baroque quality.
