This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies in his style. The interplay between respectable and morally strong characters is a knight of honor and code of honor among robbers and policemen. It deals with terms such as homework, guilt, word, manipulation and confidence as some films have made and, unfortunately, no one I can remember since the death of 'policemen' in the late sixties. The sequence is delicious, down to the bulk, living there is nothing out and consequently leading the spectator to a masterful and evil mastermind without eye catching accessory and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller genres of genre in order to keep the audience awake. No scenes are present or needed. The argument is the spectacular sand of the spectator; An important advantage of a genre that often leads to suspicion of the deception of the audience. No, this does not miss Marble ... A note of congratulation for the music is in order of a movie to watch and taste every minute, not just to see.
