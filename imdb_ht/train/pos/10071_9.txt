When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skill and magic about in an heiress, unusual and very proud street scene, known to all as "the King of Mask," becomes desperate for a young adolescent apprentice and cultivated. It's warm and humane, it's getting paid a few dollars for a child who is displaced by China's natural disaster, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930s. Getting his new, 7 year old boyfriend, on his landscape booth, lives with his precious and beautiful monkey, "General," only to discover that he is the child of a child. Life is instantly transformed, as the love it feels for this little slave girl gets entwined into the stupifying tradition that requires her to pass her art on only to a young man. <br /> There are many stories inside this one ... many people are touching, and China's culture is opening itself up for our eye to observe. Thousands of years of heirloom boil down into a whirlwind of drama, and some will leave this back DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The transfer technique itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the master, and it can actually see video transfer lines in various parts of the movie. Very recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
