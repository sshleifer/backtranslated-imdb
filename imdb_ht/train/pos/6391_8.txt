They took this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect a lot (though the festival director told me he was one of the best films to submit). Five minutes from it I was selling. The B & W shot on a shoestring budget, this movie is hilarious. The act is solid, the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. The act is probably the biggest revelation, since most films on low budget tend to have amateur or acting stagey. Not this one. It features one of the most compelling, endearing and funny portraits of a character and Tourette Syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is complicated without being confused with raunchy without being free. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Creators like Majkowski (hoping I got the right thing) deserve the chance to keep things up at a wider audience.
