I just started watching TV series "What I love about you" and I must say is a happy look. I still like to see new shows doing well to consider a lot of shows before you really get a feel for them. I watched Amanda Bynes since "All That" it's really a funny girl, what is the best about her comedy is her natural and what I mean about who is, her something that someone could Here is the best friend she says, she does not repeat. <br /> I just recently started watching the show and fell in love. I'm just watching re-run as of now, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give something in the whole story line. It's nice to see some old figures in other shows I enjoyed watching in the past as Jennie Garth's "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular", and Wesley Jonathan from "Guys City." The new character is very talented as well, Nick Zano has the charm that makes you love her even when doing something wrong with Holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall this show contains the right ingredients to be successful, I look forward to watching it grow.
