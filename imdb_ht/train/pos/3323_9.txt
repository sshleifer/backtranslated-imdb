I got this movie about a month ago and I'm now a fan fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending with this film giving a brilliant one and the truths of the Red Sox dish! It is about a math teacher who takes some promising kids on a math trip to a company where Lindsey (Drew) has shown some information. This then leads to the Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it is not all simple when he acknowledged that he is a massive Red Sox fanatic. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's good, but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindsey's life. It's all fine in the end and it takes one shot to get Drew running across the field !! I got it for the quid of Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like films like this I suggest you see some more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new films and Hugh Grant in Calling Music and Lyrics.
