Excellent, pre-cordial story story with Barbara Stanwyck as the inspiring (not written in Nietzsche!) To drive out her sensitivity and exploit herself, use the male to benefit her. Not really just about the German philosopher but interesting that this Hitler's years came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much to me but it certainly does well here, ever driving herself and the movie forward. Not as much meat on display here as one might expect but many risky and amazing looking and innuendo situations. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I would believe in all honesty by a very beautiful view of gold digging women. Still life is alive!
