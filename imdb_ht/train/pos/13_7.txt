Good quality production, cast, quotes, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) Locating and lush John Williams notes should cause a 3-4 star collector item. Unfortunately, all we got was a friendly 2 star "decent" flicker, especially memorable for what he tried to do ......... bringing a home style home indices. The local premises and ordinary people's stories are a genre of self, and if well done, they will meet most grownups. Jane Fonda was able to hide her brain enough to make her character credible. I wonder why he did not do a post doctor in Yale instead of working on a dead end job in Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was just a bit too confusing. An illiterate, good negative guy who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. This genre was most successful occupied by "Foolish" in the mid-1990s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt." I wish that the main stream studios would try more for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens in the multiple cinemas complexes for these efforts. <br /> I'll give him an "A" for effort.
