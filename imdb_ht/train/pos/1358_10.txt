Seasons after season, the players or characters of this show appear to be those who you would absolutely love to hate. Are they showing this show to be what or they chose for the same? Every episode delivers one person specifically and ends up getting to kill. You enjoy seeing them get sick although it's totally wrong and sick. You enjoy seeing them fucking others, getting screwed up, playing room, getting it back, escaping and finally getting kick out of Trump. The number of water is also likely to increase by the season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that try to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also heavily reduced. In the shortest seasons, it's like "You get to meet xyx that will be your lecture on uvw" .. like that freaking trouble? The characters are so hateful, collectively and individually, asking if they're paying actors? Only the list has gotten. <br /> Look carefully and keep an awareness. These are your fellow humans in the shooting line.
