This is the latest Dutch film film Paul Verhoeven made before going to Hollywood's mainstream film "Basic Instance," "Robocop," and "Total Recall," among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching her internet cats before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying self-centered writer and a morbid imagination. Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting at sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to glimpse into how Gerard's imagination twist reality. I ask if the writers a little close to folly he admitted when he read the newspaper "and said 'boom' I read bankruptcy, 'saying' flood 'I read' bloody, 'when saying' red 'i see 'dead.' "When he tells a story enough time he begins to believe it; "I lie the truth." It accepts an offer to be invited to the night of the Club treasurer, a beautiful wealthy salon owner. As she gets to know her and learns her husband died, she starts to imagine she is 'a black widow.' Is that more him in twisting his reality or is he a murderer? This is a psychological drama and in telling which of these old films were stuck in my memory, I figured that is my favorite sex. Looking at his body in his work seems to be Paul Verhoeven's too, and he is a master of making us our own understanding of reality. It's a nice change at the pace of Hollywood's normal fare. I saw him in 1983 and he is a movie that "sticks."
