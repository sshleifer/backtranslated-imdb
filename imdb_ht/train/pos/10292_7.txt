Let me start from saying I'm a big fan of Carrey. Although I'll admit I did not see all of his cinema * magest * movies *. Bruce Almighty was enjoyable. None of the other comments really went to how his cheesy came towards the end, I do not know what the writers thought. Somehow I could not help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the Steve Correl Daily Show is HULARIOUS and thus is the rest of the cast. See Bruce the Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a light-hearted (soft music piano) a bit comedy comedy.
