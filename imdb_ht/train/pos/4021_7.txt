A complex story puts on the background of partitioning in Bharat. An honest Muslim who kidnapped an innocent Hindu girl, with an educated Hindu that burned the crop into a Muslim man - again at the end you end up liking them both. The story is powerful, yet the scenario and leak are reluctant. Background music notes and songs are exceptional. Next comes memorable acting by veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures time, violence, and tastes in rural Punjab very well. Others actors either did not act well, or did not get a chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. Characters have not developed properly. By dry, in the "Earth" deal, where even a 5-line character left a mark. The end is very interesting. This story might have several different finishes - and all of them could be equally good.
