This movie was more of a passage of manhood for a gay man, and how it should deal with everyone. Her mother is depressed, her younger sister is a pain, her older sister is a bit accepted. The relationship looks good with her companion / exhooker and leaves her family trying to make life with this guy first. Unfortunately, the new guy screws around on her and says she really does not mean anything. Our gay young boy goes to the finals and ends up in the loune bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting on. We left with him starting over and watching, not participating, in happiness. So maybe things will go better for him in the future. The finish was the kind of a Downer but the movie was entirely realistic and so I'll let this real end up slipping by a high rating.
