Nice character development in a cool cool environment. Being a male, I probably do not fully comprehend it, but doing a great job in establishing the restructured Victorian environment from the start. It is not as weak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even tougher. What to do this goes is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has its own "things" that is supplied with them. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the trench spider, they begin to communicate and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that she did not go for cheap comedy when she could win. He did not try to book a lesson from us. Those who seem completely without merit are really nicely developing human beings who get to see the light. I had a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina who has such a epiphany quickly, but in this world, he needs to happen. Good to act all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some very good people.
