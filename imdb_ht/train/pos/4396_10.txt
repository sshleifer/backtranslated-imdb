I really enjoyed the details of the script. Jonathan Rhys Myers (mishaps) and jewelry were outstanding in their support roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire has given as fine a current job as she has ever been, when she empowers her best friend, knowing she would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, and good coaching trains to catch the South accent incredibly well. <br /> Why this movie was swept under the carpet by the Hollywood developers I can only imagine. I have great suspicion. Which makes it all the more appealing to me. I donated a dozen duplicate DVDs out there. <br /> Completely neglected film. Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.
