I just saw "in human bondage" for the first time a few days ago with WOW! What a mysterious and almost spooky movie. I liked how the music went with the pace at every step of Philip's feet. It gave me the thrills for some reason ... <br /> One of the greatest aspects of this movie is that you get to see Bette Davis coming to his head right before your eyes. It's great, not necessarily because this is his best job, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, fearless, and unflinching as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risky person, always Wishing they are different and this is right about when it began to realize that it might be as nasty and daring as he wanted and who would love it for her. If you're a true guy in the movie, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> It just had a way of delivering a line that belonged to, and the movie for that matter, belong li. Like "A mass of music and fire. I am ... an old boo and some sparklers" or "Here you are Blanche, you are in that chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEARTS, I still love the man I did !!" ... Those are from a few of its films, but you get my drift. It was just brave, sassy, ​​and exotic looking with these beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe she was remade twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was gorgeous ... so calm and persistent, which needs to be loved. I thought he was adorable and could not understand how everyone did not fall for him, but then again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that I did not like was something that was common and written in the early films. They would make a character so lovely that it's almost incredible that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. Their performance was great, but in real life, Philip would never be interested in Mildred. That's just the simple truth ... See it !!
