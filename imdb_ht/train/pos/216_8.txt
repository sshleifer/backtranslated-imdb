Question: How do you steal a scene from Walther Mathau's robbery stolen expert in full, furious and glamorous grumpy old fashion? Answer: slowly, deadpan, and perfect timing as George Burns does here. <br /> I know nothing of Vaudeville but this remains a favorite movie, the two drive hilarious, the funny script, the direction and the rhythm very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny as right man - trying to get into burns through the window etc. Even the small parties are great. <br /> <br /> There are many funny scenes, Mathau punishes the commercial, Burns repeats her answers as if senile ... <br /> <br /> A fun. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
