I thought that this film was stunning, with exceptionally outstanding performance by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cervi show Artemisia is so beautiful, and trends are always confidential, but it's out of mind before moving her model to location. The passion that Artemisia gives to his art is just spectacular to look.Even if not every character was overtly beautiful, this made the movie more realistic as the facial hair and clothes were perfect for this point in time I thought this movie was fantastic.
