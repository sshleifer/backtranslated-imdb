Those who gave this output as a low rating probably never saw the celebrity George Balanchine live performances, or to leave the chaos for the casting of stars in Macaulay Culkin to influence their judgment. Atlanta Ballet was fortunate enough, since the 1960s in the 1980s, the first ballet company must be authorized at this stage of production other than Ballet in New York City, and I've seen it live several times. I can assure readers that the film is a very accurate rendering of this production, and that the use of a child with limited dancing ability in the title role is not a cheap casket dreaming to show Culkin; Balanchine's idea was to use a child in this role, as he had the idea of ​​using a child for the role of Marie. The "big" dancing leaves the adults in the story. <br /> This is deliberately a movie at the scene; In a way, it looks like Laurence Olivier's "Othello". Exactly as in this movie, the sets of stage production have expanded the size of a movie scene sound but not made any artificial less, and the ballet is right to photograph with secret constraints, and without " music video "quick cut featured in 1986 by Maurice Sendak-Carroll Ballard version. There are only two false steps in this 1993 film. One is the addition of the sound effects of extract and completely unnecessary (squeaks mouse, kids whisper "Ma-gik!" To Drosselmeyer, etc.). These sound effects have never heard of any stage production of any "Nutcracker", and have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease sophisticated audiences that can not relish the idea of ​​watching a movie ballet. /> The other false step is Macaulay's Culkin's make-up, which looks absolutely ridiculous. When it is on the screen like the Nutcracker, rather than wearing a large mask (as is always done when the Balanchine play is played stage), Culkin is actually made up like the game - it wears what looks like a bald cap, as well as a white wig, mustache, and a beard. He also had his face mumbling up a bit, and the worst aspect of his make-up is that he still acknowledges his face, abruptly transformed in a similar way to Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr's makeup in the "Wizard of Oz" (which results in the movie's makeup though, worked spectacularly, as this one does not). And a comparison with Baryshnikov's nutcracker in his * production showed how beautifully creative Baryshnikov's nutcracker mask - the "jaws" actually seemed to move anytime Baryshnikov leaned back. The dance itself in the Maculay Culkin version is excellent, of course, except for Culkin himself, whose dance, as I said, does not mean to be even spectacular. (The Sugar Plum Fairy and its Rider are the important dancing roles in Balanchine's production of the "Nutcracker.") The film color, though, could be a bit brighter since this is a fantasy. The choreography is also brilliant, and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music in the ballet Tchaikovsky "Beauty of Sleep" - as Marie sneaks down, falls asleep on the sofa, and dreams that Drosselmeyer is " Repair the broken Nutcracker (this sequence, of course, is never included in Tchaikovsky's original ballet - is the only sequence in this production that features music from another job than the "Nutcracker"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It is far better than it seems when one first hears that Culkin is in it.
