I saw this film day it came out last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's about to video and I've seen it again. I like this movie! Things are sometimes mute, but that makes it the third favorite movie ever. Special effects are okay, but the witty dialect will have you rolling. I'm the kind of person who will say I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like plays and other things, avoid. But for everyone else, enjoy! The act is superb. Hank Azaria is under the best (it's neither a commission nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, do not correct me .. it's sick) and then William H. Macy delivering better performance It (outshining fargo) Everyone has praised everyone from mafia garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was very good as invisible boy. Two issues: The most boring part of the film is the romance subplot between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the Casanova presence audience. Some scenes absolutely advance the story in any way, but they're an explosion. Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene until all is hilarity away, but the booms change and you're ready for more. I swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the biggest explosive (which I think was very cool). The camera is also very cool, moving at an angry speed with the actors. Also, Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this cool cool cool hero) and as someone else says, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness. Captain Amazing is very funny, (especially his speech to Casanova on his perfect plan-I rolled) and hurry is pretty cool as Casanova. A beef: The funniest comedy ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty stars and hope that one day, everyone will see the shine of the best movie parody, Six Million Dollar Man in one. Praise now as I think about it. 20/10
