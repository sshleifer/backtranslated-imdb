The seven DVDs owned me until I just have to go out and buy it. This was one of those movies. Like so many over here, I remember seeing it as a child and liking it. I never knew there was a scene and music numbers that had been cut, so I was intrigued to see what they might be. I will agree that the section "Portabellow Road" is now a long tad (as is the soccer game) but other than that, I have not found any crime and the remaining scenes that have been put back into place. Perhaps Disney should have had the original version (which is the restore version) on one side and the version is restored on the flip side, then people can choose what they want to see. All in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories.
