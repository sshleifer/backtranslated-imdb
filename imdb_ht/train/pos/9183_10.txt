This wonderful 1983 BBC TV production (not a movie, as others wrote here) in the classic love story "Jane Eyre", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the finest version to date, since it is the most faithful in the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concepts and dialogues. <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific purposes; when film producers begin to interfere with a classical lifesplood a lot then classic is destroyed. Fortunately, these "Jane Eyre" producers came to the story with respect and loyalty towards the original, which resulted in a spectacularly addictive spectacle worth seeing multiple times, enjoying its multi-layered in sweet and fun and suspense. Their performances are succulent, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful and puts the right tone for the production. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! In today's modern world a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but staying with Rochester after finding she had a crazy wife and was still married to her. "Oh, just get a divorce", it would tell her man, or she would live in sin with her. But Jane Eyre knew she could not settle for this course of life with respect to herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of Christian faith taught since childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood institution, but in the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyred rather than by turning the other blow la. One day I would like to see some versions describing these influences slightly more fully in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with writing of heroine "Though, come Lord Jesus!" should not have the foundations of faith to strip out of it.
