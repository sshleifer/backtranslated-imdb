I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's film, especially the 1997 "Henry Crazy." "Grim Grim" is a sequel to that movie, and it has a style similar to sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Faulty Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) trying to dig his missing husband and find himself in the midst of conspiracy and espionage. Throw in support (most of the folks from the first movie as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a very-welcome return from the 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn) are excellent and the movie boasts of surprises. The principal claims this is part of a "Star Wars" such as trilogy, serving as "empire strikes back" in the series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope I do not have to wait 10 more years for her.
