This is one of those westerns that, well, stand virtually alone in the similar quality of its dialogue. Very few can hold up to it on the long haul. That said, the rest is very bad. But I give him an eight because there is no other west with these quality dialogs and maybe the exception of the wild bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps a few more. <br /> It's riddled with weakness, John Drew Barrimore is the most blatant. However he has a really memorable scene. There is nothing like it. His rights after Kid Wichita killed the sheriff, and went to place Jack Elams trying to goad him in a fight. Wonderful thing. Right up with the best of any west.
