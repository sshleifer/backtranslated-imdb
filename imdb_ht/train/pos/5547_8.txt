Strangler in the swamp made by PRC low budget studio and is certainly one of the best movies I've seen. A man hung for a murder and did not commit to return as a ghost for revenge on those accusing him. He uses a riot string his victim and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The old son took over the ferry itself and also fell in love with one of the local people and decided to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has very weak atmosphere, which makes it very creepy too. Strangler in the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. Excellent. <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars from 5.
