Take a break from running his escapist in the early 80's, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker in the "Purple", on the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg playing Celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who plays in movies like "Sisters Law". This is the movie sort that can easily be - no, doing what should be - part of the Curriculum of Black Science and Women's Studies. There is one scene that can be the most beautiful editing feature ever on the screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can not believe that this did not have an Oscar; it can be second-best movie playberg behind the "Schindler's List" (perhaps even tied to it). Also begins Danny Glover, Adolph Seza, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia, and Laurence Fishburne.
