When I was president of the coffee at our college, one of our work was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come together in 1972 was Groove Tube. The first original was that he showed off-off Broadway in theaters where TV monitors were placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a big seat. The first was that the skittles would change on a regular basis-Saturday night or Saturday, keeping the stuff cool. They decide on making it a movie for general distribution. <br /> I believe the developers said she was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. Watching her run naked even though the woods were crying. Like many of my previous reviews, it was Saturday night before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this blank. I told my 13 year old son about the Koko Clown-He can not wait to get a copy!
