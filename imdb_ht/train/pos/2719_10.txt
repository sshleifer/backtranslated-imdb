I saw this movie after looking at Capote and infamous. It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between authors and protagonists are sublime in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists have more beatniks than gay. The movie starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second, we get all kinds of interesting information from the writers' writers / directors created by Brooks. <br /> Notice the incredible incident at the start where the killers and their must-kill are linked. Cutter is on the phone-matched Perry phone on the phone. Cutter wash his face is matching-cut Perry to wash his face. Only Perry looking in the mirror and seeing eroticized her male body lying on a fantasy in playing her a guitar in Las Vegas empty chair. This failure / fantasy matches the fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it ever empty. <br /> <br /> Dick speaks about shooting fascination with the fact that the Donan Donans do not know that they will die. we cut off the Clutters. Perry spoke of his dream about a yellow bird, "higher than Jesus" that attacked the Nuns who were persecuted. "The nuns asked for mercy," he told us, "but the bird killed them anyway." The bird rose Perry paradise. Strangely, Perry says she has an abomination to Nine, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but he does not know who. The principal puts in all sorts of-ifs and only-ifs. Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep in a friend's house. It holds a horse. Perry is commenting on a photo of her and the house later on. Nancy can not sleep on his friend's house because her boyfriend is coming up for dinner. The decision seals his fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks at the Bogart "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But it is another Bogart picture, "Beat the Devil" that Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is McGuffin's. But Dick knows that the protagonists in that movie ended with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $ 10,000 he thinks is in Safe Clutter, (which ironically turns out to be as much as a fantasy as Perry's Mexican treasury. <br /> <br /> Cut into Clumber Herb Signs a life insurance $ 40,000 policy .. He thinks about mortality at this time .. Heronial mortality is over to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wants him a long life, yet ironic when we knowing what will happen in a few hours. <br /> Dick was told that they wanted no witness so nobody would remember them.Later, in fact, is because they eliminate all witnesses being remembered One Witness, "The detective kept saying later ... But witnessed friends in prison, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote, or God? The viewer gets the witness after watching the movie. <br /> <br / > Fascinating movie.
