- SMALL SPOILER ANKO! - When I watched the votes for "creep" today, I was amazed at IMDb's many rating users this movie "1". I ask: what people expect from such films? Are there many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a movie movie and it is a very good one! This automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous and simple one-side-character dangers. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your chair and then ... ... enjoy to be afraid of death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing other than Kate and a lonely train station are extremely hideous. There are suspense and fear of every corner of the screen, and you'll be given some strokes just because of a sudden sound in a bright neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion the sound editor did the best work of this film.) When Kate meets his peach quality in the movie drop but he still does not become a bad movie. The second part of the film is not frightening at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching and not the discovery chain!) so if you want to make yourself a very, very difficult time. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then leave the movie or turn on your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, not you? The bad guy will die and Kate will only survive. But even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push anxiety at the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the movie by night nights, go to the next train station and take the last train home ...
