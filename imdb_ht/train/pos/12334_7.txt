Anyone who came to know where this movie was shot? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It appears to be England. However, Ivy's apartment buildings certainly look like the Brill building, with its fascinating elevator. Charles Mendl is listed as playing "Sir Charles Gage". Perhaps I blinked, but I never saw him. Maybe she's husband's lawyer, but again, I do not remember that the characters were in the movie, other than being mentioned as she made a phone call. Perhaps it was at the aviation scene? Or the bullet scene? Is there anyone who stains it? Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when she shot this movie.
