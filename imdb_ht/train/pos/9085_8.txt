I see many postures really negative by those who wrote in August, even though the film was not released in the United States, at least until September. Perhaps those are happy visitors living in S. Korea who have seen it early. I am in the US and just see it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we all use this out of many other movies. It was not at all hard to follow. Acting in driving was weak, but others were good. There was humor at all, too. I rated it to 8 because I had a good time watching it, which is what I went for.
