Superbly develops character in many humorous situations full of spirits, absurdity and Serbian mentality. Movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, exciting, unpredictable. Best point in a movie: character, then humor itself, story and dialogue. Humor has 'interior development', rare in Serbian movies. So it is the consequence of characterization, is quite motivated, spontaneous and cogent. Also it is sharp, intelligent and sane. Most of the movies, unfortunately, built humor (eliminating a joke and putting it in the character's mouth) or ordinary comedy situation, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'immortality of art' are incorporated into this film. Little ruler, hardly came.
