I can not understand what it is that fans of the genre did not like about this movie. It was really a lot of fun. The special effects were beautiful. I generally agree with IMDB voting review, but not this time. I waited until he came home video I felt another reason I would not like the movie. I believe film special films need to be seen on the big screen, but yet this was not the case. For me the film was compared to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and Mom. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most supported movie ever. The mummy made gob of money and was worse. People loved it for its special effects. Movie like the mummy and the haunted by rich in character development, are more like entertainment rides. Well with that analogy Momi was a ticket to the Ha-Haunted ticket.
