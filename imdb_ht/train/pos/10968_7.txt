Gray Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just could not really look far. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick with ?????? .. really no words can describe. Move Gray Gardens are beyond scarce. I found out about this movie my Great Uncle John's Big Uncle, by the Institute of Bathing the Reader and it was well worth the rental and ball at the top of her movie watching queue. This movie is about all the most antics that have ever been filmed. One should look for her favorite Edie team, which I certainly include curtains. When I get old I almost want to be just like Big Edie, thumbing my nose to normalities and societies.
