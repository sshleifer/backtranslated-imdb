I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep on finding this movie stuck in my head. The Grinch loves Martha May, Cindy Lou (which's very annoying, her sweet innocence) that tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, Grinch's kids (very funny!), And yet the weakened end-to-end Christmas is not ' t all about presenting. I said, I felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of baby and toddlers laughing and doing, but this movie was a good full length adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages .
