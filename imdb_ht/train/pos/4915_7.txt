With a draw line rather unnecessary too-for the era: there is plagued the city of New Orleans-and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's trademark subjects: water, working people, crowds, fugitives, folk folk wheat, violence on a backstreet are all presented here. Jack Palance is quite effective as the cold mobster comes out for a great score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise is a bit miscast but certainly watchable as going. I loved Barbara Bel Geddes as a stalwart, cool wife-I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. He even reminds me of a bit of Sinatra-in the face and in the intense tranquil way-that is to say as a compliment if anything. I would never even hear from this movie, and yes, you have to admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas-it seemed to play this role many times, making an easy, efficient team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know it's not exactly the way it would have been in Real Life-rather small-scale in the least no - but I found he brings the draw together nicely. <br /> <br /> Check out this. It's good. *** outta ****
