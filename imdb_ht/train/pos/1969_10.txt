Frankly I do not understand why this movie was a huge "flop" of advertising. Sharon Stone certainly does not lose any of his charisma and "touches" since "basic instincts". I voted this movie 10 and I tell you why: open games in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events of BI1. Once again, he proves to be a mastermind manipulator in his own class - At least. It is "aiming your brain" as Catherine and such a skill that in the end you are not quite certain who is the real villain. As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate actor's crew. Sharon Stone is not only really great at the disposal compared to Michael Douglas etc. in the first part. I also think that BI2 would be better Sharon Stone was a bit lesser but it is still quite stunning in her looks and was only improving her charisma. B-rate "assistant" rate is not so bad although I want some major names in the cast. <br /> I think there is good improvement in the basic draw. I think this is a thriller beyond the Hollywood's run-off-to-the-mill so distribute these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you do not snore off the road half of the movie and most importantly -the Heath is over.
