"Incredible Man Fusion" is a fantastically gross, garbage and energetic Z-class production that every self-respecting campaign-horror freak simply saw for himself / herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70 to the gem is like a cynical copy of the Hammer "Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times filthier! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a space-mission disaster, but turns out the insurance company to a horrible illness that makes him radioactive and ... causing him to dissolve! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (you can blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a center of sticky hinges and falling on the rear part. Doctor Ted Nelson found him urgently, as the disease also put Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human body. Most of all, this movie may sound totally stupid but this movie is amazingly fun and has great make-up effects from Rick Baker. The dude's fusion face looks like a rotten and heavy pizza makes it sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs's scenario is not wasted anytime on tedious scientific or emotional explanation. The repulsiveness begins right away and lasts until the last moment in the movie. Just enjoy this great Horror gem and try to switch to your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating the many sorts of script, you will miss out on any fun in camp!
