it's amazing that many people I know have not seen this gem. Everyone I've been turning on has come back with the same reaction: WHAT IS A GREAT FILM !! <br /> I've never been much care for Brad Pitt (though her turn of 12 monkeys and club club improvements show) but her performance in this movie as a psycho is unnerving, dark and right on target. <br /> <br /> All others in the movie provide excellent performance and slow and deliberate slow down movie greatly improving the procedures. The essence of dread for the characters keep raising as they come to realize what has really happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that holds this out of a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it, the finish is a bit too long and overblown. but that's the only flaw I could get in this classic kil. <br /> <br /> If you check this movie out, try to get the unreliable crayfish director for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
