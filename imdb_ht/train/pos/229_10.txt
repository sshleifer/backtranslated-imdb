In today's world of digital fabrication, no computer than can replace the actor and writer. Alas, this type of "drive character" is far too rare these days. Duvall's performance as well as James Earl Jones are faithful to the great audience expectations. I wonder if this movie did for TV? He had a "pre-up" personal quality in the narrative. It is an understatement to say that their performance is all outstanding. The only thing that keeps it from being a movie director is the lack of a great cinematographer, but beautiful pictures are not everything. How talented love Jones and Duvall continue to produce these works well at an age where actors pose for the digitization?
