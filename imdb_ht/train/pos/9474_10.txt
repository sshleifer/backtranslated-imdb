I got to see this movie in a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can not remember being so hard in a movie and yet being moved by it. Laughs are not gags here - they are observations, laughs at recognition, shock of "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not give away the plot, which is more than just "Guy fell in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays part of the relationship here. Probably the best mix of laughter and heat since "While you were sleeping." Steve Carell goes far deeper than he did before, and for the first time I really love him. The cast is amazing, a list of actors theater veterans whom I loved in other roles, but they mix to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is beautiful as the mother, Juliette Binoche is glowing and hilarious (who knew it was funny?), And even Dane Cook's riot gives a warm, quiet, handling performance. Soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the second CD it's available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
