I have no idea why this flick of films is getting such a bad rap by many IMDb users (Some say it's 'worst movie ever.' What's the No You see the Cradle 2 Tomb ?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all in the action sequences. Duh! What is the crap you expected in a Jet Li Movie? Do you honestly believe that someone thought the story, then just loaded it with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action at its almost all running time. It's also delightful, and we have many cut branches, decapitations, and creative ways to watch the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!) Get killed. Most of other films It's martial arts are nursery schools when compared to Black Mask; no keep hold on the free violence, bloodshed, or any action sequel! And that made me a happy campaign. Once again: if you go to a Jet Film movie looking forward to nice dialogue with an intriguing plot, you will be for the wrong reason. Black Mask is probably my favorite in his movies (though, beware of the lurid dubbing).
