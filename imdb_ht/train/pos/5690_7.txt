Just watch this movie on DVD and think the act was pretty good, but over the whole story left a lot to be desired. This film has the same texture and looks panicked in Park Needles or cowboy drugs. Hard to believe that human beings can live this kind of life; on the underbelly of society, the total existence is based on the use of drugs, crimes, violence, gender, and a total lack of respect for yourself for anyone or anything, including themselves. Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role in "burn-out" former porn star John Holmes. Throwing in support is just as good. However, this is a weak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film. The assassination was brutal, but everyday life of these people was brutally as well. Unless you have an interest in these murder or being a "fan of John Holmes, this really is not a movie to see. If you want to see a document on drug trafficking, the 1960s Truman Capote In Cold Blood begins Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are better.
