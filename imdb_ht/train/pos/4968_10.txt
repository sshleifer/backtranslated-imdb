Diego Armando Maradona was, and still remains as the best football player, the game has to offer. Not only an athlete, but an artist. This documentary if the 1986 World Cup will live forever in the memories of every football fan around the world. Because of his tremendous and incredible goals, which he scored against my own country (england). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I dont undersand spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine tweeter. He's actually crying in happiness, and can barely express his emotions ..... Anything I wrote can be meaningful and hard to understand, but readers ..... do you have to watch this know what I mean .
