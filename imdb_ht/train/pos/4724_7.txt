Block: bury his alive brings us to a resort that has just opened, and is soon closed. <br /> We start with a guy in Covetine blowing up batteries, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that does not make sense. Anyways, it's about to blow away one one particularly great, when it is noticeable the resort is open. despite its best efforts, higher authority tells it its day is over. <br /> <br /> soon, as everybody hopes, an avalanche hit. <br /> <br /> Look, I will not reveal any more, all I can say was a B-movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw it on, and the fact it does not have any ads prove it to a B-movie) anyways, it's a very decent movie, but it's partially real. <br /> <br /> Seeds, when people are buried by ice and snow, are buried. Do not just trace the powder. or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? it is not possible. and finally, what I can not stress enough is that an explosion can not stop an avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> In addition, it's worth a rental or watching TV, but not always. 7/10. The movie is rated PG, but maybe it should have got something a little stronger. A boy almost loses his feet to an elevator, but his legs are cut off in the ankle, a guy is grilled by electricity and diesel, and in the room weight, the dead are laying around.
