I also saw this on its release in '56, and have been hit since then with its final scene. If this is a response to 'High Noon,' then it's apt and appetite. This note, as this string is ruled, the "city comes together" is a message stronger than the personal lonely crown of Midnight. In this term, 'Concho' is a phenomenal precursor to one of my other ever-favorites, 'Magnificent Seven.' Both Sinatra and Conrad provide impressive and convincing performances, especially the transformation Sinatra from burlying kid kid liberating the city's savior. I can only hope that at some point all friends and family over whom I have been influencing my affection for this film will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
