The Little Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the future, Arnold's star as Ben Richards, a wrongly condemned man in the 'Running Man' play, a very dangerous TV show game where people have kept moving to try and survive brutal death in the hands of the 'Stalkers'. Of course, people must die eventually and get up to Arnold to prove the wrong system. <br /> I do not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie, regardless of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the role of man's actions, delivering deaths and unforgettable one-covered materiaries. The classics are probably 'It's been a real pain in the neck' after tasting a guy with barb's wire, and 'It's cracked!', Referring to where it's just a chain to see someone vertical. Dawson is perfectly disappointing as the TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' is decently campaigned. The action is violent, but it's a movie action. That's the point. The movie is fast paced, and in 90 minutes it does not overstay its welcome. <br /> With Starsky and the Hutch Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and made in the successful wake of the Terminator, this film has already been seen as another mindless action machine for Arnold, and far looking. But today, anyone who watches a lot of television could see how the film is getting closer to reality. I would not be surprised if I turned to the TV in 'near the future' and saw a show away from this. <br /> <br /> On that depressing note, I must however recommend the 'Man to Run' for anyone who loves the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
