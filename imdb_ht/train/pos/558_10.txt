Classic drama / western action and incredible cinematography that is well ahead of his time (1954). The production is good and you can say that he's done with pride and love. A look at the American Indian pioneer WEST is very educative and entertaining. This film is pretty much under rated because most people do not like to see the fact that many "legends" during this particular time and place have been very crooked / corrupt as many of today's developed countries. The sequences of actions could be more realistic though but still, this film really covers most of the essentials .Not for a hearing that only the most tiptorms testoterone tip for this movie is more for people with a sense of history and philosophy .......
