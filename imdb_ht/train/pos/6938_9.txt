For the viewer who comes over it long after it's done, "Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca." While you look at it, you get that feeling that you are looking at a string of cliché to meet so often in the genre; Then you realize that the clichés have become clear only after they have been copied out of this movie in particular, and being so widely copied because this film was so great. In other words, it is a fundamental task. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a joy to watch. The big lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied many times in movies later, and nevertheless it still has a number of twists that surprise you. The dialogue, the rhythm and man's direction is excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan of this is a "must-see," but it's not alone in delivering a good performance. Considerably, many of the most thoughtful lines and / or minds go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cutout boxes, it lets additional realism in the movie. This is a remarkably underrated movie, and well worth keeping an eye out for. The DVD also has an interview with Stewart who gives some background on the movie.
