Early film short film was an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary details and lengths about the movie with its symbols, and its very pretty percentage. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to take a more tone-down approach to a long-forgotten movie that seems to have been shot on practically no budget and in casino-documentary mode. Pneumonia intercourse is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to arrest the primary insurance company (Palans). The film is medium, black and white injections, and makes good use of places. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbol (crimes of equal disease, and equal crime) and just enjoy the chase. It's not always easy to watch a movie like this now that we are well in this new century, as it is in a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII in the early 1950s) and will be easy for casual interest in watching movies. For those who will watch this for the first time, sit close to the big kick at the end. It's another thing, and honestly I do not know how to filmed some of it. I can say that he probably took the longest movie as he did the first 90 percent of the movie.
