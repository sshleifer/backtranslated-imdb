I always wonder what happened and what kind of magic to feel the old Slovenian movies seemed to have been in them ... Well, in time I was amazed if that feeling was just the nostalgia. Or does this "feel" decide to pack its bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never come back? Or did it? Because for me, it was the first time I saw "Express, Express". And it was old self again. <br /> There are three types of films that make it a bit unique and as enjoyable as it is look - the smooth flow of the story, the heat of the colors and, what I appreciate the most - lack of use Too much in verbal communication (something much of other screens (not fair) Slovenia should be at least considered). There is no use for words, when you can understand each other (yes, or better) by other means of use. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. So, in this very word, so I would recommend "Express, Express" to all of you, as a must-see Slovenian movie, whichever you can hear about Slovenian movie (if you've ever heard anything , this is ...) Oh, with this scene, where Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi's music ... A treat. Treat yourself. Look-l.
