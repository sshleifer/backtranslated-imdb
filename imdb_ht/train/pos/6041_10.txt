This is one to look a few times. The excellent writing shows that they lived this story or knew someone who did because he was nailed. Freebird made me revive and laugh at my youthful mischief. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, story, band and character. It's a booty movie but it should be a shame dove her way this way. Funny in the bone, as Trailer Park Boys in the U.K If you have never seen TPB, make a point if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other films. End? They could do. There's a lot more in the world I'd like to see in the eyes.
