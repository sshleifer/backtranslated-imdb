This is one of those movies that made me feel very much about the need for movies at all. Generally speaking, I'm a fan of movies based on deserving true stories. And this one is GREAT! In addition to Meryl's performance that has been greatly appreciated and praised, the best film is the story based on. Stained history of a couple suffering from social and legal torture, after being subjected to enormous emotional pain in the unexpected and brutal death of infants, is really an eye-opening fake that exposes the violent side of fellow humans, and uncovering barbarism in a highly refined and legal society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as good and intelligent people (emotional journals in the movie for example) are in fact nothing more than selfish self-esteem for pragmatic beliefs and prejudices, close the brains of Any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts show very clearly against their views. Other social figures called "civilized" that the film is exposed is apathy in the pain of human human fellow (unnecessary, this is very general, though this specific story unfolds in Australia), which goes as far as becoming a cruelty true. You must see if you want to take something serious and maybe thought-provoking.
