This is definitely one of the best jet's efforts. Some actors can play the stoic as Jet can. The action is quick-fire, and special-effects are boosted for intensity purposes. As a result, he can take a few guard-guard Americans. A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film. I feel it is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and look forward to more prince (especially the legendary point) to make it to the US market. A nice mix of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most fun flick entertainment.
