Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, smoothest animation and clever dialogue written in any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I especially like to work Don Novello's voice on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad the whole movie seems to move on the double pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney film is an antagonist who meets - which Atlantis does not give. It's the best average. Half of the film has a single twist. It's all. It's a big movie anyway. Everyone should check it out.
