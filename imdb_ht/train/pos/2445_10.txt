I really like this show. That's why I was ashamed to learn recently that George Lopez is a racist, and that he shot Masiela Lusha from the show, simply because he discovered that he was not a Latino immigrant but was emigrated from Albania. I learned this from people in the show. It was really one of the best part of the show, and so they learned that even among those who you think would be sensitive to racism, that they can also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, is really disappointing.
