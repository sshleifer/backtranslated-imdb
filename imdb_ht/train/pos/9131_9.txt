'I just want to see you laugh at the red rain.' This is an excellent movie. It should have been re-rated PG-13. But anyways, the first movie Prince and older. The tracking sigh. But I have not seen for years so here's what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has Jungle and win over the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), holding his group together (the Revolution as the Heads) and the tension of his family. But his band rival (the time as the head) will ruin his life. Like Morris (himself) trying to steal Apollonia from the Kid. Just like Fever Saturday Saturday, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you luv it, buy it.
