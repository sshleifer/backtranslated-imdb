Even though this may not necessarily have a so-called "classic" movie by today's standards, it's still worth seeing. The main reason why is because after having this movie, you get the feeling that you've also experienced the counter-cultural ideals of the 60's, no problem however good or bad. <br /> I've seen this movie in an English literature class at SUNY Geneseo, and even though at first it looks just a sense of composition of the 60 icons, the movie is far from being simply "thrown together" . If you let the movie feel satisfied and confused, the movie has done its job: it's targeting a deserted view of the future that leaves you feeling upset and upset. It was perhaps this same feeling that the movie sought to explore the youth he showed. <br /> <br /> As such, "Zabriskie Point" can not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, it also translates well to this sort of cliche, rebel desire to get out of the existence of which both Mark and Daria must share. Even the anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as gov't rebel against.
