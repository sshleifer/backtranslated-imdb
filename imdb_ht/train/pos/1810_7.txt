I can understand why some people love this movie, and why some people do not. For me, though, I really love it, though I notice some good bits, and are not so impressive. The animation was actually excellent, like Dream Charlie. The characters were a mixed bag, the better they were Anne-Marie, voiced late by Judy Barsi. (I was physically ill when I read what happened to him) Also, Carface is a very wicked contender, especially voiced by Vic Tayback in Wonderful (I particularly liked "My Morons are surrounded by Morons") and along with Rasputin and Warren T. Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth bands. Charlie and Itchy only just missed the same shine, but I liked King Gator and his song. Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's "You Never May Come Back", which kind of scary me always. Unfortunately, there were some bits I did not like very much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but the Disney pan was suffering from the same problem. Also there were some dark scenes, that small children would get troubled, but the finish is very intense. However the biggest flaws were the rather angry songs and how they sang songs. None of them in particular stick out, with the exception of "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love to Survive", and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has done the best song. All in all, a filmable, that might be more, but it is definitely memorable, and I would definitely look it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
