I watched this tape, immediately rewound it, watch it again and laugh twice as hard. I recommend this tape for those who are not lovers, but uncomfortable around transvestites. It shows you that transvestitism is a feature, rather than the whole one being. The comedy is not one problem. This man is brilliant. All the comics should love its level of prospects, intelligence and talent.
