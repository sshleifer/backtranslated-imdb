'Our song' gives you three teenage children, Maria and Joycelyn - best girlfriends hanging in late summer. Teen summer - even though we do not know the signals and landmarks in particular, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is / was the same for all of us. A lazy respite from the pressures and turmoil of the school. Welcome heat and value. And if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is somewhat different than most of us know - maybe as aliens a country like any. Young body surges new silhouettes ... new territory territory ... the maze for adults. The young spirit comes to himself, speaks for himself, saying this is my person, this is what I want to try to be. It is / has always been so. But this is how he plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s. Jim McKay is a movie writer / director of this film but recognizes everyone who has the suggestion to read. The title is open to slide `A movie does not seem to list all people in the universe. It's a gesture but at the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. [The titles also lock some of the most over-the-credit credits and appreciate I've read.] The sound recording sound by John McLaughlin deserves to be specially noted. McKay is a modest leader who knows who tells this story - it's his three Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are real things, the interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus in reality. This is no music video steno says in young life. It had the gravity of the time to sink. <br /> <br /> Hanging out with them, we do not quite feel included, but we feel privileged to listen to those real voices talking with the fullness of their crises and dullness in everyday life. We are witnessing modern mathematics in young life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed and resolved. Small scene illustrates great thoughts at all. Lanisha hangs with her father in his safety work - it's the only way she gets to spend time with her. We see the love that exists between them, but also their family and father failures. In a connected scene, Lanisha advocates her father to her mother, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and love her in return. And the three friends lie in their vision to share darkness and dreams - and we recall how crazy / funny kids and more tragic, how realistic hammer idealism these days. And in the end, Maria simply walks on the street is a short story of herself. We see it gather courage to keep all fear and doubt in butter. It demonstrates that we force one need to be able to embrace the vulnerability of affordable life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, turn and float away. It's terrible, but just in the way it is, is not it?
