Place in the World of Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who fell in love with a mystery woman with whom she made romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his store, which seems to be constantly tinkering with the colleague. Adding a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart - has an affair with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', with an admission that the sales girl 'liked 'Stewart all together, the happy ending is inevitable. Even though VERY Dated (references to poverty and I have a wife and two children are considered over-utilized, with the indication that many small objects of fun, such as a cigar cinema music, are out of reach for fun people in the common), this movie is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s are being re-done "You Received Mail". At the re-start of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of chain-of-events are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is grossly running. <br /> <br /> "Shop around the corner" is an innocent stroll down the memory line into a less complicated, less aggressive, and more romantic time and place known as the romantic utopia.
