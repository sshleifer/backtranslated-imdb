If "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and in German expressionist movies), this pre-WWI film is the grandfather. The student's title, starving in an empty gaw, makes a deal with the Devil - The devil gives him a deep bag of gold, in exchange for "anything in this room." The devil chose the reflection of the student in his glass. He cuts off with the student's doppelganger, who committed the crime in which the student was blaming. The movie is wrong by some limitations arising from the technically primitive state of 1913 film; The plot cries out for the effect of chiaroschuro, but the film is, in need, virtually all injection in daylight shadow. But the scene where the reflection is walking out of the mirror is still packing a box. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the tendencies it is to do than for its own sake, the student of Prague is still refreshing.
