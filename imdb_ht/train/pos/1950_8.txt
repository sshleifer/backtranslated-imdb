Diane Keaton has played a few "heavy" parts of her many years on the big screen but it's mostly known for the "light and fluffy" stuff with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it does not really matter what the contest was the year she first showed. Try and find a scene where it does not appear. And it was all heavy, tiring at its speed and retakes, action, all at full speed. The make-up made it as young as possible and it fit the 30s age category even in pre-ups, but played half his age and at a very fast pace. The movie, in general, was fairly well-made, performing with a good shot and a strong cast but Keaton brought the load.
