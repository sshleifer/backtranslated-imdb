Brutal, emotional Michael Myers broke his sister's death at age six-day Halloween in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he survived from a mental institution and instituted a new horror government in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is chasing the whole time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows just how bad this young man is. <br /> It opens with a bang, and sets up a really thrilling and atmospheric driver that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures he has been helping to inspire. It subtly compared to the embarrassing bloodbaths of these subsequent movies; subtle, and scary. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated look. How many movies have, really, that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them first? Not a lot. <br /> <br /> Pleasans are great at what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first photo movement, became a Queen Queen's queen after acting in "Halloween" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures, and she is a victim victim intended for rooting. -writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shade and black skies; Note how most of the film is set after falling. With this picture, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that spawned seven suites, many imitators, and an upcoming "re-imagined". It is very quotable - who can never forget Dr. Loomis "in which he describes Michael Myers in the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable player of several repertoire of Early Carpenter's work)? It's fantastic, and worth exploring out. This is my favorite movie John Carpenter at all times. <br /> It's not totally infallible - there's script hole, after all - but in general it's a solid impact.
