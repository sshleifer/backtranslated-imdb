Given the opposite circumstances in 2009 where the reality is we have a black president, this movie takes on quite a significant significant historical. For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and reputable. I was well taken back to course by the blatant racism at the time, but also found the music and incredible dance. Also it is quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr. as a very young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who was consoled by his Mammi. He said 'Why have some days you might be president'. This was so ridiculous in 1933 that he passed the mind and thought to be endearing, good and funny. Many of the film is a fantasy sequence in what the government would be like if it was run by a black man. They describe their place of government as being like a religious Baptist Church. <br /> <br /> The fact was when I stumbled on this movie one day and she drew me to. It is really well done and very fun. I believe we can look beyond the racism we can see this film for all of us. In fact realize that it is not only ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just make this movie much more important. It clearly marks a moment of time for our collective awareness.
