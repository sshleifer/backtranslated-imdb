This is one of the landmark films that need to be located in the context of time.Tarkness of Tallinn was made in 1993.It was a period of chaos disorder, confusion and gross disease not only for ordinary people in Estonia, but also for countless citizens of ancient nations who were part of the Soviet empire. It was in such a tense climate that a young country named Estonia was born.As newly established governments were encountered Dentistry issues, Estonia too did face many issues as some corrupt officials manipulated state-owned cars to fill their pocket pockets by making use of their selfish means. This is one of the movie's core theme. The Tallinn in Tallinn appears as a movie Estonian but was made by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried his best to instill as many possible doses of Estonian humor. This is why one can call him a comedy movie in underground politics. As ordinary people to participate in this movie, we can say that this movie want good against evil. is not a new concept as it is readily available to most of the religious books in different faiths. The Talinn darkness shows us how that ordinary government can also be reversed by corrupt people. Beautiful movies to look at a sunny day.
