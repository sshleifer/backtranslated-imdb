A comedy that worked amazingly was the little British effort "Divorce of Lady X (1938)". It marks the first couple of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before that little movie about uncontrollable fascination over the 19th century English. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well suited to screwball comedy, it all flows together nicely. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in Logan's hotel (hotel) priced hotel (Olivier) by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel. He does everything possible to irritate her - but in the crazy ways film goes, she falls for her. Then he fell for her. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (this all leaves Oliver in a note) is thought by Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse, and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his beloved wife Larry thinks to be Oberon! There are some nice fighting-of-the-sex dialogues, and fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedian, but in his true Olivier he is a professional consumer, and rescues. And he handles the twists and turns, perhaps not with ease but with love. Oberon had no great shakes as an actress, but he was usually competent enough, and despite the off-screen screens, he worked well with Olivier. This was filmed in early Technicolor which looks very primitive today (everyone looks even white than Michael Jackson), but maybe print needs to be cleaned.
