I think it's great example of the difference between the two cultures. It would be a great movie to show off a sociology class. I thought it was very funny and I must say that I'm a sucker so "let's band together and get the job done" tracing devices. It seems most people do not realize that this film is not just a comedy. It has a few dramatic elements in it as well and I think they mix nicely. In general, I give her a solid 8.
