A note note that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, it moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in film. More than a triple threat who can act, write and direct, he has a genius uniquely adapted film. One can consider whether at an earlier age it would be a painter. This film certainly boosts this impression. A musician, a theater actor, an heiress Shakespeare? hard to say but I'm very grateful for her time chat and movie and she was captured on film. I like the accent. I love the face, the size, the style, the idea and the toys. I love all of her movies and wants to have more. I particularly love how other actors interact with him on film. Many have never been better or at least somehow different from it because it was firmly established. Even at the end when her beauty was lost too, perhaps by her own intention, it was impossible to ignore and she made all the scenes she was in. Rita was a gorgeous blonde - a Lana Turner looks alike but maybe even lovelier and even when That's the eye going to Welles with one willingness for another minute, another film, another hour of her company. That is why we all hope that we could come over the scraps to lose off from his movie because we know, we all know, that no part of it does not deserve for us time. Watch it and be thankful for the chance.
