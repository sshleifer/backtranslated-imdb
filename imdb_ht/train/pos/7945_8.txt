I'm a fan of cinema animals. If you can take a plot and place animals like the main actors you will usually win me over. Playground did so only. They took a draw of old age as time and put a new turn on it. It was a complete success. It is a lot of archetypal films. You have Obi-Wan in the wise and logical group of shadows, you have the chance but eternal, but undoubtedly, with the prissy princess who thinks it should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounced off at each other very well. I also love how to make luck with Sassy these dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. Most people say it can not be good because it is too much of a movie child. What they're forgotten, however, is that it is supposed to be a movie of children, and this is still not taken away from the acoustic movie. This is a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without the drawings, a boiling bud film and a better draw. I would, without a doubt, advise you to look at it.
