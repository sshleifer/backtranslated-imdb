As a kid I thought this movie was great. She had animals, she had nice music, and she had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this film, for different reasons. It has well-trained animals that are set in various stages and scenes that look excellent on cameras. She has nice, well-written music that fits the scenes perfectly, and rousing fast-paced melody and heart wrenching the main theme, which always makes me cry. Even when hum hum. And she has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three pet houses, a smart, overly-trusted and remarkably paternal laboratory by the name of shadow, a witty and prosperous - but still smart - cat and a pair of water called Sassy and a street-smart curious curious and slightly necrophic bulldog, luck. Three were taken to a friend's farm when their family went away. Demonstrate and worry, the pets break out and plan a journey through the Sierra Mountains for the journey of life. A really incredible journey. So that, maybe home is just on the hill. But what if he does not? <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for those who love the three amazing actors giving their voices to the lead animal characters, and for anyone else ... yes, everyone goes looking at her.
