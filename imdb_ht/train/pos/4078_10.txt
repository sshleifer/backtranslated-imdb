This is one of all time I love movies, PERIOD. I can not think of another film that combines many types of beautiful films like this one make. This flicker has all the following: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best of all, you should not be in the Mensa "get it" and enjoy the movie as you do with some of the other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies take a break from thinking). This is just a flat-out movie enjoyable that everyone will love, so make yourself a favor and go buy it. The only note back is the American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it's rock! Who cares if you can not understand Japanese? If you can read to a second level then look at the original Japanese recording and English translation. You will not regret it.
