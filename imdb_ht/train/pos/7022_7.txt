FINALLY !!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting for this movie out for almost a year, and finally saw it in the premiere of SB. I met a few of the actors, who were really cute and who was great in the movie. I watched the trailer many times that I did not know what to expect but totally sucked in. The movie was really nice to look at it and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a ryan donowho fan, and dominic swain was good at it too. The other actors were also great. I hope it comes out on DVD soon !!!! <br /> I first got to Ryan from viewing the OC and then seeing him in a bunch of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. It's great in this movie, and everything he does this indie. I also love Dominique but did not see him at as much. Hope to see them both sooner !!!
