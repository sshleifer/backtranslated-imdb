Fortunately as a student I could watch "Diagnosis Murder" for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who resolves murder with the help of his LAPD child, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provides 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the show many other booths and worth watching many times on its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performance and roots to the craftsman Dick Van Dyke's brilliance and the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were the fast pace, witty scripts and of course scored the toe tapping. Unfortunately it was unjustly compared to "Murder, It Was Written". DM is far superior to twenty more difficult mysteries are resolved with more variety. Now it goes television is a worse place. Gone are the days of fragrant, family friendly friends show. Now there are just 'depressing' depressions.
