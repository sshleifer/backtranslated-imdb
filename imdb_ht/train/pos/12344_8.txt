The sea watch is made from an original script Akira Kurosawa, and it is indeed a lush and warm film. See that it will be a pleasure! <br /> Kei Kumai as director is certainly not equal to the old but eternal master (particularly the mass scene at the beginning of the film has some terrible act), but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable. Another thing missing here is Kurosawa still managing to let the characters be so much more then what they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> Probably that was his magic on wearing while shooting; and just maybe this script was not completely up again. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the eye of the master. <br /> <br /> This is one beautiful and sweet movie, but it is not Kurosawa. To expect that might be quite funny ...
