Terry Gilliam traveled again in the future (he had already made it to "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus in destroying the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite fun with Gilliam to prove that he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (all that happened to it) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, every time he plays the role that comes out of his hands and results for compulsion and it's not credible at all. It should just play good-looking young man. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 7/10
