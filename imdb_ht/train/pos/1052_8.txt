A remarkable documentary on the landmarks of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) in Kumba, southwestern Cameroon, to legally protect the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where people were always sovereign over women, according to the Law of Sharia, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing legal exclusions for women and children. After 17 years of failing efforts, WLA leaders have recently started to score a few wins, and this film goal is to share these victories. The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a former judge (President of the Court). Both playing themselves in this movie, which can have footage naturally, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreation at real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all the plaintiffs play themselves in the movie too. Two may involve battered wife, and gender strength in one case; another involves sex forced on a 10 year old girl; and yet another anxiety beaten repeatedly to a child, age 8, not an aunt. One of the wounded wives is also seeking a divorce. We follow the cases in the investigation into complaints of the results of the trials. The results of each case are favorable for women and children. The authors receive prison terms and / or fine; The divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive trial of the child beating a child demonstrates that the criminal justice authorities are true gender-neutral when it comes to strengthening the law. Also remarkable is the respect and to which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a very important and well-done movie. (In interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed 1998, Divorce, Iranian Style, has been dealing with terms related to Tehran.) (In English and English subtitles). My grade: B + 8/10
