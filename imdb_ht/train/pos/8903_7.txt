Be sure to drive a 50-in special, but do not let your fool. In my little book, there are a number of smart touches and unexpected sting of humor. Catch Madame Porter's redoubtable who should keep an eye on the doc's place. It not only steals the scene, but darts near the entire movie. And where those indie producers come with the movie bucks in color, a wise decision, since the blob does not show up well in b & w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as illustrated by the number of goofs. But except for several of the youth, the non-Hollywood cast does well. Then, too, the mid-range hot-rodders and cops come across as lively and entertaining. Pretty pretend good for a couple of more directors at home in a podium passing on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to show youth in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile offenders". Then again, 27-year-old McQueen's hardly qualified in the department of age, but manages the warm-rodder attitude anyway. The film was a hit at the time, helped together, no doubt, by the titling titled tune that got a lot of radio plays. And except for unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I look forward to returning to the patty now that the polar ice will turn into, we have to say, fridge.
