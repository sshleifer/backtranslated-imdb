This movie is really cool. Every thing looks like it comes from the comic book. The sets, the costumes, and the plot are great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite beat. He looked a bit better at the end of death, but he still pulled it off. Superman is great too. The flying effects are OK. but it's a fan-movie so we cant expect them to be the greatest. The shotgun and supermann grab the car was very credible. it was cool. This is a movie I would definitely see if it was real. It has got everything you want in a movie / superman movie. One exception though, I would throw the joker instead of 2-face ..... in general I give this movie a 10 because it's a great movie.
