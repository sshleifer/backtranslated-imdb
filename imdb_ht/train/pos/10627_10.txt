So what constitutes a real independent film? In one day and age where the latest whim of Hollywood mainstream is appearing resistant to cutting edge, I'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to see as independent films are virtually nothing more than a smart marketing scheme. <BR> <br /> Which is why we should be pleased that films such as "Hatred in One Minute" exist. Across the board, this movie makes a point out of its own pattern contradiction (independent movie film). Love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid of what it is, and in watching this movie, you get the real sense that Kallio (the director) did not just make this movie in spray Fake blood all over the place, it is in this storytelling. Good people. You can find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but do not be fooled, this story is also about love, good people pushing on the edge, and that oh-so-far light at end of tunnels . <br /> If you expect smut, or a evil evil elves, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the intricate points of the horror / suspense styles, check out this movie. Bruce Campbell has produced this film, and I'm sure she is proud to tell anyone that she's not "bad dead". Bruce never tried to gamble his "ash" image, and it's obvious that he did not participate in "wrong" so he could do that either. <br /> <br /> My advice, though, to all the Dead-Ites rabidly devouring anything from Mr. Campbell is to check this movie out and see what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you . The act is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (maybe intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performance in a horror movie. So often, actors in films like these do not seem to try, and "hate", it looks like if all the actors have taken thier charecters very seriously, never recouring the typical horror movie movie. /> Technically, "Hatred" is about as competent as independent movie gets. The fast correction, the good movie gives the budget, and "Hatred" keeps a quick pace, without any point-down or bad anti-climax points. <br /> <br /> All in all, hate does not have the glossed look at all of these multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally, I do not see a problem with that. It's a movie by how to actually care about the medium. People arriving at thier broken pocket ass, pulled out thiers nickles and dimes, dropping caution into the wind and made a damn bomb movie. <br /> Check out this one out.
