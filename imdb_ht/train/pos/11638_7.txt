I had fun looking red eyes. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well-directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven has given it a good speed. At least not another cry and killer in college usually. It's good when you can see a clean thrill, even if originality does not stand out as its main character. Particularly in a movie-maker like Craven who has brought many innovative ideas into the comic and horror genre of the past and that now just priests himself brings home what could be a good TV movie and has not been released teatrically. Good job!
