Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up I saw this movie many times that my dad bought another VHS copy because the old copy was torn out. My family received a VHS copy of this movie by purchasing a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure that this was a movie suitable for a 10 year old, but because we just bought a new VHS system and let me look at her. <br /> Like I said, this movie is every little little dream ?? The film has a terrific environment, great muscled barbarians, beautiful topless women, great bad monsters and jokes you will find only when you grow older. So, a couple of days ago I insert the video and watch the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, then began to think about how much I loved this movie when I was kid, and continued to watch. Yeah, the experience was not as great as I remembered ?? The act is very bad, the scenario is very bad, the jokes were not funny anymore, but the women were always nice. Yes, I grew up. Though the film experience changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the good times you know ??
