I like this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is a detail I would like to shed some light on: no footage of the real, still standing, Hôtel The North Coast (is it still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) used for the movie - the whole scene was rebuilt on the set, the main reason that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin Canal for several weeks.
