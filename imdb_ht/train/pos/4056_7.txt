See this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where he titled "Laputa: Castle in the Sky". I have allowed subtitles and I think SBS gives their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality. Just look up "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirm what I suspect ... is the floating island of this story taken from the Roman Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's Journey", which was published early in the 1700's. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a Japanese-made engage, which features a voice-cast angle. It is suitable for small children, I think, but it runs just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story of anxiety of children who seek to find a floating legendary island with a castle on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spying on the island too, and taking the kids (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help to find it ... the graphics are magnificent ... the photo-realistic sort of lenses, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days, and white clouds, or mist. <br /> <br /> Recommend.
