This is what I call a "close Sci Fi; Sci Fi" movie. It gets no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good picture "motion" picture. These two genuine artists are at their best, as are the story line. Karloff performs an amazing job as a scientist who sees himself in a sense of worthlessness, pride, and scientific competitiveness. I was in the mind watching someone as he drove himself to the three previously mentioned concepts. I was sad and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they did themselves in. This is the picture of the movement that begs for a rumor. This time put Harrison Ford off Karloff and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as the Bela Lagosi role. It might be possible to make it almost as good. This is one of the best that Hollywood ever produces. As I said .. it gets no better. There is no way.
