I do not agree with anyone who does such a movie. <br /> I used this movie LOVE when I was little and still doing. It's sweet, funny and warm your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> But even if it did not have much of a story, it was still excellent I gave it a 10 and two thumb. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and it proves that the deepest you want and dream can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> I love this movie, personally if someone says it sucks out I'll say "shame on you." Because it was a delightful movie and I am glad that at least some loved it.
