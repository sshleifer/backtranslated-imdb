If you walk in this minute even late, you will be in for a shock, the movie will have already begun. You do not want to miss the first few jokes, in view of you came missing any jokes. Wow! I never saw a movie that ended with such a final finish. Not to be tough, I mean I liked it, but it just surprised me that it really keeps going until it stops! But I'm getting ahead of myself, allowing start with the very beginning of it, when it started. The plot scheme goes like this, there is this man, and does not give away any degradation, (* Spoiler Alert !!) (it has not had any gender ever (!) Used this device to the plots putting stories and moving, and having (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations have been in the main characters, some with irony, jokes, and awkward situations you know. <br /> The principal uses the technology advancement by combining the film shot on the series and dialogue dialogue, some music, and jokes making a comic movie, designed as a comedy, where he takes us on a trip out of the credits opened in the end with a totally full movie in between I went to this movie hoping to see a comic comedy because of what I had already known about it and left feeling as if I had just left a theater that just played a comedy funny.
