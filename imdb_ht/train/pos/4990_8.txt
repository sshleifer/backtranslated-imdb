As other evaluators noted, this is an unjustly overlooked Depression-era film. Realized by Frank Borzage (of the Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave It In Heaven, The Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), it is a tough, well-structured and unmanaged move on denigrates to New York City Shantytown. They are grifters, beggars, and women are forced into prostitution, but they are a community of both good and bad, and loyalty as complex as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main among this movie is admirable kind of is the contrast between characters Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Trina Young's Trina. It's hard-talking, physically aggressive, and fearless evidence - but Bill is not the character that gives this film its sense of survival. While it's bluster, Trina actually hangs hard (if this term can be applied to a ladylike character). Her devotion to it is obvious and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says she will lift her head if she wants to leave, or "I'll even give up the kid if you'll just be happy." This is the dignity of performance Loretta Young (at age 20) as a simple character, that it seems neither weak nor dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it, and wants nothing more.
