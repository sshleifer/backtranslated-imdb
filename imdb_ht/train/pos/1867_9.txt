This is a movie about life, the triumph of adversity and wonder in the human spirit. I challenge anyone who does not shed a water at the end of the movie. This is more than just a tearful jerk, it's an engaging, thought-provoking drama with excellent performance throughout the cast, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years ago, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual gender and Washton only leads another movie. However, apart from a slow build-up, the story of testing these children and tribulation and how it still affects it in adulthood is the movie sort that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many fox fox fox, this was more of a Sleeper hit and did not get the mass of reputation she deserved. Scenes in places where Appointed finally satisfied her mother summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that she could have done and she could all schmaltzy or she might have been unrealistic but Washington hit exactly the right tone, her mother 'Never say a word and can only shed a water, while antowning also wonder why. An overwhelming guilty man does not say anything, what can he say to defend himself? One of the most moving cinemas scenes I've seen.
