I feel very sorry for people who go to cinema with a pad and pencil writing flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is. I also feel sorry for those who go to the movies and NOT stop arresting and / or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes away from their boring or busy lives! Find someone GRIP. ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take the movie seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to look like the book in any way, this is not for you. But if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of Priscilla queen in the desert, or "what the hell I watch" at Moulin Rouge. Or the gross out comedy of "this sweetest thing" then let yourself escape to cowgirls. It has some really funny parts. Hilarious actually. It also has some really good music; kudos kd.lang. Also I mentioned it is 90 minutes at Uma Thurman ..... need I say more?
