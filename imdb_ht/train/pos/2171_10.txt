A real classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, the scenario is a haunting succession of suspense scenes. The car scene and scenes of the hills are breathtaking. Ask if this movie is already from DVD, because it must be viewed in widescreen version. This film was seen in fifty late soldiers, perhaps three or four times, and never since then forgot it. I remember it was one of Warner's first feature cameras to cope, the Warnerscope process was given a beautiful movie. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserve an Oscar for their performance. The only thing I could criticize is not ruled by someone like, says Nicholas Ray, raising its rhythm and tension.
