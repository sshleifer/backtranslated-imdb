I've never been a big fan of TV until I watched 24 for the first time. I got in the very late series. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 on my DVR (digital video archive) box while I was sitting for the weekend. It was taken that one episode for me to be Hook and Sinker line in the world of Jack Bauer. And my boy was hooked! I watch the next six episodes without shining an eye. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty dollars something and useless to say it was the biggest blockbuster I ever had. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty minute episodes !!! I'll say that finding out what's happening next is much easier on DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine participating in waiting the Season 6 Week Week !! I find it struggling torturous and cruel, but I'll give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I will chomping in the bit !!
