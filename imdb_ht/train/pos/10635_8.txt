I appreciate the photography, textures, colors, and often, unlike one comment, the lighting. What was missing for me was a coherent storyline. I found it often disjointed, seriously edited and at times hard to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDB showed only 125m. Maybe off and the translation did not help. I applaud any movie that escapes from the Hollywood mold but this let me be disappointed. Miss Gillain was glowing and the performance was all fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone wants to see another movie with some of this affinity, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
