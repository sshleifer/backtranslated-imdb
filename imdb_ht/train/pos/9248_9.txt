Keeping Your Man Get Jean Harlow, working class girls from Brooklyn falls for Clark Gable's people and getting into all kinds of issues. The movie starts out like her movie, but by the time it's on the emphasis definitely changed in her character. The film opens with Gable pulling a street game with partners, Garry Owen and the shout crying for the cops. As she was being chased Gable Duck at Harlow's apartment and she was like a good fellow and protected her. Before long he participated with him, and unfortunately his racketeers. Gable, Harlow, and Owen try to pull a badger game on a drunken Paul Hurst, but then Gable will not go through with it. Of course when Hurst realized it was a hassle, he was still wrong and came up with Gable to punch him out. But then she winds up dying outside Harlow's apartment and that blond hair platinum makes it easy to identify. It's up on a killing accomplice. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is it and its adjustment to prison life. His interaction with other female prisoners gives him some very good scenes. I think some of the material were later used for the Caged Classic MGM. <br /> <br /> Harlow also gets singing in titles and it does like castle style tango, very popular back in those days. She speaks / sings it in Sophie Tucker's style and well. Gable is well driven as the man who develops a consciousness, a party he often plays, most notably in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. <br /> Always read in Harlow that gets bright in this movie. I think it's one of the best it's been doing at MGM, his fans should not miss it.
