If you've seen Dogtown and Z-boy or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, "real American" side of America then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you've ever seen before. This movie is "real", an easy term if ever there was one, but largely inappropriate if you can derive any literal form from it - it is a documentary documentary 100% , but with all the drama of a opera, with the essence of love, expert and knowledge instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swollen huge wave while keeping you completely enthralled in all your stuff has given the privileged view. This film is a symphony, manufactured as well as Beethovens 9th, starring very well with its preliminaries in Hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotions in Santa Cruz and finishing with riot, triumph and crescendo at Laird Hamilton Fairies, again in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classic music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries or Barber Adagio for Ropes, this can be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Believe me.
