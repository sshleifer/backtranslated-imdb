I personally thought the movie was very good, very good acting by Tadinobu Asano in Ichi's bloodthirsty remake. I really can not say much about the story, but part had confused me a little too much, and in general I thought the movie was just too long. Other than that, however, the superb film acts great fight with a lot of places of great shot, great effect, and a lot of swords. Another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well I really can not say again about the movie, but if you're just outlook on Asian movies is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying dolg, I would suggest you are trying to rent it, but if you're a hard-natured Asian fan Movies I would say this has to be in your collection of very good Japanese movie.
