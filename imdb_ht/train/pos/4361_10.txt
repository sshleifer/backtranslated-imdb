This was probably one of the best films in the 40 - Warner Bros. at the very height of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably its finest success - gorgeous composition with lighting and delicate shadow. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful notes - the epitome of his classic motif method. The music adds great emotions and excitement to the plot and it is exquisite and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team made this movie go right on making "Voyager Now" later this year - a fine film that won honors and awards and came down as a favorite historic, ciefly because it plays Bette Davis. In my opinion, the "Gay Sisters" is a better movie - best made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film that entertains people who take it for what it is, rather than their own creative modern creative sensitivity or advanced standards and requires hyper-critical perfection. Each item has to be judged by its own reference and for what it tries to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are for kids and totally miss the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filament mignon, do not go to the baking counter and start to shine and complain about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is really lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry - maybe if this film had a score in the Rolling Stones and one hundred complex crazy and soul looking, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions a day of the week!
