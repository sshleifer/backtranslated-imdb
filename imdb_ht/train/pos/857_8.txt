Greet again from the darkness. Many anticipated, tight comedy from writer / director Richard Shepard is an upcoming party to the Pierce Brosnan actor. That guy goes off. This new guy is something else !! Was it that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the boy for the role of this plum, but Brosnan proves Julian Noble's perfect, "Facilitator" ... and it is anything but beautiful! Do not underestimate how twisting the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and gags on all kinds of gender, death, religion, sports, business and anything else that you might be politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script at another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a happy to see. Greg Kinnear is the right guy in the Brosnan's comic and has a lot of depth and humorous distribution to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small but subtile effective role to support as Kinnear wife (what's his name "Bean"?) Which happens to be a little excited when he has a facilitator in his living room. visuals and settings are perfect - including a ticket, cushion and suburban Denver. And how often do we get the Killers with Xavier Cugat on the same track? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit of center and you enjoy film-making risks, it might be for you.
