Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful heat that reaches a road bar. She met the young, beautiful and unsuspecting wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), master of the bar. It translates its mechanical skills by some food and housing, and has a deal with Giovanna. They both decided to kill Giuseppe, too, as a car crash. The relationship of them becomes affected by the guilty guilt and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realism films of Luchino Visconti are outstanding. This is the first time that I watched this version of "The Still Life of Two Folders." I liked the version of 1946 and Lana Turner, with the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the most sexiest scenes Hot in the story of the movie, but this one is certainly the best. My vote ten.
