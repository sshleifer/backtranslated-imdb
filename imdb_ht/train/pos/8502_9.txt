Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton has put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his city so creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens next is a hilarious moment after another. Two cultures are clashing and it's up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly cast. Do not be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to remember that the city's name in Hadleyville was also used in High Mid. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
