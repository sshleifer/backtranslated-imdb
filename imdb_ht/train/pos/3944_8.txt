This little movie has long been on my "guard" list. Do people realize how to insist, menopausal, women's abused emotions (as well as mentally late) were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ?? All monastic monastic attitudes at that time were very dangerous to explore emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because she acknowledged women as she had emotional and emotional responses as great as a man? Think about it! The sensitivity to this movie always gets me and I give credit to the director for capturing this in his eyes.
