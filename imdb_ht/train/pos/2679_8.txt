Delirious, near draw-less attitudes pieces and whether it's more LSD inspired than the devil then we must remember when he did! After a new SM opening (which itself itself is not similar) we move through soft focus and dreams or imagination or remember ??. Many of the literary and cinematic references are all that is the Franco movie that the tongue itself praises. The beautiful and fascinating film unfolds in a leisurely rhythm but has a wealth of every fold. A rare film of the sore. Old Jess could do 'em when he tried. Fine core performance too including Jack Taylor's unmatched and Howard Vernon. I do not even mention the Lisbon lists - ah!
