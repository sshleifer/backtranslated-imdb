I would just say, that no matter how budget low the movie is, it needs to be shown throughout the world this point of the movie. We do not read so much, instead of watching movies. Having this series come out on DVD, I made it want to read the entire set and you want more. PLEASE Make 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the characters either, and break the effect. Because I grew up to love the actors who played their characters. PLEASE Make 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message, and watch the message that these books and now the movies here are shown. We have not found enough. AWESOME JOB !!!
