I missed the entire season at the show and started watching it on ABC's website in Summer 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think the entire cast is excellent. It's one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program program for this fall and did not see it on the schedule. That's really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they wait until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it only my wishful thinking? <br /> I read some of the comments posted on the show and see many glowing remarks, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or expect that another station will pick it up.
