Ronald Coleman's beautiful urban is show-cased here as in some of its films. It is literally in every scene and this funny movie remains cool because of him, not in spite of him. She is beautiful, witty and very clever here as she remains a step ahead of her lost wife, virtuoso - playing perfectly by Anna Lee. The movie is based on a French game and brings all the best qualities of this stuffing. Most of the support cast is well known, at least not facing if not ... and are absolutely perfect for this movie is very funny. The knowledge of Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he remains a step ahead of the other characters. His multi-talented talent can be further appreciated in the classic "Horizon Lost" that every movie scrub must see.
