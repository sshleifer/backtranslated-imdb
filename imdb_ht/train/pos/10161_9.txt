I took a flyer to rent this movie but I had to say, it was very, very good. On all the foreheads: script, cast, director, photography, and high production value, etc. Eva Longoria Parker proves to be top and shoulder in rome / com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who bug and call it act. Who knows what? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to keep out for projects as good as "on their dead bodies." Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I saw it. And finally, Paul Rudd gets shining in a really good film, instead of smaller films. A movie like this never gets its dues from pre-minded men. It's too bad. As other IMDb evaluators here noted, there is nothing lame on this gem - to write hack or act. <br /> <br /> With its illustrations of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, make each scene look bright, beautiful, neat, and otherwise exceptional in every way. Never before had a movie made L.A look good. Ah, what a tiny talent and a lot of caring for a movie. <br /> I will not disclose the plot, but as a long and hard atheist core, I wanted to stop disbelief and purchase in the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment. He reminds me of the many "Topper" movies, which are also so enjoyable. <br /> This movie exposes folk, but otherwise renowned, movies like "Ghost" for the crisis of mediocre and overwhelming anger. We already know the public tastes lean toward the mediocre. Some of us save us for the truly worthy, however. If you have been enjoying other giants such as "The Night" and Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" and Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dream" and JoBeth Williams, "The Chances" and Robert Downey Jr. , Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Make Mr. Right" and John Malkovich, etc., you will enjoy this. <br /> A first-rate job all around (though it's hard to believe a straight guy can claim to be gay for more than five years.) But even this tracing device does not detract from the movie excellence general.
