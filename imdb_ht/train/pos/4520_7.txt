A bit too long and goes on top of the end, this comedy is a very delightful, never condescending or ridiculous look at the issues of a "power man", which likes to wear women's clothing. Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is completely credible and steals the movie. She (he) is absolutely gorgeous in the high heels and costumes either.
