"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, not just a comedy, but also an animate action. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager who is also an expert in martial arts Ranma engaged Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained for many years .. Akane is the least The most violent sister in Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and love to win money no matter what. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma gets a girl when they are projected with cold water as well as her father 'Become a panda, many new characters and situations begin to happen. They also discover the reasons for the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell into a curse. But not only did they have this kind of fate ... br> <br /> If you watch 'Ranma 1/2' 'and love, I would recommend you' 'Inuyasha' 'and' 'Maison Ikkoku " , other good creations from the Rumimo.
