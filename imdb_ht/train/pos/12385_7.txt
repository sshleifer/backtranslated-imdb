Man, I really like the new DVD that Universal puts out. I've never seen the sentinel watch this good since I had to wear and crappy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately there is no expense that exceeds a trailer that looks very much worse than wearing. And AVOID the DVD Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It is absolute. <br /> In any way, Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) fashionable fashion model is moving to haul brownstone NYC, only it's more than just haunting. It is also a portal in hell with the Vatican holding an old blind priest (John Carradine) keeping watch over it and ensuring that the spirits and arch-angels do not escape. This star has all full cast of old-time actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer etc ... as well as the upcoming camera 80s including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (in Voice was mysterious overdub) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach in LAW & ORDER. I did a double-take when I was not quite where I would see her before. <br /> <br /> Nice Gore scene at Alison slicing the eye and nose of his father's dead body that was owned by the devil. And there is an end to finish defining, deforming people trying to haunt Alison in suicide suing so he will not be the next one to the gatekeeper. It looks like the troubled Alison makes it a prime candidate by the Vatican to become the next Sentinel. <br /> An excellent, climbing 70s classic from director Michael winner who should not miss. I also recommend it to those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual teenagers teenagers and thunder comedy. <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> -
