After reviewing this intense martial film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say he does not lose any of his mysteries, nor any of his ebb-eraser actions as I have been remembered since my youth. The story of a dead martial arts instructor sent "ending" his students out to find the past 5 members of his Poison Clan, so they do not seek a fortune that the master's friend kept hidden. Fearing that his recent students did not have enough training, he instructed his friends to treat one of the five "veins" so as to defeat the other cards. <br /> I can not say enough about the choreography or camera work. A fine film of its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts films ever made. A classic!
