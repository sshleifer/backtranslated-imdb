Commenting on the person who said that Robertson is wrong and his program is wrong nothing to compare wrong and upright. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people are calling good evil and evil good! He does not even know that he has fulfilled the prophecy of the Bible! If you do not know God and refuse to know him right now, this is okay. He always loves you, but when you finally bend to your knees, and you will, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone in hell, not you! You will go to your own decision and spewing your defining it! May God be gracious to you and give you a Damascus Road experience. The 700 Club and the Robertson Pat Ministry is one of the reasons I'm still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God came to the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God he did! You may say you have said but you can not cursing your words. God has mercy on you.
