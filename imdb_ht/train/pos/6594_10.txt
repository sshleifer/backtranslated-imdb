Types-tip teachers thought they had made it all calculated. Today's Polynesia settles down from Migrainian asians, exciting moving from the Far East, the islands island, east of Tahiti and all the other tropical exotic islands in the South Pacific over thousands of years. But the thought of establishing just did not sit well with young Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation was true, how many people born and raised in these islands have tradition, artwork, and physical characteristics similar to people from Asia, but South America? How does the vegetation in Ecuador, Peru and Chile look much like what you would find on the island many miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the Islanders show from the South American oceans and say that is where their ancestors come, led by Turkey, the equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how is it Norway talking in pre-scandalous Scandanavian who has been chasing from the South American continent being colonized and, along with some of the native people befriended, placed on the WEST WEST SEAS? It's all too much to be a Heyerdahl coincidence. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of equipment, and the local know-how for traditional raft-building, an expedition begins. It's as much a journey through the human imagination as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that is such a travel possible with only the many basics of tools and riders. Oscar-winning documentaries can be dating in its tone and Anglo-Ethnic approach, but it grows with a spirit of adventure even better in the space program launched a decade later, as the boys want to risk it all testing a theory they think it's true. Wonderful thing. Make yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing page-Turner with the perfect setup for the Newsreel-style movie.
