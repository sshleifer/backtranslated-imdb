In the year 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg led a emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a African-American girl Celie (first role for Whoopi Goldberg) whose life was followed in rough times. The story begins from 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. He gave his two sons to his father. Celie has a younger Nettie sister and who she is inseparable. A widow puts eyes on Nettie, but Dad gives him Celie. It is the beginning of an era of terrible and constant abuse. Women are inferior to men and especially an African-American women's rights are less than a zero. Celia's story is a true survival story. The <br /> <br /> The "Purple" is a master-piece film and underestimated in Spielberg. It should be more drama that the "Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good notions. <br /> The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is known best as a comedy ravingly comic but the role of introducing as Celie is a remarkable word that he really can pull into heavy dramas. Danny Glover was amazingly embarrassing "Mister". I never saw him in such an evil role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia. <br /> Warning! Prepare to have a lot of tissue with you when you watch this movie. You can really connect to the story of the solid sister. Especially if you have close relationships with your sibling as I have with my sister. Big Big Thank You to Mr. Spielberg!
