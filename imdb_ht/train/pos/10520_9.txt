I saw this movie that an Austen Jane was addicted to and still felt skeptical about cinematographic makeover of the complexity of her novel: well, this transposition is simply accurate, smart, delicate, careful, tactical, respectable, intense, in a word , do not do! br> <br /> "Emma" is one of the most delightful and funny Austen novels, thanks to irony in general corrupted situations and characters. The film respects this subtle irony, does not overlook the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What engages me in the novel, and the movie makes it clear, is the deep knowledge of human life shown in the English novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relationship are busy, and it is surprising if we think how a Roman novel of the 18th century, which lived almost a lonely life, could have reached the depth and truth of life as it did: most and always fascinating to me. We can feel this modern all over the movie: just replace costumes, and use a more current language but situations, their feelings, ideas should be very modern. I think of morbid interest in the lives of others, or envy of envy that now as always women's relationships, and is still difficult to reveal, and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love: all situations become a universal and out-of-time value. <br /> Throw is really talent and offer very good and very brilliant performance: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays it would probably be too mature for her), Toni Colette is simply great. And how I had invented them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! Then the grandiose English country, where each situation becomes like a magic and dream-like dimension ... a movie really enjoyable and worthy.
