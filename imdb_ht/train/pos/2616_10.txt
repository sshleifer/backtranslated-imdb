The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to go along with the king's lion. It basically follows the original story of the Lion King but with a couple of twists. In the movie, explanations are explained by a different character from point of view. This story is still an original plot. As far as end goes, Disney is not all that great in making people refreshing. This one, the third part of the Lion King (Pride Simba is the second.) Actually has an original idea while still involving the first fun. Timon and Pumbaa travel together looking for the ideal places to live. After searching far and wide, they find place in "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a small lion called Simba, and go to many things that parents today go through. <br /> I think this is a very good movie, and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
