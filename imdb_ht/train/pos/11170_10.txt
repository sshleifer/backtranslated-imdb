There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere else. Maybe the fact I was a kid when I first looked she had experienced this memorable. But as I keep watching it over and over again, it never gets old, and I never get bored. From the opening credits and the opening song to climb the extremely chaotic finish, there's something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> I do not think it would be helpful to relate the entire story again. All you need to know is to start from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step into B (which is, believe me, the end of the whole happiest). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I should be. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
