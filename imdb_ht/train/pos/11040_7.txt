Watch this french french movie last night and very much liked it. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell and basically three prisoners who get a handwritten newspaper in a wall from a serial killer that has escaped prison in 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look at the diary, they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might make their way out of the cell and to freedom. What to find out is something completely different, and terrible to say at least. I love high-budgetary film film, which delivers the merchandise of a quality quality, and tells a good story. This movie does so only, despite taking a while to go. The result with the horror to unleash is very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the ride. Not a lot of gorts, but that would not fit the story, although the gor has it is very good.
