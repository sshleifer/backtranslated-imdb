Eight Simple rules started as a very fun series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and his relationship with his children were the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry Bridget, Bridget who did before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to it in many ways, although I'm not sure I love the direction of her character going in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were fun, simple young genes on Paul and Cate's discipline children, however I think the show loses in brightness when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wanting to continue the series, but when she died, I felt the program was done. For me the whole point of the show was based on the guide of the '8 simple rules of dating to my child's daughter' was written by a real man and young daughter and the importance and angle of the show changed unchanged without the Father Hennessey Bridget seemed to get more annoying, Rory remained the same as Cate had always provided her child's life lessons that seemed to be funnier when he left Paul. I think the Granddad is funny (especially when he watched Great Escape), but feels CJ is unnecessary at the show. It's funny at party but I felt their story line at the time of his arrival was very similar to the American comedy series. Overall, what is most new is not a mere excitement, and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate works at school with C.J and Granddad still? I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for Paul and Kerry, but later on was the best average.
