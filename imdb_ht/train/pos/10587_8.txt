This movie does not slip, despite the production of Lfi's and its links to Troma's production. A dark fetish for adults. Exploitation is a theme of Sugar Cookies, and one wonderful thing if the cast has not fallen off the said terms. An unusual and visual catchy film: shadow and contrast are important. Definitely worth a look, especially in fans of Warhol and stylish decadence. Through all cruelty and cruelty, a moral, albeit twisted, can shine.
