This film documented the Harlem Ball Circle in the mid-80s. Many fun than Palazzo Volpi, though sick, this movie is a true gem of scrupulous. One can not help but sympathize with the characters because of the freakness. The purpose of the middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of the garbage and the glitz. Here is the most genuine genius of very well documented and hardly glamorous. The characters' characters for the use of images of all that is glamorous inspire even more adoration of the characters themselves on the part of the viewer, creating a "phenomenon of a phenomenon" effect that makes this movie a piece of art.
