In all truth, it really is not a "movie" so much as an extensive final episode; Not that I mean, you did not follow the TV series (Homicide: Life on the street) I suspect that you would have a hard time following this make-for-TV movie. After saying that, "Omizid: The Movie" is always a great look. I think he says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return, much after years of absence, once again shows the characters and closes in an incredible program. The film brings out this sense of "family", not only among the characters, but amongst the actors, as well. It's all very bitter-sweet to know that this will be the LAST time we'll see them all together again under the title of Homicide. Wise history, I found this movie a bit lacking. The judicial candidate of the mayor seemed to be particularly compromised, and I felt his shot had been faced with the parameters of his regular position, as Leiutenant. Also, Det. The extreme Bayliss's extreme hung hanging at the end of the series, is finally resolved, but I, for one, NEVER feel it needs to be; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let's note that the first episode of the first episode too goes to kill for the whole series running!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this film, and the fact that he did after H: many were canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who had not had the slightest exposure to the series. Now if they would just drop it on DVD ...
