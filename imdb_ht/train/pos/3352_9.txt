should have a sub-genre in the West called the 'Robert Mitchum West'. The brilliant Mitchum, which is idiosyncratic, is usually undervalued by Westerns to portray his own noir character to some of the black character's characters, and brings an elusive world-tremendous more familiar to the films of Sam Peckinpah. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Achieved by Orson Welles to Protect Richard Wilson, it's a great, monochromatic beauty, full of silhouette chalets and great turmoil in wild violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a city that was terrorized by a monopoly and a private army. Mitchum's reverence comes from soft speakers who talk to the late murderer, and a host of black emotions in between, is a gay expression, physical act.
