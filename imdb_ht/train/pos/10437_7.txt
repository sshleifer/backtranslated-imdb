This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspension. There is no abrupt surprise. If you can not stand to see a movie about two people who just talk and walk, about a story that slowly develops until the very end and romance love-dovey, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're in dialogue, mastery story says, thought provoking ideas and finding real love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's really fantastic. I really mean that. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying and styling at times but fortunately, the chemistry between the two acts is very natural, warm and sensitive. They act and feel each other from the very beginning, which makes you feel like a hackers. In conversations, there are excellent comments on many topics that will induce thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for these young characters but I could underestimating their intelligence. Still he did not break the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple which I think the film it's charm and finally it's power. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The film's flow is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. The story builds slowly, systematically and solidly. Constructed up to the final is satisfied with the rewarding end.
