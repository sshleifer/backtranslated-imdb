Sandwich between San Francisco and Captain courage of Spencer Tracy's greatest party is this very curious movie about war and its effects on some people. They gave him a Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone Stars in the movie that they had never joined together with Gladys George as the woman who loved them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tuna are a couple of World Draftes, Tone is a weak character that almost goes to the hill at Boot Camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing the lovable blowarm, the youngest Wallace Beery type that MGM envisioned for her when she signed up to Fox. <br /> <br /> Over the tone in front of an opportunity and take it when during a fight she managed to get to a church tower that peered down on a German car nest weapon. She learned to shoot now and did a York sergeant. But Alvin C. York has never been changed by the Tone's war. <br /> <br /> Injury in the Battle Tone Combat in a hospital with George Gladys looking out for him. Tracy goes AWOL himself to his pal, and George finds something to go. Later on when Tracy is reporting missing in action, Tone and George married. Tracy's brihearted when she returns and learns at the wedding, but sits in stride. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film deal with Tune applies their skills during the war she learned from Gangster trading. It's a hit-man now and George does not really know what he does for a living. I think you can calculate the rest out. The part of the film that gave me some problems is that I can not believe Gladys George could not figure it out. She is a smart little girl, her part is as much as she played in the Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney. Speaking of the Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development looks like the Tone although it was not the central character of the movie. In fact, the element has been given a weapon that must be found in taxi drivers and in the classic Clint Eastwood, the Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The war World Battle sequences are very well performed by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason Leonard Maltin has panned this movie, I think it's better than giving it credit.
