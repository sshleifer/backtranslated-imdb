There was not a day in 2002 where I was not chased by a scarecrow I felt that this movie occupied a serious problem well <br /> It brought back a lot of memory as it was so real <br /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares about the cob's corn, and can not even go near things stuck in pairs of my life <br /> I have to admit though, at one point in the movie I had to turn it around as it hit too close home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, do not watch this movie you could educate about how he felt for us This victim teaches us not to take life for granted or disruption with corn, believe me, I was there and I have the marks <br /> Watch the movie, amazing and her education
