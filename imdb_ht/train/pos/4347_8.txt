I will not go into too much detail on the plot of this movie as other reviews have covered pretty much the same earth. <br /> <br /> Just meant that I really enjoyed the movie very much. Peter Falk's performance is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> A small movie 'Road Trip' with Falk & Paul Reiser in Northern NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. Many facts based on humor and some well played drama give the movie a feeling that it might be your own family. <br /> <br /> Really can not say enough about this movie except that it's a humorous shame that a beautiful movie like this does not get more exposure while other junk out there has to do. <br /> It's great to see Falk and a leading role man again & he does most of it. He proved his famous friend & writer / director John Casavettes to be good at Falk's casting in his film debuted in the 60s & 70s.
