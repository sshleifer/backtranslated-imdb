Bruce Almighty is Bruce Nolan's story, an average man who feels God is pity up his life. God encountered him and showed Bruce errors in his way. Of course, giving someone the power God could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is the first-rate and looks good at home as God and the cast brings the plot along well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort to a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I loved the fact that the film actually describes God, not only that, but also as a black man. I thought that well, especially with Freeman's brilliant. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening candle scenes for example, others miss the target a little but still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
