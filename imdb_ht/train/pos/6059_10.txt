This is an excellent documentary, packed with beautiful racing action action and a great story. IMAX Camera gives you a very wide perspective, such as a DVD movie it is perfect. You hear every speaker working almost all the time, the movie does not speed up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. Of course, some sound effects are added but I think they are good, they give a deep stage to drive.
