I saw this first movie in a theater in France a year or so ago. He came and went with little fanfare, but I loved it for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating fascinating tree. (The story, while beautiful, is really incidental. If you actually think about it, there is no way most of what happens to happen in real life.) I just saw it again tonight, here in the United States, on DVD. Again, I pick up having very limited distribution. Blockbusters only had one copy of it, and I do not remember it ever playing in the art houses in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> See on my TV, photography is not as breathtaking, though it's still pretty much. The wildlife is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between children of 10 years old and the fox is even less convinced the second time around, when you know where it's headed. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a nice movie to look, and if you like trees, you should get this fascinating.
