I really enjoy watching this movie on the Delany sisters. I knew of them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes in their bravado and courage. What a fear. What sacrifices are made to live life on their own terms. This is not just a movie for Black Americans, but for all Americans. It is sort of a story lesson and a documentary rolling in one and combining with a fun movie biography. The superior act was not all included and we really get a glimpse of the two sophistication difficulties that have gone on for many years. Both sisters are quite different to each other. They came from a very loving and strict family and high, perhaps even impossible to standard of perfection. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to allow her daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding. I strongly recommend this movie and I am glad I keep it on the TV the other day.
