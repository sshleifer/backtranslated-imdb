This movie is wonderful. <br /> I was 'enchanted', I should say, and wonder because of the uniqueness of her way. The cast, the sequence, the effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it outstanding to the rest was that he said in a fun, quality way. <br /> For me, it is the representation of modern fairy tale. It's like the modern peter pan ... simply amazing <br /> I would probably buy a copy this moment it hit the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double to see one ... !!!! 10 stars for this!
