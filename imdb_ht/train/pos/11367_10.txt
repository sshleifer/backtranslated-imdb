Caution: Maybe crowds ... <br /> I saw this movie 3 times & I loved it every time. When they see it again, I always remember how good it is. A HBO-TV movie very well done as most of the movies - this Oscars has gotten for his performance and has been released for general distribution instead of being made for television. <br /> As I'm sure I know anyone in reading other reviews here, this is the story of bandit series, Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried, he could not find he was only sentenced to 52 out of 53 to kill him.) The story actually focused more on the legal analyst, Victor Burakov played in perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who gets tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the extra obstacles that were placed by hacking party, his party is essential to be sure. There is a very touched scene towards the end of the movie which mentions how America, investigators regularly removing serial killer series after 18 months if they want or not due to mental strain & frustration. According to this acct, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break from him. He followed the case at its conclusion, 3 years later. At this stage, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him he admired his dedication, and apologized for not knowing he should have given him an earlier break. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! He is a passionate person, but does not show it in the same way as is usually described in detective movies. It only occasionally provides crisis after quietly setting up and more than most can stand under such circumstances. Rea doing so much with his face, his eyes, he does not need too much. He just * is * - his character, so frustrated after long, at one point, driving frustration, he actually says he would rather get 3 at one time than none of a year. Of course it does not mean that he wants more people to die, he just wants some indication to catch the man. Rea makes us feel this man. It makes us understand, but a glimpse into what it is to live with such horrors and uselessness. <br /> A mutant to be sure, Chikatilo's childhood is one that produces like "monsters." Characters in Chikatilo are very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. It somehow (impossible if it may seem) exudes some modicum of sympathy for himself. Maybe it is the worst of you go terribly wrong? Either way, its performance is very well done. Donald Sutherland as Col. Fetisov (later in General) also did a great job. It starts out seems to have a cynical official world that does not seem more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocked Burakov. But it eventually becomes more than just an assistant, it is actually actively involved in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist has brought in helping profile and figure out what kind of disturbs are looking for. Although this movie deals with a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it really is more about what it takes to catch an assassin than the killer himself. All around a beautiful film made with fine performance and a great scenario. The scenario manages to do the best of this kind of movie making: giving real events & putting them meaningless inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people * behind * reality. from 10 stars
