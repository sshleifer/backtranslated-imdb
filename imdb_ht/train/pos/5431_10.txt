I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it I can not help but be entertained by it. Gunga Din is one of the Classic Movies that was held in Golden Years Hollywoods when the actors themselves were required to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and people made "monsters" to bring a scene. Charisma of screen and comraderie demonstrated by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are Suberb and many fun to watch. The tongue and breath attitude in which the three actors play their role as beutifully and optimally. Some might consider it "corny" but I consider it "classic" movie and act in its best. One must remember when watching this film that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from horrors of war and to be entertained and taken to a place where people were bigger than life They made heroic works and good would always conquer about evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors while escaping their harrows. In short, it's a classic movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the audience either.
