This is definitely one of the best standing-up shows. EVER. Eddie is so on the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years now, and still rocks every single time. Just all things come out of his big big physical comedy down to the little on the top of the top side remarks, it's a masterpiece. You need to look beyond that line "Grass in words. You say humble, and we say grass, kuz is a ### ing h in it." Brilliant.
