This is a beautiful, spirit-restored movie. From the use of the real Villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel of the 1920s in the inspired casting, each choice was perfectly right! The joy of this movie is not hated after repeatedly repeated. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright have appeared to play these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April release on DVD in a widescreen format.
