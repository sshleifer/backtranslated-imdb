But how can you stand in touching a baseball team that can not win. For George Knox, it's not easy. As the movie opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) will ride on the thier bikes around the Angels Stadium. Returning home to Foster's mother, Roger is supposed to have a visit from his father (Dermot Mulroney). Her mother dies! And when he asks for his father when he is going to be a family again, he's fathering jokes "I say when the angels win the championship division" so later on, Roger and J.P hid in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When Knox's knight (Danny Glover) takes out her pitcher, the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him, and soon the angel team gets into the fight that gets Knox unloaded out of the game. Night Roger makes a prayer, for the angles to win the championship. When her foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to a baseball, Roger sees the angle really coming out on the field and helps the kite fielder (Matthew McConaughey) to make a catch, leaving the manger and play-by -You find man (Jay Sanders) how he did. Roger learns from the head of the angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles, because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
