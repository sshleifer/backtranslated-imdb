If you were born around this time this movie was over, and it had a home with a liberal / open mine that I was sure during the early 80's you should first introduce them to your parent watch movies or extreme movie theater. You know, not 100% porn but rather an almic mix of current drama and pornography, or that you would sneak into the collections and pop into the plastic rectangle representation of such a movie in a large docking machine called a VHS. You've got to be very quiet with ninja as though they still have minor heart failure when their pop-up noise is done when pressing the tablet-like buttons out of fear to be discovered. Whatever the case, such films are sent to the back of your head, waiting and waiting to be assembled with such visual "art". Needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description of a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to my being desensitized, I am more disturbed by the intricacies. Does the creator talk to us about the deeper level of human venominess and or what can be considered a true abomination, interaction relations, masturbation frame boards, voyeurism, or it might be desperate for social status at the point of murder, pedophile / inversion , or the sexual reproductive nature of women elitist women in the 18th century France? Who can say, but despite Mr Borowcyzk 's gossip for living, raw sexuality was "the norm" for his work, I would say that this movie really speaks to the viewer on a deeper level regarding better karnality. Once I learned this, the story has become much more interesting than the giddiness of the shock and rainforest, it is well worth the effort.
