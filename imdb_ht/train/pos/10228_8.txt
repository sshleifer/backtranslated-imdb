When a big fan of monster, I see "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing a lot about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was able to get a very easy copy, and it was happily surprised by watching that this flash was actually, dare I say, decent. <br /> <br /> Distinct for what it is, actually, namely a giant monster flicker movie. It kicks off very quickly as Yeti gets pretty much instantly, and we get to feature various characters. They consist of some soldiers, some good people, and a girl who is pretty much one of the girls most strangely strikingly beautiful in any movie sci-fi cheese, by far. <br /> <br /> Yti looks like a time -haired straight guy from the Woodstock original concert, and really, it is not that bad in a dude, especially after presenting the world to some kind of funky cage . Godzilla is he who does not - despite awakening his crude, he does not even rampage (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but somehow looks like riddled while trying to figure out things out. Yeti seems to understand English very nicely (my duplicate in English) and he knows the good guys and bad guys. <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti doing her stuff, and it's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, it seems to change a lot a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch People on the "false feet" shots of him just stand there. /> Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good people here. A scene where yti breaks into a warehouse does very well, and in another, it uses windows in a building as "ladder ladder" to climb down from the top of - crush every window with his feet, and often shocking occupiers They are inside - in one sequence that really looks great, better than it should be in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never stoops as low as saying, "APE" does. Actually the only time she even comes close to genuine earnest is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipples to become erect and he lifts his eyebrows in a "oh yeah baby" way. But even this is not bad, and the same kind gets a laugh from the viewer. The movie is very long for this kind of thing, but surprising enough it does not get boring - History is actually good, and just watch this gorgeous gorgeous actress on screen doing any male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the upper coolant of giant monster cops, but it is definitely better than other King Kong '76 rip-offs such as "APE" and "Queen Kong" not very far away .
