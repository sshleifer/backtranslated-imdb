2 TIME: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie has everything in it. Comedy makes me laugh, Drama makes me cry with one of the greatest dance races Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The act was head of any independent film. Jeremy Earl has been in the past since seeing her missionary on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with precision dynamite and dynamics to understand the latest view of a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next emerging of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My Bus ... It's ... Gone" That was the true turning point in the movie. My grandmother loved sooo sooo much that I bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears in your eyes and heat to your heart as you see Tony Donato's white and African American Nathan Davis bail. Through thick (being kept up to point knife) and thin (Nathan advises Tony on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and from conquered Hollywood.
