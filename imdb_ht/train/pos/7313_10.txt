There are some trailers If you're a big fan of horror movie, then you'll know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitating, never doubled, this movie is a classic horror classic and is definitely one of the creepy movies ever made, if not the most horrible. <br /> I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (not asking me why). I honestly see the other movies 7 before seeing this one is just how it worked out. But I should say this one blow all the others go. She is really scared, and sees Michael pop out of behind a bush or walk in the dark to send a chill down your spine. My favorite part of the film was when Michael sew a guy, and leaned himself on one side. It is one of the error images of movie history. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, like Friday 13th movies, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I do like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all of the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a cruel frightening because it is realistic, you could imagine a crazy guy like him going around killing people. I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. What's great about this movie is that it does not rely on Gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just more scary. It's too bad the later films of the series swayed out of this one, because this is as good as an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.
