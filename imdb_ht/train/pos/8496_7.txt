Wow, it was my last year since I saw this film. Looking at it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. Initially I did not think I would do it in the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it difficult to watch her. It has incorporated all negative stereotypes into Americans. If that was not bad enough, once the youngest American city worker showed the image only got worse. On the Japanese opposite spectrum was presented as emotional, workaholic robotics. The film was not all that funny, I only hanging in because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continue to look at. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, the judges swayed by how you finished the round. This film comes from about a three to seven I rated it because of the finish. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious finish and this was just that. It was great that the city was kept working and holding the factory, but that was the most special thing was the marriage between Japanese customs and American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high score.
