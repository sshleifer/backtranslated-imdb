I'm really surprised this movie did not get a higher rating on IMDB. It is one of those movies that can easily be found by someone, but for romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in a class alone. It's the setting and ethnic charms that people seem to take for granted. The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie. Some movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's funny too. **** from *****
