Perhaps the most exciting and clever croaking cop movie is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks End,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the 'Weeping Night' novel by Frank Rosenberg ... <br / > Dana Andrews is honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superior because he loves his own-strong method as he detests crooks ... when he hit someone, his right sore. .. And the man he wants to hit is a cruel list (Gary Merrill) that points up the title. 'Why are you still trying to push me into the gutter? He asked Andrews. 'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! they are illegal to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice has become spoiled in private vendetta ... <br /> <br /> Not a twist of unique irony in the movie itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in 'Laura' to unite Once more, Andrews now seems to play the same detective a few years later, but not the romantic, beating down to his work, not the cheap Crooks ... this time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect ... The kill is accidental, the victim is worthless, but it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail ... <br /> Use his knowledge of police procedures, he covers up his party in the crime, fake pointers, and try to implicate a gang leader, but he can not avoid investigating the case himself ... The double fake strain to expand the major case of its conclusion without en plotting itself in the assassination, is very well preserved and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise. The film is one of the best detective films in the 50's, and values Curious moral, also one of the finest Preminger's ... <br /> <br /> Preminger uses a powerful story story story, designing prestigious angle angles and touches the specifics of the rare in order to maximize his suspicions of realism. ..
