I saw work Room several times and is probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. <br /> <br /> In this one, Stan and Ollie are sweeping chimneys and get the job in the fireplace of the house of Prophet Noodle (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is experiencing crazy in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause many chaos to try to clean up the fireplace and make a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodles use for its experience and this turns it into a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls down the stack and loads of brick on his head, but does not seem to suffer much pain. <br /> <br /> Work room is Stan and Ollie of the funniest. Great fun. <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
