Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS movie as almost unbearably sensitive. While I'm checking here at IMDb is hoping someone had good sense to buy their rights and put it on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I keep hoping - deep sigh. <br /> One of the two lead actors went to a small career primarily at the first evening soap; The other, Frances Lee McCain, has seen the small role here and there for some years. But nothing has been done before or after all matching this little movie that has been produced, as I recall it, on a series of little-lived PBS featuring original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playbacks. I watched him every time he showed up on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was the previous VCR era, so I did not have any records on it, except in my mind's eye. <br /> 12/31/2006 addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned into the writer's own writers.
