Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, everyone is walking on it. Then his friend, a writer of books does not have a love, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss to leave it. She intends to spend the rest of her life doing a great deal of money and sleep with a lot of women. And he managed to do just that. If it was not for the number of deaths (kill / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, this would be a farce. There are many scabies in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. Jean-Louis Trintignant is a lovely amorable romantic. Romy Schneider is in her most appealing. Definitely worth a look.
