This game is amazing. Really, you should get it if you do not have it. Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friends and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it that we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario fans it's essential. It's fun and challenging. All that you might want from a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it came from 1996.) ROCK on 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
