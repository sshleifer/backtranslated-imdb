Personally, I enjoyed cutting ever. It was the first time I saw a theatrically released Australian slasher flicker. There is a normally restricted film on the Hollywood mainstream film. With all the fantastic fantastic comedies and plays from Australia I liked being able to see a homegrown horror movie that was not a rip off of anything. I did not even think it was really a parody of other films. It was a supernaturally term horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, by Call or I know what you did last summer and therefore was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it's about time Australian movie tried to get more of the mainstream styles. <br /> <br /> Cut was original, scary enough and finally just a bit of fun. I would give it seven out of ten and would not treat it as serious. He did what I expected to do, entertain and scare me enough time to be satisfied. I loved it.
