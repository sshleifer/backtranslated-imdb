to communicate in essential movies in life - like what life, does it have a meaning? - is absolute impossible. Of course, possible answers to these questions are shown in each film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal of consciousness. This happens if the views from the senses overrulate the "opinion" of our ideas, is our thinking. Some directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky is one. "Stalker" it shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and again save yourself. I think of De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
