The plains are a fun, no doubt classic, which is even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best actors who played western heroes of their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, nobody knows I've played it better than her. Though it might not be historically accurate, the film manages to take the most important on Hickok and on time to take place. Sometimes you have Storytelling to make your point and that DeMille is doing here. Friendship Hickok and Buffalo Bill, selling Indian rifles by a major manufacturer to compensate for the loss it had because of the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the relationship between the difficulties between Buffalo Bill, a religious woman, and a Hickok The man who has been killed, many strange things between Hickok and Calamity, all make the 'Plainsman' a non-conventional and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which already shows what a great actor he has to become. A lot of care was taken to showcase the original weapons at that time.
