Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since it has no connection to the first two demons films. And with the "III demons" of the title, one would assume it would be. The problem is that this movie never intended to be part of the demon series. Distributors are only a "demons III" above its original title "The Ogre" of cash in on other film films. The new release of the American DVD in this picture has titled "The III Devils: The Ogre" on the box art but the movie itself only tells the "Ogre". I do not know if past releases were titled "The Devils" on the current film itself, but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. If you can find the past "Demons III" in the title, you might have some fun in the "Ogre". It starts out with an intro creep, and it remains very crap at all. There are no throat and movie films slowly but I'm always digging it. Just do not expect it to be like the other devil films. I give the "Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it out.
