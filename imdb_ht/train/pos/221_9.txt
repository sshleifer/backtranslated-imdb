I remember seeing this movie on Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I did not really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh loudly. <br /> With respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this movie. His performance is amazing - giving the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. Types are first-rate. ("You know what kind of song he wrote? Sh * t!" And when talking with the Spanish guy in the front desk: "No, no, no enchilada!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> /> Kudos Richard Benjamin, who played straight man in Matthau. <br /> I just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording will become a bit old. <br /> I had no interest in seeing the rumor and Woody Allen, because in no way she can match the original.
