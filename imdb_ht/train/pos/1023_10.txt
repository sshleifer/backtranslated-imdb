This show has escaped me from reality for the past ten years. I will unfortunately miss it. Although Atlantis has filled the pit somewhat. <br /> <br /> Last ever episode of SG1 (on television anyway) was very well done. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if he was trying to explain what he was like about the series of shows. (Everyone who works well together for a long time has tie-ups and downs. But over the years they have been back to a family). I thought this was a wonderful way to end the criticism of anyone else. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special with time and time again it took me across the limit of disbelief and amazement. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From one episode I was hooked. The blend of action, science, drama and especially comedian worked well that made me want more. There is no real word in which to fully express what this show me. I can only thank those who kept the show for cool and fun for many years. He inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible. <br /> I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope that there will be a number of them. I never want to show off dead. <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
