This is an odd movie for me, as after reviewing a nice movie from a new movie maker (Far Out by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me, to watch and review his movie, The Cure. I do not normally review the movie this way, but what the heck - I like shorts and could not wait to see another. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, while it turned out I did like the CURE, I was not happy about it and let Jafri know. For his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway - giving it my honest evaluation. The movie has tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction, it's exceptional - especially for those films an inexperienced experience maker (it's his first movie). The combination of exceptional choices in color, rhythm and music that well suited the movie has created a great sense of atmosphere. You really are pulling in the movie and that's a movie credit done. However, things I did not like were some of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the finish was just too easy to predict. I really would like to finish the finish it came as more of a surprise or there was an unexpected twist. However, considering that this film is from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film to give his experience, it bodes well for his future. Good job.
