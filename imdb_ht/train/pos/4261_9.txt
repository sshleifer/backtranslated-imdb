I adore this movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although it's practically all of the German movies that count. However, because it is NOT the main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch Julietta 2001, and who really brings this movie to his shoulders. A family is moving from Italy to Germany seeking "German dreams" (this is my own and ironic invention ...) of cheap labor in steel industry and coal. However, to finish opening a restaurant and the movie tour to take at this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point, the story is said to be especially those of the two brothers in this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Rigi Gigi has become a cinema threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - the look at which life can be formed by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie does not say that life (the Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or Fuller or more interesting. It simply gives us a rewarding glimpse of what it must love to seek identity when two countries and mentality are involved. and this watch does not drive by bitter or disgraced in either country, making it such a great movie for any and all countries to cope with the immigration tensions. The fact that the director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also confessed to this film a great measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake is fantastic performances not thrown at all, especially Metschurat and - this I really need to stress - the little boy who plays young Gigi. This child's performance would be a tough act to follow by just about anyone! Great movie, go see it.
