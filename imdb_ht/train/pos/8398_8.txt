A realistic illustration of young love for college but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and makes me shed a water or two. We rarely see movies and blacks in town that might appeal to older, black audiences and show a more real real-life of young adult blacks. This film takes place in a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are various friends friends and situations that affect them for better or worse. Some typical drawings may say, but that's really unexpected. <br /> I found myself rooting coping in the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in the stories. The moment of deep thinking and revelation was pouring out of the actors' performance. <br /> It's a bright movie that I would endorse for those youngsters at heart and in love or have ever been in love. Great movie. I'm looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
