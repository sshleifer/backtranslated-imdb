There really is not much to say about this movie .... it's bit, but fun. <br /> <br /> Two drawings from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invented a new game of basketball play, using baseball rule. When the game becomes a big success, with the help of a billionaire, form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change their city. Coop & Remer's team, Beers Milwaukee is the only team that stands in the way of changing the rules that the owner of Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of Southpark, Parker and Stone do a very good job in their first real movie. <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie I can not come close to naming them all. It never really lets up, and does not try to put some cruddy drama into making it worse. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's GREAT. I especially like "Take Me On" and "Beer" by Big Fish. Very confused. <br /> In general, a bit, but very funny, movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
