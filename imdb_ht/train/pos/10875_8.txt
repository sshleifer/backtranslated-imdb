Australia's first films endstream slasher hit the screen with a bang. With a stitch. With a slice. With a cry or two. With lots of blood, frights, erotic red and very laughing. <br /> In fact, there are plenty of first-round encounters - it's the first of Dave Warner's script to be produced, although it has several others either option or negotiation; it's the first major film director and Guru Hoodoo former Kimble Rendall; and it is also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a bunch of guys soak their toes in this genre for the first time, they are sure to know things. <br /> <br /> Catch the storytelling of a bunch of Australian films that hear about a slasher, Hot Blooded movie, which never ended because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the movie. Although the conferences (assistant director of Hilary's night were killed) warned that every time someone tries to start producing Hot Blooded again to die, Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decided to go forward and complete the movie. They put together a crew and managed to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, in the original location - they end up hot bloody ?? 14 years after shooting close. <br /> <br /> Of course, this being a slasher movie, much of bloodletting claiming ?? long and very lazy, some good discomfort and a rocking Aussie band. Cutting shows that Australia can do a good, mass-market horror film as well as Hollywood. <br /> It's a well-crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a crafty draw with a killer - Scarman - that's a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
