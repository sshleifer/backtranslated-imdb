Very good west. This was Richard Wilson's first-time writer to direct a movie, all this was the first one for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to this city dominated by prohibiting and is hired as a city bustle, but people are worried that he will go too far, too on the wrong that he will do in the city businesses. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" that were made in 1959. This film holds a very fast and exciting speed, it really keeps you on the edge.
