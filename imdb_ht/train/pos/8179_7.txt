This would be so fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. There is a pleasurable pleasure corner in my movie tasting that really appreciates movies really well done. Sometimes because people usually have strong feelings about dental. Perhaps the ADA launched a campaign against it, since the dentists reported being excused for this movie and the "Marathon People" (which only has one comparable scene with many of the "Dentists"). It is amazing to remember that according to the trivia page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post production can take longer than film sometimes and the correction for the "Dentist" is perfect picture. Quick cuts increase the tension so much that at the stage where the dentist "cares" in his wife has only two quick cuts showing what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imagination! Corbin Bernsen has been a good choice for the role since she has a lot of experience playing psychologically "cut" character and it completely sells obsessive compulsive aspects to the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me the rhythm of the movie was just right. The movie makers reveal the wife's habits in just the right way. All of the characters in the dental office look like they are real people working in a real office. There are many strains while dealing with patients who wait for the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile the dentist is off on the break in a huge psychotic breakdown! Contrary to many movies in this genre, the script is very very tight. All the victims fall into the dental trap in highly calculated ways. Two types of law enforcement even participate in a little board that ends up creating a shocking at a confrontation near the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of the heart or teeth-fobic, but a real coaster roller coaster and highly recommended for fans of clever gorefests.
