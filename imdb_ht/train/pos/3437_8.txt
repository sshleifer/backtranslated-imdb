Some genre movies need to be dressed. This one was an exception. Take on its own merit, it's a down version of the horror genre movie. With minimal special effects, he managed to be a psychological study of qualities, with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus, and why he? It's not a big movie, yet because there's little bit about it, the story works. Subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters. Actually, there is one constraint in the opening scenes, but it may have been laid simply to put the tone for what is coming. I greatly appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some sympathy, value the need for a bit of adventure in your life, and ask "What would I do in this situation?"
