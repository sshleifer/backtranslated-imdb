"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of these 80-year-old bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-colored bush where everyone is attracted, some easy-to-solve conflicts that occasionally take away from the especially happy, and vast number of drawings are summarized by mounting bouncy pop tunes. There is nothing wrong with this, however. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally gained on the cornball cheese as we had fun in it, and in the end, as embarrassing as this is admitted, we applauded (and we saw this in the path in our living room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
