Not God, it was a long time since I saw that. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The movie tells us (children) all about blood and the circulatory system. Very professional put together - Disney-style animation, more human actors - led by Frank Capra, for debt burst! <br /> kind of an overkill. I wonder if the value of production is very high is worth the amount of money in a movie-film is worth to information about the human body? But the boys are kids watching her learn: even now, I can well remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material is most similar to human blood, which the doctor immediately responds "sea water."
