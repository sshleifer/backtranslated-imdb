This was a gem. Amazing acting out to lead them to Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all in support. The film raises a topic not only important in Ireland and Irish history but in many communities around the world and many wedding units in these communities. With the intensities and sincerity of the film shows how religious convictions and traditions have been driving a tightly trusted family to love and passionate. The title "Love Divide" could not take it any better. Though it was a true story and happening in Ireland in the 50th, see how the life of the village and village pogroms are beginning to remind me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature. Just like in the movie Liam Cunningham's character says "The hatred has always been under the surface". It was interesting to look at the moral choices made in this story. Also the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite meaningful. The story however gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Character Liam Cunningham goes to the whole transformation of the course of the story to become a man he always wanted. Once again acting is a top tooth. History is fast-paced. The Irish Country is as beautiful as ever. Very recommended.
