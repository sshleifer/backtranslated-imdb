This is what I call a growth movie. Each character is different and better in the end - and it's all because a woman knows that the place to choose is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedy, really shines as the woman who carries on all these changes. Even those guys in this movie came from being self-centered to the best men. The book remained very true in the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian. The sulfur-taking landscape and the message of genuine love.
