A group of friends decided to take a camping trip through the desert - and found themselves assailed and murdered by a mysterious assassin in a black pick-up truck. "Mirage" is obviously inspired by Spielberg's "Lut" and Craven in the "eyes hills" .Also this Slasher Wire offers plenty of nasty and gore violence. The fascinating movie composer is a sequence involving a man with arms His legs and legs chained together around a tree and then its branches have been released when the chain is pulled by a truck. is also a little bit of suspense and some interesting circle-and-cut sequences.The action is beautiful lame and the script is quite weak, but the movie is fast-paced and shocking.BGSteers that play the villain is justice threatening. Where the deserts provide some atmosphere and the gor is rather strong. Generally, if you like low-budget support budgets give this one a look.8 out of 10.
