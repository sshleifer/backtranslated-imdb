I recently got the chance to see the "Waterdance", and well loved it. I do not really understand why its calling that no really any dance will be on there, except perhaps for the dance of the strip club near the end. We present to the main characters of the movie, unreliable in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically civilian guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you do not get to see movies like that today. I'm not "stuck in a chain of time", I do not say that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the film industry is deteriorating and there is plenty we can learn from the old cinema- By my old cinema I mean anything from 1920-1998.
