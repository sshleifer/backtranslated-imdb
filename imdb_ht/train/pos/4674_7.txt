What percentage of people's movies are going to see the days left to ask what happened to eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: too many! This movie is not like that. It's a real-life story that is sometimes a combination of both likable and unjust. <br /> <br /> Downside: <br /> <br /> Not enough character development & some drawn lines left twisting in the wind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Well done by Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, in Essandoh and Elliot Short. <br /> There are some good humor humor.
