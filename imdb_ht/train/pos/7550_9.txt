Wow. A really fantastic movie 'tour' with tons of super-surreal imagery, dark intentions and a black, very unusual sense of how animal creatures must see the world. It is populated with a very beautiful bunch in the world of characters folding and shining with deformation.As backgrounds and all cool fantasy, the wandering plot is high of the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat with her zombie sister folks They meet death, humor, water elephants, thirsty samurai and fish pigs. I'd never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminds me of the surreal-work pencil in American design; Bill Plympton. It's a fun hobby for fans of odd, wonderful and it was my glued to the screen for fear I'd miss something amazing. Simply put, it's 'Hello Kitty' without the 'o'.
