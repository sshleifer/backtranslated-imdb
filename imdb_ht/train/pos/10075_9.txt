"Mask" is a moving movie that works on many levels. In its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street scene that is fine with a toddler while trying to pass along with his creative art (mask) in the next generation. Although, at times the story makes the old man in a job, it is so well fabricated (writing, acting, directing, wonderful production value), it is easy to move further his behavior. And, if you hang with it, the movie is finally very sweet and uplifting. Kudos all around. This is a wonderful movie for kids as well as adults. The trick is how to get Americans who can not like foreign movie films to see it!
