This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong movie action. In addition to drawing little, the weak drama and bits of comic acting, the film is action packed with fighting weapons and martial arts actions. Let me keep in mind from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was scared of the movie. <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps Hong Kong action going strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
