This is apparently noted in the second of this film, being filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in many ways he reminds me of the film later, A Yank at OXFORD. Both films are concerned with a tough blow that occurs in one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, the show-trick shows slowly learning about teamwork and descent. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rivals, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a support role is Jack Pickford - always remembering the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford from the best, like the sympathetic loser who gets Tom Tom - it actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clicks are there and the movie, because it did many times before and since, offers some surprises. However, it is nice movie and is look enjoyable. <br /> In my opinion, for a better college movie silence, try Harold Lloyd's frustration - its football scene frankly more interesting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than Tom Brown's annoying. The FRESHMAN is probably the best photo college you can find in the era. Another reason BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is that William Haines has played essentially the same character with the bomb and the same draw again and again and again (as in the WESTPOINT and SMART SET, among others ) - and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly NOT original! And, because it's just a rehash in her other movie, anyone giving the movie a score of 10 is strangely advised to see these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this small movie was the highest rated movie on IMDb from the 1920s! Talk about over rated! There are dozens and dozens of best films - how this movie happened # 1 is to guess anyone.
