I do not have much to add to what has been said before, but it's a lot of film in it's time, and first (and the only chance) when the studio hung the movie totally on dead dying kids. > <br /> The Warner gave the boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and an 'A' budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At every turn, we get one of these gem performance from real benefits. They are too many in list, but it looks like just about everyone on Warner's many (the very essence of the stars are bigger) walking in this picture. (See if you can be near John Ridgely) <br /> Only on top performances is out of earnest Eduardo Cianelli as a boss and a messianist complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". It is something to look! And Marjorie Main is excellent and has improved her role since "Dead End". <br /> I bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill and something like "City for Conquest". <br /> Hooray for Warners!
