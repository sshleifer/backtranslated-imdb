This is a very well-made film, meticulous LED and with some excellent acting characters that at times is deeply moving - for example the scene and cop sidekick's loyal but sophisticated and his wife. The plot is compelling to work out and interesting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. It made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters. <br /> A couple of small reservations: I found a little one-sided unfinished as it celebrated the success of the Hero's integration into the structure of the police and justice system, which collapsed ambiguity of the police characters who held up this point. Also I found lead female characters somewhat weak: little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all it seems to do is cry and swoon as the hard guys fight it out.
