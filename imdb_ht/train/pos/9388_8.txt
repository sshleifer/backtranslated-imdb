Many of your precarious readers, Cage and Hopper met and fortunately not in a Lynch movie ?? because RED ROCK WEST is a better way than any Lynch movie ??. Nicolas Cage is a third rate actor ?, the porcelain babe is a femme femme fatal, only papa Hopper is as mean as ever ??. WHITE ROCK WEST is, despite the cast cast, one of my favorite American schools; in a word, a thriller and some twists .. One especially the gusto's notice, the awesome speed, the emotions, the lovely suspicion, Lara Flynn Boyle's tight little ass, the privilegableable physical shape of the cage (though unbearable ugly, and sharp features, thick eyebrows and thin, unhealthy hair, cages appear to be fine overall ??), Hopper's complete routine, some moderately, but really funny, playing the cage with his intentions, the rigid hopper , Attractive Psychopathy, the Lamaras, Cages looks like a roamer, archetypal gullible roamer in the movie noir, hungry, difficult if needed, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle does as the cold seductress means, Walsh as her husband, husband and hopper as the Lynchian hit-man he had previously done. <br /> <br /> Cage looks quite ugly or dizzy or very confused and has a great hangover. But this might look regular to him.
