From Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer and his movies by putting his film world in over the midst of the real world and the imagined world. So as viewers we think we look at a "true" story while in fact we are well manipulated, often in the point that the movie works disturbing (Dancers in the Dark) or painful (Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, Dogme's film has been acting only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some Spotlight on the Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealist, looks like his relationship with everyone else, but quickly becomes the victim of the problems that others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to remain idealism and become the terrorist. Humanity is spoiled and pervaded only leads to (self-) destruction. (These elements were also very always in Breaking Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The movie also full of cynical (even funny) undertones on the role of German and Americans in the aftermath of Germany. /> As a successful film technique is beautifully designed: shifting and fading color washing, extreme screen, action on different overlays (and the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). In this film, we can see how good Trier Trim in film as a technical means. In his later work he seems to step down from this (as if he is not yet interested in achieving the techniques because they become so easy to use).
