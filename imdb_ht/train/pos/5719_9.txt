As I've noticed with a lot of commentary IMDb, certain evaluators seem to require that each film they see they have smart smugly scheme that has lower their own intelligence. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, bullets and heroic. If I look at a comedy, I want to have tears in my eyes. You get the idea. Therefore, watching a horror movie, I primarily want to be scared. The reason is a very scary movie, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's craggy imagery. I was a fan of movie horror for many years, and I talked about their masters like Dario Argento, rather than some directors of the kid's horrible flirting kid that they churned out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Fewer way than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I think is also a big movie).
