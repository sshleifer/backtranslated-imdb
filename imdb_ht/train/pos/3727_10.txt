Tigerland is one of the finest films that I've seen, and in my opinion it's outdoes even full of metal jacket, a movie of nature. Bozz played exceptionally well by Farrell, and he is a character who lives in your head long after the movie ends. The finish is brilliantly cut off by Schumacher - with the melody melody song and the word slowly into the prepared troops to leave. What a movie.
