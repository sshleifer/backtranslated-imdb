Symmetry peach is a beautiful episode and a few faults. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho. Big Season 'Season One' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also southwest of Idaho. I wonder if the forces strength when they are one and the same but they decide to use the real name of Symmetry Peach. Mulder and Scully have some good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of anger, old school teacher. To be loved by the child at one time, you just can not imagine how. Just like it must have been caring for animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt it was some inconsistency. If foreigners are so admitted to kidnap people and return them safely, why can not they put the beast back to the right place? And the aliens are just now having trouble returning the animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuity. As if it is an expert on that. I also thought Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose had not done well. In addition to the nitpicks, I still enjoy this episode because of the intriguing concept of alien reptile animals as well as human DNA.
