ANCIENT FISHER is the story of an emotionally troubled Navy American marine kid. Her problem was brought to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helped her realize that her problems stem from childhood education. <br /> Get ready to sink a water or two. The film could thaw the coldest heart. I liked the story, which turns out to be something so awful to happen to anyone in a positive end. ANIMAL FISHER is a powerful, most important film about forgiveness. Other important issues that you think are child abuse, adoption, and foster care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington does an impressive job at his first director. There were many scenes that I liked watching. They are included in the beginning (dreaming of a small boy to check out the gigantic-sized pancakes!) And the finish (dreams back to reality), which very well tied the story together. Another beautiful scene was made by the doctor encouraging to seek out for his family to find answers to her questions about her abandoned family. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene came when the young man finally confronted his mother and his reaction to her. Priceless. <br /> All actors represent the parties well. In addition to responsibility directly, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar award and has been successful in all his actors' role. He has a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor, Derek Luke demonstrates why he was so good for the Fisher party. It has described very real and heart-tugging tasks. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant who played the part of Cheryl, The Loving Interests, looked like a sun rays on the screen. The chemistry flows well between the romantic characters. Novella Nelson plays part of Ms. Tate, a jerk character, deserves special mention. A few minutes, the actress who played the Fisher's Mother gave an outstanding performance. Everyone should see FISHER ANTWONE.
