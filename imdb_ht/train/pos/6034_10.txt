Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I must say it was a lot of fun. A few technology errors aside, it was a great experience. I liked writing and acting, especially in the guy who played the lead role. There are a lot of hearts in this film, a lot of understanding. I had a chance to talk to a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed really nice. All in all the movie was just a positive experience, and one I would definitely recommend. The story was fun and cool, as a woman I was in a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I could really understand her problem because of her. The film does a great job to give people whom we can sympathize with. The friends of the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like these, I only want to be Imy's friends and I could sound like cool like these people when we talk. The movie all is just real cool, I wish there were more movies out there like it. <br /> - Jayden
