Mary Poppins is definitely better, but this is a beautiful movie nonetheless. Angela Lansbury is beautiful dotty as Angletine Price, and David Tomlinson has many fun as Mr. Brown. Chemistry was just as brilliant as well. Children, however, just miss the same brightness, though Paul is very funny and beautiful. The songs were actually not as bad as some say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact, all the songs are exceptional. The special effects were beautiful, which had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough. The highlights, though, like Mary Poppins, were animated sequences. The underwater sequence was nice, but my favorite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other critic is that I did not quite get the finish when I first saw it. All in all, a beautiful movie, which is hardly ever on. 8/10 Bethany Cox
