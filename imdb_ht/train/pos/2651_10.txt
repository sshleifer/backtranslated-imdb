That's right. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just so much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about people in my comment on the mini series. But I missed a few. The shotgun film is in a better place than the mini-shot series. And the REDRUM scenes are creepier than those in the book. So, if you're looking for a big movie, get Stanley Kubrick's shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
