I, like many horror fans, have been strengthening the same great ban on the Hollywood budget renewal and the MTV High School slasher thrust for the last 20 years. Here, at last, is an original movie genre movie that ticks all the boxes right. <br /> You want a warm lead actress, you want to vampire, you want fresh guns, you want cool cars and you want to be bloody, lots of it, not the bucket load - you got it. <br /> With excellent fighting choreography and a support role from the Queen Hammer Horror Queen reindeer Stephanie Beacham, this really is fantastic. <br /> Although it's low budget, does not choose to use 35 mm stocks and adds CG effects to the mixed mix, director James Eaves has created something that feels bigger. <br /> A must for old school horror fans.
