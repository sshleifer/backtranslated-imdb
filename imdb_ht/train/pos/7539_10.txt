I really enjoy watching this movie. like most of those who watched it. I was not sure that I got. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedy and has made a lot of funny movies; This sister acts. <br /> However this was not really comedy. It's a drama and comedy moment. So, if you are looking for a laughing riot then keep looking. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a dark family moving from a beautiful neighborhood to the city in a top neighborhood. I would say more but he thinks he would spoil the movie. This film does not just deal with race relationships between white and black, but also on relationships with the black community. I think it's worth a chance. if you are not really interested in seeing another movie about race relationship then this movie is not for you
