Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter. He and his father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive in the streets by the time con artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a cheap garage garage while Curly will scream on lawsuits and traction victims of intent. He came to a very prolonged attorney named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who was appropriately surprised at what he did. Not only do the scammers do some cash, they get to spend the night at Plush Gray's apartment. Even then, Gray feels that they must be more so three of them hang together for a spell. Gray only knows business law lucrative and nothing about life. Who better to teach him than Bill and Curly, these experts are savvy about the reality of life? But good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of boys con. Or have there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as fun as Shirley Temple, but many edges, of course. Belushi provides a rare touching performance as it comes down to its luck and Lynch is glowing as the attorney touches but soft but also. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us touching his magic once again, as the script is alive and unpredictable. Just look curly and bill take gray out for a night, with no money, and see the funny results. Do you long for the happy ending, long promised and finally delivered, with a moment of uncertainty in between? This movie is made-to-your-order.
