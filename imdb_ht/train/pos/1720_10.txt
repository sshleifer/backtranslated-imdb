This early biography was so fun to watch. The second on one disc in D.W. Griffith's "Year of Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) features three excellent performances by the main and exciting drivers to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, The Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician who gives an eye to the Countess (and other things). The county husband's husband left Berserk in his wife's betrayal and ran to a little room with his armchair. It's incredible that they would not hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (fatherly silent player Raymond Hackett) jetties wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in a way unexpectedly funny. The best time comes to the end. As the lad goes out of shock and fear, once he realizes it ends, Henry picks up his instrument with his "fan" on it. His way of doing it was so unexpected and in a strange way of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed to myself. The expression on his face! From that moment I was seized by Henry B. Walthall.
