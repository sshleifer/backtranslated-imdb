One must admit, that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break from Zeenat Haman, a successful model, and also was the ex-winner of the title descriptive beauty, not casting him into a role that was tailor-made for his first. Watching him, stalking, and balance it into the hypnotizing music, made him an instant darling of the viewers. This film is a treat in the eyes, with its local Scenic, ethnic people, these Buddha temples, and merves, naughty Mumtaz, which seem quite attractive, in ethnic, and dancing skills. Dev is of course, adorable, and this is one of its successful business performance. Hare Rama manages to keep the interest going, and he carefully writes script, editing, and fascinating music. Like Des Pardes, another movie, Anand cares about teenage topics in the habit of drug addiction, and the theory of them from family disturbed, and small children, is quite possible. A good artist, this movie retains it in freshness until date!
