The first time I saw this episode was like a trauma to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". Things speed is happening is amazing, and it is so surprising, thrilling, and even interesting, it's almost as if you read a book; Once you start it, it's very hard to stop. From minutes Richard Walsh spoke in private Jack about the possibility of having a mole inside CTU, I sat 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes! (Silly and crazy sound, but I'm kind of guy when he's interested just can not stop this series) is one of his best qualities. And it's built in a way to have some different stories being connected together. Recommended in every way!
