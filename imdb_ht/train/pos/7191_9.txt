Reed Hadley does a better Don Diego dancer than he does a stupid and daring Zorro, but that's almost around this point because this serial low-quality feature is the best theme song in any series set, ever - and The best version of Yakima Canutt's cinema-based stagecoach stage. There are other good exhibits, with lots of action, and lots of hair-raising cliffs-hanger theme chapters, but if for any other reason, you must see this movie to look at the stagecoach's cascade, then re-look at it slow motion. It's incredible and, despite the lower budget for playing this chapter, Yak turns into a better take on the cascade here than it did in the movie far more celebrating "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, feed your heart out: This is the real deal!
