What was still missing and the Matrix story was how things came into the real world. Say no more, because this part of the story covers most of the bases. What was really interesting was how politics it was, perhaps even a cheap shot in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things people could think of in considering the Battle of Robotics Horde, who meant nothing more than domestic to humanity. What I also found interesting was used in fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. We as people tend to fall into that trap quite often, leaving the lack of logic and thinking about us because people can not believe the contrary. Well represent and put together, this is a true will of how logic can be.
