I am proud to say that I own a copy of the choice in this version of the Creole International-Conducting Cheetah of Sexual Divorce on DVD. It's a really tricky and enjoyable flicking incredible and a breezy sweetheart 70's vibe. She tries to make a heartfelt point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Sure, it's essentially a blatant teenage boy fantasy image - the main character Bobby Hamilton's teen becomes the girls, the respect of his friends, and a chance to show-up a local wind-racing bully - but it's also dopey and good-characteristic ways of hatred. Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affection is a definite cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is as well as appetizing as a Blonde Beauteous babe, and sneering Beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver ( biker 60's endless movie) are lovely lovers like the hug brutal Dugan. A particular Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute revolt as the Carwash Boss owner's mascot, a lovably cantankerous ne'er-made-well nail that wears hotly Hawaiian path and suffers from a gambling habit serious. I especially love the scene where brutal brutal beats Danny up - one keeps his arms behind him while the other guy is working on Danny's torso! With Sammy Johns' insanely catchy song striking song fluke will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's the great groovy retro-70 fun!
