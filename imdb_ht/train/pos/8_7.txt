Very well drama although it appeared in a few empty areas left viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being that way for someone who can not read and write. This film simply sprays into the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the family lives-in and against, the troubled child who gets knocked up and, typically, drops out of school, a husband jackass nest eggs and buy beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
