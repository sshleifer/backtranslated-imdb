Are you ever, or have, a pet that was with you in thick and thin, whom you would lose without, with whom do you love no matter what? Betcha never thinks to feel the same way about you! <br /> <br /> Beautiful, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft spot for animals, this guarantee makes you cry no matter your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid, and I found that now, at age sixteen, I love her as much as I did then. I can never decide on a favorite character then, and I still do not think I can! I love all three of the animals. The dialogue looks very real and comfortable, as a loving, but feuding family. I love luck, and how in the end he says he has a family at last. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this means to be a family movie, and it fulfills this role perfectly. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and shadow is the perfect leader / role model to the young, lucky adventures. The way people outshine people, but of course most of the teary's time must have been during an interaction with them (ie, Molly's salvage, and the end). Not to mention the incredible band that gives even more emotional moments, and a heart-popping feeling. I give this 9/10. To compare to (and even rated better than) cats and dogs and babe.
