Unlike some comments, I'm positive. This movie is wrapped in the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you do not. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. The stories are not one list, happy with everyone and everything, kind of life - much like real life. Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. But like true family and good friends, they stick together. Parents want-to have to buy a baby are such a - hole! You are happy to finish. Poor Delmar is stuck between a stone and a boulder caring for himself, his mother, his son, and trying to keep their lives together. This does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all live in a dream world, but is a very real life painting of people living day to day, month months. In general, this is a good story with a great movie!
