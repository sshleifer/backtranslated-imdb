This film, recently voted as a favorite audience at the 2005 Palm Festival International Film Festival, is inspired and moved. A famous conductor, forced to retire by disease, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader in the church choir, and finally to gain the fulfillment of his music. Drawing on Sweedish's features to keep things in mind and in the insult character of a small village, this film develops each of its characters well. Superbly led, acting and singing songs, bringing tears to eyes, and smiling for everyone. We hope it will get distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see it!
