I chose this one up on a whim from the library, and it was very surprising foreclosure. Many tight, working expressionist cameras, an equally tight script, and two superb actors all meld together make one very good piece of film. Not for the multiplex reptile brain, but rather the true affectionate of the cinema. If Hollywood ever found his threat but I'm sure he'll ruin it. A choice is treated all the way around. Other posters here are more than amply singing his praise, so I do not need to bother copies of their payrolls; just take the tips, and me, and do not miss this gem. Call That You Love; I call it two hours of well-spent entertainment. It's my mouth: do not miss it.
