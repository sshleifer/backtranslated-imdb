For those of you who think anime is just about violent giant Scholler reptile, think again. There is a totally different side of the Japanese animation. Yakite! Japan is one of these shows. It's a sweet-characteristic story of a young man and gifts for making delicious cakes. Its universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match the famous European breeds. The show is as wacky as they come and I make sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of completing the innocent vibe of the show. <br /> In the world of Yakite! It's not uncommon for people to look like they just had an orgasm after eating bread. The pen is hallucinating and can provide the consumer with a wide array of super powers, from time-to-swim swimming like a fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funny shows I've watched in a while.
