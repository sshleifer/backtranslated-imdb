I think he has taken a lot of bowelhead to come forward like that. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers, it helps people most. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I was in the mental health field for five years and I think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word yet and I believe it helped. I still think it was great and always. I'm glad she wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act. She was in a lot and she faced it. I would really like to see her work more with children, especially children actors. His trials should not happen and I think it would be wonderful as an advisor for young people. The movie was so moved to me that I was very touched. Suffering a TBI that made the onset of my illness and having a PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show his life as he did. I believe he has helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that they have help. Thank you Ms. Duke, or Anna, who ever you prefer.
