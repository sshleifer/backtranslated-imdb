From rain, sad late winter to England in the early 1920s ... where there are still sadness and many young widows and veterinarians crippled from the massacre of men and killer of the women's dreams - known now as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this cute little sunny Italian mansion on a hill; one of the young widows drowning in frantic parts, two women who will discover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous deaths ... women will come together with two husband and an old soldier - Nearly blind - to get a "spiritual" makeover for a great April vacation in Italy in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> The note should be filmmaker. Study this movie for how attitudes and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie, please many people ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls on some late tomato pans ... Spring is coming. Enchanted April Promises You!
