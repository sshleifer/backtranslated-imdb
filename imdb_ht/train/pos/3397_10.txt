Soylent Green IS ... a really good movie, actually. I would never think it. I do not really love Heston in his Sci-Fi effort. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manage to come across all the most insurmountable traps and most of the time. I prefer hero most vulnerable. And indeed, he sneers his way to many of Soylent Green, too, but as he supposed to play a bully overconfident I really do not mind. <br /> I can understand why some people would turn their nose up into this movie. Soylent Green does not make any effort to create visual futuristic (what you know - it looks just like 1973), and it lacks action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex society, corruption, and highly stratified, and I was so happy to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving, final comic role. Good moment little characters - as when sharing some precious foods with Heston - really make the movie. The message of Soylent Green is very important these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporation up to. Funny, is not it, to see Heston in a movie prototype Michael Moore ...
