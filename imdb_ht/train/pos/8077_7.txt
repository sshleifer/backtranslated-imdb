A movie made for contemporary audiences. Mars found to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course performing scenes as well. This is not exactly a movie that someone would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. Not for children. I had to be fast before a number of scenes. <br /> If your just entertainment is looking, then this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. A prod production, I must add. However, the message of the film is not universal. He emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you will get good. But if you do wrong, you will get wrong. The fruit of good deeds, while the fruit of evil is wrong. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not find justice in this world. While it is true that some people are wrong to encounter with an evil end, many people are saved. Then, many people do well, and again in return to meet with a regret. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the message, and all you want is an escape from the reality of the world, this film is a well-respected artist.
