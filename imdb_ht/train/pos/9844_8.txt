There are so many movies that are so funny as this one. I was lucky enough to watch this film in a "reserved" movie theater for my film enthusiasts, so it's not so embarrassing to sit laughing until my jaw was completely hurt with my sleeves all wet from wiping my eyes ... <At times the story was a bit "slow", but this is perhaps the best - a bit of the rest-between the roller amongst the halls (I almost fell out of the chair ...) was most welcome.
