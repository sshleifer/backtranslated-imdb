This review comes almost 30 years late. But it must be mentioned that I was chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in the beginning of 2008 and watch it repeatedly for 4 months right! I just had to write about it! I got hit and forget anything else existed once I saw this movie. How ironically it is to see the uglyest male protagonist Literature described by the lovely man! again, what a welcome irony! It fits me perfectly, because Timothy Dalton has done all the justice in his role. He released an amazing performance and triumph! I have never seen anything like it! All other actors are also very good. The entire movie was put together very well. I do not care what someone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. He breaks me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 in A & E's P & J, which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> The extracts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in the school. I never got to read the book seriously knowing the story line so well. Seeing particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a close madness. The scene and voice of Mr. Dalton hug me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Bravo of the whole team and especially Mr.Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. <br /> I give it 10/10 rating.
