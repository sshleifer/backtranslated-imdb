I had some reservations on this movie, and I figured it would be the usual bill in price --- a movie about Christmas. When you were in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be one street after another. Ben Affleck was credited to his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivers his lines with a real understanding of him and makes a great "father." <br /> <br /> If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check out this one out.
