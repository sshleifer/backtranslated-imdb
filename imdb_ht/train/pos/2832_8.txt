I saw this film in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this film really hit home. He has received all things; The gap of generation, sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following a "family tradition" of a person seeking human own way of life. <br /> It was a fast paced, very enjoyable movie. Vegas was in her hippiest picks, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous, laughing, controversy, romance, and even a happy ending. A very enjoyable time on all. <br /> Poster in this movie rests on my room walls. I look at it and I'm back in time; a time of my youth and my times and my dad, a great time in my life.
