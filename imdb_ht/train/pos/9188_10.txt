It's too bad many did not understand this with the next episode. <br /> But do not worry! Sick explains it too :) <br /> This episode is split into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. The second part is what's going on in real life. <br /> Now what people did not understand is that Tony's dream is more then just a dream. In this episode read about her preparation for her death. He lost his own identity and eventually even forgot his head, so he disconnected all his engagement with this world. You will notice what I'm saying at the doctor's scene, where Tony says he has lost his purse with his "life". Musicians really did a superb job of interpreting them thinking of what's happening when you die. If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode of something unique, with great spiritual significance. Like every episode sopranos acting and filming is superb. <br /> Only thing I did not understand was that role in the place of the monks. I'll watch it until I get this. <br /> <br /> anyways this episode really touches me, and I do not think anyone else can do a better look at what's happening in an almost death experience. <br /> 10/10 no doubt.
