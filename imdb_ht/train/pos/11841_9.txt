This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5, and 4) all enjoyed this movie, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but instead, the story is said by Spirit. And hearing a story told by the horse's point if it was fun. <br /> I think the title says it all, "smart". This film really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I should say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girls were really touching this movie, and even got so in it, they laughed so hard and are encouraged for the spirit at the end . <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and you have your mind up with this happy story. Your kids will love it. I think you will also.
