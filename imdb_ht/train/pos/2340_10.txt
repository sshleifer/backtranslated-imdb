I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show manages to put a smile on my face and big storytelling, devilish dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: It also managed to keep you until the end. The core idea behind the show - Bring people back to life with one touch, which ends the undead status and a second - is interesting and can still be in later times. But to suspect murder, the unique look of the show and the highly competent narrator adds to the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than it's part. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy and I'm looking forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
