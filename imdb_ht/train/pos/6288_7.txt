GONE OF 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (from four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic picture, slick, stylish action with high power octane stars and very awesome looking automotive. If you are an interested viewer in this production machine, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air," "Rock"), it's worth seeing just at your eyes on the brilliant cars. Although the secret film of a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a successful mild success successful ride. The movie star Giovanni Ribisi ("The Squad of Mod") as a young thief named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive criminal criminals Raymond Calitri a (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life threatens because of these, his older brothers, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a robbery but skilled caretaker, called on to complete a work in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty-specified machines in patterns, colors, years, and make-in only four days. Memphis debri the first three days to recruit a team of villains to help him pull on the heist. The crew includes Sarah Sway Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet scruffy retiree machine known to Memphis in the past, a fellow named TJ Cross, the elderly and the wisest, Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) , as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Take care of the movie and tension is a subplot involving police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who are suspected of having experienced Memphis and his crew They are up to no good and keep an extra eye closed on them. <br /> There is not much time for character development here; The audience has come to know these people even if their lifestyle is resistant and assume hard personality in basic, challenging atmosphere, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the movie, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a cultural cultural tone. I do not claim I think the profanity and vulgar needed for thrillers bloomers; I actually honored the principal's decision to hold success because of extreme language in a movie that could be very horrible to earn a R-rating. However, I believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds," for strongly developing Enlightenment character, dialogue needed to be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> In spite of trouble, the characters are effective due to the top head, perfectly cast responsible performers. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely inappropriate here. Delroy Lindo is delightful and solid. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide support roles. The film has standard structure, with a first perfect act that is devised on the story's style and motif character, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacking depth depth and strong introduction. In the second act we run a few more issues: history of waste time during much of this segment, never really built for the third act. While the film occupies a lot of time, and a sex scene gives a solid middle draw, not a lot of everything happens. The third act is pretty much an absolute adrenaline rush that has bad wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense sequences chasing machines ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes to a great deal of scenes of inspirational action. It is the scene of the car chassis that performs this film in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Senate, whose career has been mainly designed to lead the advertisement, has a call style and a decent attitude to "Gone in 60 Seconds" that will provide audiences with two hours of noise, chills, and excitement ?? but no more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
