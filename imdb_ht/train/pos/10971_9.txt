Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and mesmerizing. I looked at astonishment as Ediths Jr. and Sr. bickered and made while reminisin of past. Existence of a disassembled castle, (which has not been left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie you will not quickly forget.
