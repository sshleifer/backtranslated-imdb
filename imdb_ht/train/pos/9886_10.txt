This is a gorgeous movie visually. The images of the Mexican desert, the old castle, the characters of their picturesque costume ... all the amount of a real work of art. <br /> <br /> The story looks a bit loose, but that's because it does not mean to be realistic. It was taken in a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, and it assumes an evocation of alienation, otherworldly atmosphere in Latin America "so far from God, and so close to the United States." The tremendous debt that Erendira be grandmothers is symbolic of the international debt burden of Latin America, although there are many layers of significance. If you can appreciate a slow-moving, rich-textured movie, this one is for you.
