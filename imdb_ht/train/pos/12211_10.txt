By Hook or By Crook is a very innovative movie from an incredibly intelligent and talented creator of Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a different style of cinemas, and it is beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti, and beautiful writing - really poetic. <br /> <br /> The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of role / inspirational pattern for dykes mouth and trannies everywhere. This film has a lot of energy, many patients' passion and heart disease in San Francisco. I can not recommend it very enough! <br /> <br /> Best movie of cow village of all time!
