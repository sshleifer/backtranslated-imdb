Well "Wayne's World" is time to go with the years since then it was difficult for snl off-shooting movies. From these cinematic films as "It's Dummy" in the last 80 minutes, "A Night at Roxbury," many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other sniper will ever make a successful transition to the screen silver. Well scared not because Tim Meadows comes in shovels. The well-written scheme holds audience interest until the very end and while remaining true to the character Leon Phelps presented in the five minute sketch, the storyline allows the character to develop. The humor (which is largely in gender junk) is cool and interesting and made me laugh harder than I have in any movie in the latest memory. It's a great time if you do not feel like taking yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen's "Delivered by Bell" fame, made an appearance in the film and looks incredible. Finally Billy Dee Williams, reviving his 45-day Colt, gave the film a touch of class. and for those who come from who is intact movie like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable, "oh, it's a lady!"
