Although I can understand the bad things someone said about this movie, I still find it to be absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and unless a criticisms you dig deep into the bad and bad in every movie, or you just simply do not touch anything, it is worth seeing. Do not enter the movie awaiting anything, just have a tissue box and an open mind. It is beautiful and the act is brilliant. I think Will Smith, although he is still playing another depressed shadow, is amazing. I believe a good actor is someone who can really show the feelings and emotions we all have in our worst / worst experience in a way that comes from you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.
