An insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly exciting, well-designed movie. I liked the way it just throws you to the subconscious the main character without coddling the viewer ... The act was head tooth - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the girl, was great as well. I was very impressed by the look of the movie, too. Usually, "independent films" have a tablet, I-shot-on-my-camcorder look, but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... work types. I'm looking forward to a work-long work at Tess Nanavati!
