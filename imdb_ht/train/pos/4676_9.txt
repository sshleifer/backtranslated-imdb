I found this thought-provoking film, with its ambiguous unambiguousness in a world of rapid-range filming where we are manipulated in the love of the "good guy" and hating the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very nice TV actor, does a great job of showing black sheep / lost children who are hoping to find his father's love and respect, as well as in his sister's widow in law with whom he apparently has a story. Judd Hirsch plays against her normal guy's good image as a father who triangles her son, and now she is left with the one she always rejected. When I saw this in the Tribeca Film Festival, I was enchanted by beautiful ways the sawdust was used to show a family tradition, as explained by the director. <br /> <br /> This is a classic fitting successor "ordinary people." I just realized, Judd Hirsch was at that, too!
