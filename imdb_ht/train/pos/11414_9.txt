A great storyline with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "coach" and Richard de Klerk play the role of "Carmine" superbly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts a good performance with Ingrid as "Hazel" plays his first lead very well. This film is a support led by Jo-Beth Williams. Correction is the first percentage.
