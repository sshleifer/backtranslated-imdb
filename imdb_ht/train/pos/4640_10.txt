It is one of the best movies I've seen in the last two years (I saw the prime minister of Tel-Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war started ...) Problems This in communication between the people, which causes war, is interesting to me for a long time, and it does not matter - boys and girls, right and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the already Bubble 3 times, and it's always surprising and interesting to me - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know, and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw it - was with my friends, who is an Arabian Christian, and it was on the Independence Day of Israel (most symbolic I could! how ironic) and ... he called the end !!! - if he touched and was not embarrassed - everyone should touch in the bubble!
