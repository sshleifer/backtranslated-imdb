This is a great movie that everyone should see. He plays as a book by Dean Koontz. Bill Paxton's performance was great at what he really looks like he believes in what he is saying and doing. <br /> I do not know why viewers have it's some kind of defending for religious killings in the movie. It is fiction. The finish is surprising but fictional. So, what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER IS NOT IF YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT THE MOVIE. Throughout the movie, the viewer is still shocked by Paxton's character, child impact, and how children handle this outrageous conduct. Then, in the end, it seems to be true. God put it on a mission to rid the world of the demons. Paxton is not clarified as other viewers suggest. Sure, it provides information that he could not otherwise know, but the movie goes further to show how God is "protected" Adam through issues of video quality and the complete lack of memory in the second FBI agent . The movie does not defend Christian murder, it is simply taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride.
