This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never conferences. The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless Johnny. It also benefits from place-by-side, design, casting, and performance design. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is more unlike "Cher" than it ever was to be a wonder. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I just see it again this Christmas Eve with my 16 year old daughter and love it as well. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves full of joy at the end.
