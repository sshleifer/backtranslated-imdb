Although the movie is the adaptation of the French play (forgetting the name - sorry), it is a wonderful portrayal of happy side of Georgian character. This movie will let you burst into laughs and will fill your heart with hot sorrow. It will show the overwhelming love of life together with eyewitnesses.
