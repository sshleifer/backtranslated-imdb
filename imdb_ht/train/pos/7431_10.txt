I was and was very entertained by the movie. It was ever favorite movie in 1976. I was so fond of Christ Christoffersons look and attitude, of course I have no movie criticism, but for the era of time, I think it was very good. I'm so much like the Combo in Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I saw the movie many times and still love two of them like Esther and Jan Norman. I am a very great fan of Christ and see him in concert when I can. What a singer talent singer song, not to mention, actor. I saw him in many movies, but still think back to a star.
