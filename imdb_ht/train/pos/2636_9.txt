The Lion King series is unlikely to succeed in the crowning of Disney animation. The original King Lion is the greatest masterpiece of celebration. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is BY FAR's best-end-to-end movie that Disney, or any other studio, made for an animated feature. It deserves a theater release. The same can be said for this movie. It has the original cast, singing by Elton John, a hilarious story, exciting action, and touching moment characters. All you have come to expect in this series. Not so much a new story, but filler and extended background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story. What impressed me the most, the care was taken in the animation. All of this often, Disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here, they are seamlessly mixing new animations and footage from the original movie. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame, and Moira Kelly reiterate their role as Simba, Rafiki, and Nala, respectively. We even get a visit returned by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheyenne Marin as the hyenas.There are many laughing at this movie. So, if you like Lion King, you need this movie. The story is just not complete without it.
