The first two-year biopsy of Betty model models are very interesting. Betty, as presented with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a beautiful, girl-next-door type, which has seen nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly was nothing wrong with li). Director Mary Harron, who made "I shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreated the American Betty by mixing black and white black and white stock with new, degraded, black and white feet. Once Betty lands in Florida and begin to work with Bunny Yeager, the color is presented. Betty's notoriety was mainly the result of his work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, with Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's photography session is fascinating and deftly executed. The early fellows in fetish materials do not describe too much condescendenly and we find a sense that as such were part of a tight "community". Betty has never been too much in a problem with his notoriety, although we get the impression that his reputation prevents it from taking legitimacy in the right world to act. Because the third act of films is usually non-existent, we remain with the impression that we have looked at a long documentary documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Aside from it, it's a movie well worth catching and representing yet another fine pen in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.
