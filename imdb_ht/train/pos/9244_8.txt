If you only read a summary of the plot, this movie would sound like quite a typical one in the 1930s. The story would look quite fine, the matter of the maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film are in direct, ground performance at the cast. I rarely saw Jean Harlow exhibits as a series of feelings, rich nuances and subtle floats on her face. If you look at the faces during the wedding ceremony at the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters. The raw emotions are so sincere to describe, so true. The final sequel is almost unbearable: when Clark Gable resembles happiness and surprise to his son, lifts him upward and proudly says, "My kid!", I could not help remember that clean Mr. Gable's son was born to him posthumously. This is one of the finest examples of the depression of the era.
