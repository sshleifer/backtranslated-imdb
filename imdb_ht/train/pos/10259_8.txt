A lot of people unjustly sh! T on this series but several of the guinea pigs videos are just fun. The Devil's experience in particular has some really fantastic work - not just the sad eye eyeball scene, but also a very realistic skincare on the foot and a crushed hand and a sledgehammer are very realistic - especially for old and low-budget videos. <br /> Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know: This movie is an "extreme" torture film / fake manure surface in Japan in the mid 80s. It is drawn as it is simple: A young girl was born by a few men and forced them to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where it broke. This implies brutish violence - all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking looking at hot oil in the girl's arms to the prisoner and wearing maggots in the wound that gets After the <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of a compulsive slap session where three men take also tapping the hell from the girl as herself falls on and a second sequence where three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing him to the ground. These two scenes obviously scene and detect from realism in the rest of the proceedings. The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is very compelling in being in pain and taking a good amount of abuse and roughness on camera. His reaction as he has headphones attached to his head and loud noise played for hours at the end of refrigeration. Some of the other abuses that he has taken are fed to a net from a single tree once it receives a rest. Also there is a disturbing scene where the captors giggling in the bowel and another disagustingly suzen scene where it is sharpened in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until it picks. You did not see this series I hope I helped you decide if you do not want to give this episode a shot. 8.5 / 10 for the Devil's Experience.
