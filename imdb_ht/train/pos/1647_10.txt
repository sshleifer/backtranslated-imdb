Excellent. Gravity presentation with real pioneering henna hills on the West Plains and a focus on the role and place of the woman. A movie is moving, lovingly done, and based on real people and real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never make any money. Definitely not romanticized, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life.
