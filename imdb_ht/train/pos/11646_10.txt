This movie, though it's about one of the favorite subjects of Mexican producer producers: the extreme life of our city, has a funny way to put it on the screen. Four of the most important Mexican directors, in recent times, the history of our city's approach is framed by various literary as it can be the farce or satire, which gives us a movie and a brief exposing subject to our country but tells in a very different way that gives a freshness to her tone. <br /> With little known actors, but interpreting the excellent paperwork, each one of the directors reflected in the stories the ability we have identified anywhere in the world, which ability to laugh pain and make celebrations in sadness. Maybe many of our country's film is not happy, but I think that other countries could get attracted and shared surrealism in the Mexican.
