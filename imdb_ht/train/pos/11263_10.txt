This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was very much like this. There are many "facts" in stories that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl shows them very well, in an unforgettable way. Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students, but the history of students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way of discovering some of the most well-known illustrations in the history of the world and striving to impress them on the student's brain read them. Using live actors that make "skits" is also very fun. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the story they learned as a child turned upside down.
