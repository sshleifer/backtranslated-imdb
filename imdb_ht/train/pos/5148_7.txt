I do not know what it is with this movie. But movies about history or religion are still criticized by their accuracy. Of course it's not 100% accurate. It's hard to make 100% accurate film nowadays when the same "experts" agree with each other. That is why I prefer to love a movie by what she tries to say that chooses on all the drawers. So I start saying that I liked this mini set. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood goes away too quickly. The series should have a history of three parts, since it was the first part. But if they did not have more money to shoot more stories I criticized ... <br /> There is only one real issue I have with this movie and is the fact that he says in a book book story. Especially the second part is just a sum of events that happened. I prefer to see Hitler more humane (more scenes where he doubts himself). Noah Taylor did so more in the movie 'Max' that seems to work better I think. But I'm glad this was done and owned it on DVD. Just to recall all that happened and see Carlyle giving her best. 7.5 / 10
