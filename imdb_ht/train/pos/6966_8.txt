Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were worrying, as he felt the criteria were trying to create a science fiction version of the OC, but this fear has rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the steps are shown in terms and situations that I very rarely see TV tackling. BSG has been dealing with terms such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but were mostly subtext, the viewer must gaze on or ignore if they so choose. Here's the other hand these topics is the focus of the show and I personally found myself conveying these tasks as the Ghost of the Shell and the womb as point reference while watching and being surprised at how the terms were discuss. I think if you're a fan of me just mentioned or other films / TV shows, which deal with the subjects I referenced, I think you'll get at least something here. starting point out how to explain how our situation in BSG came about I believe they are busy in a very interesting way, I especially like to explain where Cylon's belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica was just The advanced and contemporary technology is thrown into making it appear in the future but not completely foreign to our viewers. The real real weak points I have noticed were the relationship between Greystone parents and the actress who play 'Lacy Rand'. While I love Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, along the scenes they seem to miss chemistry, at this point it might simply be down to develop their characters, but this is something I think needs to work. I also found Magda Apanowicz to be compelling in her role. This could again be down to experiment with the time needed to develop, but throughout the acting act she appears forced and not completely confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot I very much look forward to seeing where 'Caprica' goes to the future and hopefully it will touch the magnitude that BSG once did.
