Seeing how the average vote was very low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "just OK", I did not have much expectations when renting this movie. <br /> But contrary to the above, I loved it very much. This is a good movie. It did not need to grow on me, I enjoyed it in the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character, I think a bit different from his usual character in his movies. <br /> There is not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some hilarious scenes, and in general this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
