This is not as violent as I was expecting that the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective. <br /> There are a lot of twists and turns and back knives and double crosses all the way to film making it difficult to know which side a particular character is over. The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and provides an interesting view of the operation of the triad gang it follows. /> <br /> The violence when it comes is brutal, there is no weapon or martial arts scene with special effects, this is credible in your face violence and for all the dialogue you never allow to forget that the triad is an organization violent criminal. <br /> <br /> The finish is surprising but consistent and credible.
