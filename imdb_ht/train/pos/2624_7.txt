In this movie we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the movie when they are not shown - that's a lot! This movie goes back before Simba and (presumably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /> It's true a first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising movie (or end if you want to call it). A pack of surprises and hello wait for you! While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a movie in the movie (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have a discussion on which point in "The Lion King" will start watching, as Timon wants to go to The party when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the start. They have a very fair compromise in watching the movie in their own stories, which is what awaits ... It begins with Timon's first home ... For anyone who has a good sense of humor who liked the movie first just about any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
