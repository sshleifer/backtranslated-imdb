So what is the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or someone involved? Why would the best show I've seen in years being canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this show last autumn, and immediately loved it and looked it every week. Then he went, and I tried to Tivo, but he was not disclosed. So I forgot about it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with all others - and the rest of the junk on TV today, it was worthwhile to see something as well rounded and developed like this. I look at Boston Legal for my unique-comedic range, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass rack. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for her "realism", and I like / hates the show, but she can not be far from real to me. WAY third drama. All that can go wrong, do. But for once, there's a really real drama. Real people, real problems. Sure, some extreme such an old gangster turns good, girls run out of the crowd, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) really are out there, and I relate to each and every one of them. I can not seem to get enough. I just hope ABC will find themselves out of the weight-counting weight and continue to show this. Get some respect for having a good drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of ever. If someone just leaves it.
