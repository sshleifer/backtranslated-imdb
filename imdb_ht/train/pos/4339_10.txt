This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel touched by the theme of the movie intended to convey. A phrase that keeps coming to my head is that "story repeats itself". Life is what it shows in the movie: when the young people seem to not understand their parents, their own spouse; people have the excuse to share the cheapest time with their kids until too late; people still have hard work to support the whole family, but they are just responsible for neglecting subtle sentiments to their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; People can always forgive if their hearts are filled with love for their dear ones; There is nothing more important than the unrelated relationships of this world, and one is never too late to talk about how to feel at the bottom of their hearts so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves, so that when life at the end of a day, people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their word and have always hope-a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They understood the principal's intention perfectly. The film's charm lies in me, the effect brings a skillful and superb fusion of cheers and tears in the audience.
