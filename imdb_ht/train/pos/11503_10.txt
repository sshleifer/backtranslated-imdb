Kolchak is absolute entertainment. Big stories with a big cast and nothing else to squeeze it down. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the strongest support that most leading actors can only dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and fiberglass to individual episodes - Erik Estrada of the Terror Heritage, Phil Silvers of Terror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas of the Zombie. It's easy to see how a little bit happened Kolchak drove Chris Carter to create X files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Rit - RIP.
