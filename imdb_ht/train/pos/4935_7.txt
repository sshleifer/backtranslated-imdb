In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the Blackie Smalltime Criminal (Walter Jack Palance). He chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by blackie and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, the relatives of Lt. Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the United States Public Health Services found that the deceased had pneumonia caused by rats and he needed to have had any kind of contact with the man forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. City Mayor agrees to Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) captain to help Dr Clint get the infected killer and the epidemic and inoculation. <br /> <br /> The "Panic in the Streets" discloses a simple story, but it is always effective with a huge villain. The pledged plot has not been dating after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a jerk of his first debut, and the camera work while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the Streets")
