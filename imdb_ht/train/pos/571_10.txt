In watching how the brothers communicate and feed each other in the movie all make me personally happy to live in rural areas as they did in the movie. I watched this movie countless times and have the right book beside my Bible. After looking at the movie I agree that this is one of the few movies that make a book fair. I recommend anyone who is lucky to go to Montana Fish or be out there for doing this. It's amazing. I can not think of anyone else who might play the role better than Brad Pitt. Make yourself justice and look at one of the best movies in the modern movie era. Recommended Structure And as a fishing tour guide in both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly fish out of the movie scene because although it looks great on the movie you have no idea how many practices and fishing skills like what actually takes. Thanks for listening Watch this movie please if you would like a long movie sad.
