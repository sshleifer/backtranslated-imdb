It's a pleasure to see these creatures on TV again. Show this is poetic, artistic and good fun. The characters relate well to the writing is not bad (I think it will improve as they get their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Girls stole the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable as is Olive. Two aunts are a pleasure. I sincerely hope to write them in the bigger parts as they are magic. <br /> Well, that's all the news that fit the print. Go make yourself a great popcorn bowl and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
