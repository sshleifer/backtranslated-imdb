I like this movie. It is great movie that combines English and Indian culture with feminist-quality issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that have already been reserved for men. It shows the struggles of an Indian people who want to break out of his cultural barriers and women want to break out the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural struggles are more important than other issues. <br /> In contrast to the other comment, I do not think that this movie is something like dancing dancing or any other flick chick. This move does not like many people, men and women, young and old alike.
