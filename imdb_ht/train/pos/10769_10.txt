I love Monte Carlo and well enjoy this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought his character (Julian Peters) was very personal, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the girls were inscribed with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was good with the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a garden day as the good living. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a virtuous virtuous wife ignored. Delicate ensemble cast. Many talent, smart script, many go over and beautiful places. Just a nice pick me for a sad day. Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizons.
