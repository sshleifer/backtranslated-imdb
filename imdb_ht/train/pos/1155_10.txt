It's very funny. He has a great cast that gives great performance. Especially Sally Fields and Kevin Kline. It's a scenario well written by Andrew Bergman (Bees In Vegas). I do not like soap opera, even though I never looked at them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and on the wall, that it defeats the hell from any stupid soap that they have on TV daylight. In my opinion, it's the best movie in 1991.
