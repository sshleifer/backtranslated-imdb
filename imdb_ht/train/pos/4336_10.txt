The thing about my folks is a wonderful movie about relationships - first and foremost to an adult son and his father, but also his son and his wife, his sister and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, intense and thought-provoking. He led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my dad now dead to my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been best cast. I hope both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will recognize the award-winning cameras next year for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his script.
