I did not even want to watch this movie after reading the Maltin's review and 1 1/2 rating stars. I watched her anyway on the advice of my son and found it better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars from a star system 4. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from the high school year was the movie, so maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there are some pretensions in the movie and it is strange to some extent, but that was the 70s so what you expect. I can see why people would not like the movie; However, I can not understand who says it is boring. The movie is anything but boring. You will either hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you're probably dead brain.
