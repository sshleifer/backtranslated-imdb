Woy. This film really really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscles. Surely an amazing man, if you watch it in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a crazy / bloodthirsty, and then finally to Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks like the beautiful in scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss has no hack either! Jump to Career from Matrix and Momento as a darker character, in a 1950's Conservative Heart Housing! The rare days to see actors can not be kind-casted. <br /> Now on the storyline (No Spoilers, Do not Worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Author of Zombie and Second World War Guide) happy and happy! Finally a well done doom of zombies and comedy. <br /> If you love zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are just bored, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!
