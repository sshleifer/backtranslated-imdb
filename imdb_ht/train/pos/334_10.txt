It is very simple to qualify this movie: "A MASTERPIECE PURE". This opinion is formulated for the following purposes: performance of actors, they seem to be citizens of this era, 1100 B.C. They are personalized perfectly to the characters. A second reason is that the poem expressed by Homer in poems is well given in the production. Among others, the choral narrative is given to a particular atmosphere that contributes to the artistic production. Third purpose: the reconstruction of the decor is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean region, where the action of the poem occurred. And most of all, the emotion is on the appointment. I repeat my appreciation: "A PEOPLE MASTERPIECE".
