This is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned wireless adventure. I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of Indians was unacceptable. But moving this is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, act, direction, music, and photography, and it's wonderful about all of these factors. Grant, Fairbanks, and McLaglen are electrically joined, and Jaffe is superb. This is the ultimate buddy movie.
