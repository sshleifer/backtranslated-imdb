Great actor, an actor candidate Oscar, stunning scenery, good storyline stories and more laugh than you can fit into my new suit (and great ones). This movie was brilliant. He was very well-acting in the most serious scenes and the funny moments were. . well, divide. I've never heard a cinema street audience, and tears streaming down my jaw while the ladies' stoned at the shop scene. Well done the British movie industry with Craig Ferguson with magic ingredients made sure this is one of my favorite films of the year, if not ever.
