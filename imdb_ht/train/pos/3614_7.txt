Girlfight is like your grandmother's cook: even your old recipes have tried a million times before, yet somehow transform into something fresh and new. Try and explain the story to those who have not seen it before: a young woman from the wrong side of the tracks try to improve her situation by taking boxing also to deal with a bitter father, and to attract her growing a male rival. Look at them rolling their eyes in the string of the glitches, and they're right: it * is * clich√©d. But I was hypnotized by how this film works, due to many superb acting and dialogue, and sensitive sensations that make it 'new'. I avoid this in the movie because it looks like complete crap but does not make the same mistake I did. Defined is worth a look.
