If you love cartoon adult cartoons, such as South Park, then this is almost a similar format on the little adventures of three young girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina have blasted sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on teachers at school. There is the principal, Mr. Bip, nervous math teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Lenina Henry Gina Yashere, Chrissie Watts EastEnders, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack Pony at Doon Mackichan, Mark Ring Perry and Nina Conti Blunder. I did not know this was from Canada, but it is very good. Really good!
