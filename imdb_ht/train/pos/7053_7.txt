Do not mistake "War Inc" for a sharply saturated satire or a brainy comedy full of jokes inside for news enthusiasts. It is not .. This is a vicious old-fashioned comedy, with torsion drawn ridiculous co-identity, stock characters (giving some depth of fun performance by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a simple approach to the political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political filmmakers' things are almost all of the land already know they are true. Yeah, we understand that the corporations profit from the corrupt war, the inept pig, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept biphons, and American imperialism never looked krasser and more out of touch than it now - but There is no of which is the point. <br /> Here, everyone who rocks is the environment that they are lamps - sometimes in genius - like the series for a funny stuffing, as Jan Cusack's character (the hit-and-heart hit) trying to change life her with the help of her do-good journalist (Tomei) and young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call her wedding (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with a very entertaining cartoonishly quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to be wasting his youngest party as a boss without CIA. <br /> <br /> That's all, and it works. It's simple, but if you can not see reality and you think the war will be well and everyone involved with it will do a good job and no corruption with people in the Middle East want our Western culture supervising theirs, then you can not get it as funny. <br /> For the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political corner.
