I love this show as it shares packed with love, adventure and intrigue. Well some times love! It is so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It is also very good for Dick Van Dyke in a television role as I only saw her in Mary Poppins. The mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very captured by the audience. This is a show you have to watch!
