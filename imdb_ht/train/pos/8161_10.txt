When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially those who do not like fascinating scenes as the Dentist has many stage scenes. That's why it has its R18 rating. It's about a Beverly Mount dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on her and the poolman. It is best to go to your dentist "before" you look at this. And if you do not like going to the dentist already, then it's best not to look this as you can put away for life. The dentist has the best blood vengeance that I have ever seen. Who ever saw a movie with a dentist (Spoiler) pulling all his wife knocking teeth and cutting out her tongue with no anesthesia? Generally flick crap, but not for everyone.
