I have zero interest rates in Ghetto culture, I'm white and love classic rock, however, that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's very nice an end to this is Spinal Tape in the sense that it is the same film, just about rap rather than rock. But it's hilarious. There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat. The characters are all very funny and credible. I look just because he made me laugh at 3 am, with any movie that can make that mandate at least a screening. One of the reasons why this movie was so funny was that it made fun of rap from a different one. Rap today is concerned with the evil things and get by and noise studio with talent. This movie comes from a time where rappers deserve more credit. In general, it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the most obvious terms of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
