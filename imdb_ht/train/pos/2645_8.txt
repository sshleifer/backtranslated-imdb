No movies have taken my attention as this one has. You see, I wanted to watch this movie again for more than twenty-five years. One and only time I saw it was like a teenager-ager who could be the year he was released, 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember in the movie is that it touches these great thrills So deeply so deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again. This movie integrates into the human element of father / child searching and searching is sure to touch every human soul who is watching it. Why this film is not carried out by storage and often shows as many other movies in the least, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: getting copies of movie and after watching it again was happy to see which memories are being held true. Rating reflects movie content. Would like to watch this movie on DVD as seen in 1977 on this tape using VHS taken from the overall quality.
