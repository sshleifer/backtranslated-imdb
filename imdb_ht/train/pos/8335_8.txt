While the brilliant chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is just enough to see this film, cast in support (including Matthieu, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious threesome of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is a plus more . Matthau shines as Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's fianc√©e clinic, and Shalub's line on Einstein's Gonadin is, as noted, one of the films shown. Robbins's speech delivered in his first appearance to the public is absolute poetry. Kudos writers for touching this brush with wit and delicacy. I also thought Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. This might be considered something of a chick movie, but I think everyone will get a kick out of it. Eight very solid points.
