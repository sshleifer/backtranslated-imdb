I saw this movie at a time when I was timidly toying with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting to live on my own. Perhaps that's the reason I took it seriously. I was totally convinced of the psychological degradation of the poor character inside a Paris homepage, dust, scalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I give all credits to Polanski's artistry in his direction, play it, his inevitable script, but I'm tired during the horrific final scene and was to be revived by cognac at the office of the theater manager. Luckily, my life on my own did not turn out as disasters like this (so far) but I always kept a strong respect for an artist that can make these illusions and totally immerse herself into reality The (fake) it tries to convey. Simply put, the man is a genius in the first order and a credit in the human race. This movie is the sum of many, many cases of great casting and casting. As some performances made in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski made their own debris in English and French, I recommend recognition , if you happen to be bilingual, change the audio from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of the Polanski so-called "trilogy apartment building" which also includes "Repulsion" and "Baby Rosemary". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still has not made it to a decent DVD transfer to Region 1. Needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.
