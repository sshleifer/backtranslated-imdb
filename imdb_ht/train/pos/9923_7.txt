I read several revisions mixed with several of them outright trashed the movie. I originally became interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after people on fire had such a profound impact on me. Before I start my review, let's first say that ... it's wonderful to see that this movie could be said in a boring and ordinary way, but the writers and Scott have chosen a different approach. Draw: <br /> <br /> Simply stated, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies give 'tried and true' in the cemetery that they know will connect with people, often ensuring acceptance of audiences in the movie and creating a greater probability of profit. This plot was one of the more exciting I've seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently looked at 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I'm going to say that these movies are excellent, and I enjoyed them both very much, both in the cemeteries of these The boring cinema and they were told exactly how you would expect to be said. They do not take any chance anyway, and they are very predictable after you've watched a fair amount of American movie. The Domino scheme is both interesting and said in a way that keeps you thinking, "oh the people, they're aiming now". And I feel missing in a lot of recent films. She has a lot of depth, in my opinion, and she gives you lots of questions while watching her. In general, this is what has caught me so interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Character: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful thing to show a beautiful woman, who was nothing but the inside and wanted to see her as she was. It was obvious that he wanted to prove himself and he also meant that he had to fulfill that. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very credible, using it in Spanish in proper situations, its reaction to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy problem in the team ... they all sound true to me, , which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was less interesting in me, but it always remains true to me. It seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. I hope that is what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because what I got out of it. He did a great job of showing Ed in an average type of Joe in the way that made her mistake, but she still tries to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe they have been given much 'heart' in the story. They were not just people out of money getting money to buy a Bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and sought to find others to accomplish this goal. You could embed with them because, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who were less likely to enter this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The Mobsters: The story was made to disaster in a way that only the mob could. And I really liked this part. They also paddled the story with little subtleties that made the draw more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 guys: <br /> <br /> They are given the funny relief of an otherwise serious movie. From Walken's left statement the endless references of the 90210-men were Beens. Their participation in the film only made it much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes ... the movie. This is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was engineering, the use of the camera to translate the attitude to the current situation was very effective in my opinion. I consider it a method that has been well achieved, but it can still be used upgrades, just like anything else. I both applauded and commended Scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography about taking some real chance with this movie. Not only did they go far and above and its presentation, they went that much further. The use of color, both very light and very black gives the 'look' of the movie with a disaster look and grungy that well-painted the life of the crowd, bounty hunters and less likely in a way that their lives are not ' t as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there have been many cameras if any of them. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and did not just do it for heck of it. I realized that most people who watched this film did not wait for it and caused many of them to be turned off in this movie but I think it was great that Scott had taken this approach. Hollywood films have grown predictable and bold. Most will shoot in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad Scott was trying to do something different. <br /> <br /> Granted, this film is not for everyone, but to say it is garbage and nothing to offer is completely missing the point. I really enjoy this movie and I'm glad I spent the money for it. I would recommend this to all, but I'm sure it will only hit a few ropes. I must agree with a poster earlier when saying that many of those who refuse to view the 'sphere of MTV' will not appreciate this movie, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. With that in mind, I think it's a lot to do.
