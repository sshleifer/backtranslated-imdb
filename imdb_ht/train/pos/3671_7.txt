"North Hollywood" is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper expenses in a civilized city like Toronto, in that case, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw a lot of invaders from California that this film seems to be the right way to deal with their personality reaching trying to capitalize on the savings that Canada presents. Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", the success novel is written by a Canadian author back to "Flight Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original film. A great egotist te-te, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, offers the lead part, which becomes a disaster. The film seems to say that too many Cooks had spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case with the ultimate product, which is saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who was around to make a documentary in the movie shot in Toronto, the movie part was transformed into a movie itself. The filming process is hilarious, and act, in general, is a good thing.
