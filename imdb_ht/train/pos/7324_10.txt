My favorite movie movie. From the track follow track first of the final story's twist, this is the chapel's head. <br /> <br /> Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers killing his older sister. All-Hallows-Eve 1978, Michael escapes from Grove Smith's sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael came home to murder again. <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael feet and killing babysitters. There are no bells or whistles, just the basics. It's almost over-the-car's atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror movie, the events have long been telegraphed in advance, but still seem to happen at random, never allow the audience to luck to the second guess film. <br /> <br /> The dark lighting, fixed-time vaccinations, and (most importantly) modest music modestly create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in the movie. There is a body count, but compared to killing in slashers afterwards it's fairly small. That and most of the killers are almost bloody. The heart is not in death, but it does not know. <br /> <br /> The act is good roundelay. PJ Soles has given many of the limited films (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turned into a decent performance and then had the young (at the moment) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. His performance first seems shy and un-assured, but you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is himself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what he is facing. And of course there is definitely to dispose Donald Pleasence as determined (maybe a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasant. <br /> If the film has a defective defect, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film many years ago almost untold clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators came along and stolen (usually seriously) the best movie bits until almost everything about it became accustomed. Combining with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the raw films may be diluted. To really appreciate it to this day and age, it must be viewed as once, as something unique. <br /> Never the less, I have no reservations and highly recommended this movie anyone looking for a good, awesome time. Regular higher. <br /> <br /> 10/10
