What can I say about the first movie ever? <br /> You can not rate this, because it does not matter fun. But if you have it, you should give it a 10. It's stunning to see images moving from the year to 1895. This was one of the most important movies in history. I wonder how he should be the one who has seen the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
