This is one of the movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up in the morning. It will give you warm, feel soft and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Sure, we find the typical stereotypes of characters and stories, but it does the trick: entertain. /> <br /> When you come from Sweden and living in the US for sometime, it's funny how we react. "The deceitful husband will kill him", "He (Gabriella) is going to die and then will have a major-over-life renovation". We know how these things work, everything comes together in the end. And he did. The characters were a bit bit, they were so elaborate that you did not really think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination. The nearest would probably Siv, it makes you ask yourself if it really was in love with Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> But the movie is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable. Michael Nyqvist is truly genius, and his insane look unique and Frida Hallberg is good and affordable. Maybe a little too nice. <br /> But most of all this movie makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you are identified. I do not know about you guys, but that does not happen that often.
