"California" is one of my ever-present movies, and it's easy to be labeled as one of the best psychological stairs in the 90's. The film has a very stylish surface in it, but behind which is a lot of disturbing and honest deficits of homicidal and terrifyng violence they are hurting on others. One of the most influential films is his performance, Brad Pitt is dubious as a trash-trailer trash named Early. Pitt potrays his scary character almost perfectly. Juliette Lewis is also as good as her na√Øve girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. California has a very simple scheme of it, which goes gradually and slowly forward for an hour, but it suddenly dives into a spree overrun in assassinations, as Pitt unleashes its psychotic personality. There are plenty of shocking scenes, and it's all in a great powerhouse that will haunt you for days. "California" is a movie that should really look for it's intense look at how monstrous someone can be, and not just for it violence and gore.
