I saw this film about a year ago, and found it to be completely laugh-out-loud funny. A real winner, in my mind. It was outlined in a stupid comedy, but indeed there was a real plot as well. Many such comedy strikes, elf, in fact. It had a serious moment, sandwich between hilarity. When Horse Stiller's Black Shot, an ordinary moderate moment, you find yourself laughing in his bumbling antique. You can actually get the common ground, as I'm sure many people did something they would not want a friend to find out about, because your friendship should end. <br /> When I found out how many people this movie, I was completely dumbfounded. That absolutely awful movie like Napoleon Dynamite was higher ratings than it made me ask about the sanity of people on IMDb. Take my advice and lease it. If you do not get yourself laugh at least once, I'll compensate you for the rental fee. = D
