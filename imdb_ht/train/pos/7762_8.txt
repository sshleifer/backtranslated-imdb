In his autobiography, Laureen Bacall revealed that Bogie had told her that she should not make these films dudes like this one or something like that. At that moment, Douglas Circk has labeled "weepies for women", actually, It was restored in favor of at least in Europe, after it was stopped direct. But when he filmed "writing on the wind," Circus had only three cinemas done: "Angel food", "A time love with a time to die ", his chief, IMHO, and finally" Imitation of Life "(1960) .Then was silence. Actually Bacall and Hudson characters are not interested Sirk.They are too straight, too virtuous. Darya Malone - who had some kind of replacement for his former German star Zarah Leander - and his brother Robert Stack gave the main interest in the plot. A draw built continuously, most of the movie being a long flashback. Instability The brother and sister, from a family of wealthy master meters to Texan, is brought to the fore by garish clothes, and careless cars that go to top speeds in a landscape derricks. The Malone Metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning: Costume with chignon, toys and a little denrick: it's ready for life, the rebellion is tamed. Now, alone, because he lost Hudson (but anyway, he was not in love with it) .This is a little archaic, but melodrama is through reactionary excellence; Three years later, in "Imitation of Life," Sara-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed because she does not know her place.
