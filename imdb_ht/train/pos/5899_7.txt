Cute idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherited a tiny little kid in Lampidorra. That country, which was not even in North America, made the 49th state ... (Of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to her country has inherited, and we follow it along as it tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its neighbors. At one point he sings a song that he claims is from his Navajo people, and he gets ever-more sillier in hand .... although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared . There are other songs scattered around-out as the newly welcomed princesses welcome the princesses. Filmed in a British glorious version of Technicolor, or some such equities, on the only great name here is Dirk Bogarde as British topic Tony Craig, Cheese trader. Bogarde made a great splash in the UK movie industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" hold bumps in one another, and their adventures become tighter as Lampidorra's financial problems are getting worse ... Little fun farce ... on the lines of Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and our small project director, and stay married for 50 years! Guest was best known for writing and directing its sci-fi arrow, in both the UK and the US.
