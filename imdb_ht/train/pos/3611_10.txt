I saw this movie after I saw Blue Crush and other of Michelle's movies, I thought she had a weak future in this business. It was very bad after watching her performance at "Girlfight" I was amazed by the way In it captures the emotion of one a fighter, but also a warrior.In this movie as he meets his father on the treatment of his and his brother, the way he turns anger when you get hit .Her character learns the curve of the film in it cant always put a wall and hide in love, or just because it has power to shame win.I believe that this role was perfectly fit for Michelle even though he had no previous experience The director saw the talent, I criticized myself to see the talent in it.
