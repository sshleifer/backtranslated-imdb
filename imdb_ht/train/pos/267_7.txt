It all starts with a series of flights of lost objects related to a hostel for students on Hickory Road, London. Regarding her sister, who the housekeeper, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look into the problem. He agrees, but soon the nails get higher when a girl, who admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the flights, was murdered. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without such intellect-numbingly complicated as "A, De, Put My Shoes". Murder, robbery and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the final twist that ties everything together reveals only in the past 2 minutes! The exciting characters, particularly the Colin McNabb student and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Japp inspectors have her comic moments (perhaps the closest to this series comes in "Toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon become the most part integral to the story than usual.
