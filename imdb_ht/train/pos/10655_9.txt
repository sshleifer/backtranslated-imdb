It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to get advantage of it and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is blocked under a dock and neither his wife nor the boy is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) took the car and searched for help. Short film John Sturges (69 minutes) is powerful because unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who can help, but there is a cost he has to pay for that. There is a double movie question posed. How far would you go to help the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's behavior towards the stranger - does he really love her husband? Like a good short story short this movie let the viewer for himself and his questions can only answer himself.
