The "Last Wave" is one of those movies that depends very much on yourself. The title refers to the Aboriginal Doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wets everything. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer who has been hired to defend some Aborigines who have been accused of murder. Around that time, there was very heavy rainfall in Australia. While defending Aborigines, David learns the latest wave theory, and begins to wonder whether he is mythology. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the movie is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind. Peter Weir created a difficult but thought-provoking movie. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (who you can see in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-proof fence") provides an exciting support role as one of the defendants. <br /> If you find a chance, see the "make" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the underground film, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
