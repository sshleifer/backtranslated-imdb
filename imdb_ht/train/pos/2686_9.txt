La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spain movie. All that in this film has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different from the normal movie that someone has access to. This film is good but it will be good for those who want to look for the meaning of everything in the movie's history. I must advise that this is not a sample movie. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
