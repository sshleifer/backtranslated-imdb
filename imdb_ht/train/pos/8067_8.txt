Today if someone mentioned the name McLaglen Victor the answer most likely will be "Who?" or maybe "why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actress in this film, which is about a poor, desperate man who wants to sell out his best friend for "carfare" in the United States. It is an interesting movie that shows how to even the most meaningful shnooks will go just for a few bucks. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all other characters are either directly or indirectly fought for the political independence of Ireland, Mr. McLaglen's character is concerned about receiving money and getting drunk. The film makes one wonder if the political activist is worth the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what the fuss is all about. The morality of this movie is: look out for the friend, he can sell you out for a cents.
