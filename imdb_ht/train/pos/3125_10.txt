The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After a series of typing two, we get the final installment. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> The ultimatum of Bourne has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coattails of people who know everything. He ran for too long. This time it ends. The Ultimatum Bourne has a great draw, writes awesome, fantastic directions, suspense, and some of the best action in the summer. Matt Damon will probably deliver his best performance to date. He has conviction and swallows the desire of the troubled killer. There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspensions. The reactions to certain events will have you either laugh (in a great way) or be cheering on. (or both) I heard a lot of clever laugh in the theater and many of the applause. The audience liked it. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all of a nicely gift-wrapped package. All the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion I'm the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how stairwell summer screens should be done. I like trilogy in Bourne.
