"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialogue and acting are great. I love the characters and ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, presented in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the night) and it is not possible to get to everywhere in one night, either (especially if you is a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happened, the film never gets boring. The finish is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like your love story you should watch this movie! I'm a bit uncertain about the end that will be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.
