She calls Oscar and lets her know what happened. Fellix turns into the Oscar during his weekly poker week with friends Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray (David Sheiner) Murray (Larry Haines) and Rapid (Larry Haines) .After some hysterical divisions he agreed to Felix to stay with Oscar. The rest of the movie center on how these two are as completely different characters. As well as looking at whether Oscar can stand Felix's really unusual and unique habit and cleanliness and if Felix can stand Oscar being such a slave and putting his attitude back into everything. Really a movie about two full opposite living together with joys, o, lows and the necessity of the gift that is friendship.
