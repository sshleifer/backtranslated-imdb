Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adult wife of a great businessman who inherited $ 1million life insurance when her husband dies in a plane crash while on a business trip ?? Initially she was suspected of being responsible as her husband had recently been changed and she has an insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on it just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to cash in its inheritance but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch who is now known as Baumer is trying to protect her from a lover of her husband Lara Florakis who, along with his Sharif Sharif, tries to kill them both for part of the money he has deemed to have the right . And this is where our masked soldier starts / kills him brutally. Lynch as usual with our hero, the first suspect by the Greek Police and was warned by leaving Athens by Police Inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli a familiar figure in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then assisted by Cl√©ber Dupont's gorgeous (Anita Strindberg) a local journalist who helps her investigate the killings.To say any more can ruin the movie for anyone who has not seen it, so enough says there is enough red herring and most of them are convincing to keep mystery / fan fond of joy in this gigantic driving history of Giallo.The no DVD drugs have a superb transfer with both English and Italian bands. It also has a pretty catchy note just for good measure by Bruno Nicolai who will stay in your head for a while ... all in all a first Giallo rate.
