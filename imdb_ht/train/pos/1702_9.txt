If you have your dream problem you can give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize this movie has not done to please everyone, <br /> <br /> just people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people the movie is great! He plays on old science fiction movies and shows radio time away, most of the B-rated ones witch heads. Along the lines of Spaceballs and Aircraft 2, you may need to stretch your imagination slightly to get the jokes, but it is well worth it.
