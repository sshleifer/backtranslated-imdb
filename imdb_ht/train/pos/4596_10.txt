This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favorite. After disappointing US made the 'protection' led by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and put him bang slap in Hong Kong. This is also probably the most violent movie jackies, and the audience cringing at the breaking dice exhibits. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew really put max effort into the battle design. The bones are broken and bloody in the process of making this movie as you will see in the credits. The script is a simple flicker and stealing artifacts, nothing special, after all he writes around action. I must say that the English version has some dodgy curtains, but it should not put you off too much. <br /> So get the round boy, crack open beers and enjoy. By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the Cascade crew. Why? I'll let you get out for yourself !!
