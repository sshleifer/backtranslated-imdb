Well, I know this project does'nt India in a good light. But the overall theme of the film is not India, it's Shakti. The power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you up in the heat. Then things go terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and his father in law - the power of dysfunctional relations - and life changed by it is the strength of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be just a cumulative comparison with the credible hopelessness of Karisma Kapoor. It's easy to get caught up in love, violence and redemption of life in this movie, and find yourself awakening a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. The music interludes are strong, credible and well-done.
