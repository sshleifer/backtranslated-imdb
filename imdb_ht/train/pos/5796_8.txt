Moonwalker is a music music staring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will rate each segment individually. Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The music video is a concert by Michael Jackson to sing the "Man of the Mirror", the music video also featuring historical figure shows such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the movie I loved the song and also loved the montage of the historical figure. I also love the message of the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's starting from Jackson's five in her solo career. The assembly I thought was well done, I loved the animations put in it and I loved the choices of songs like "I want you back, beat it, thriller, you can feel it and how you make me feel . " The only thing I wish they could do a little better in one of the songs in the assembly is "We are the World". The reason why all you see is rainfall and of these drops are Michael Jackson's images and the choir of celebrities, but it's a little hard to see the chorus. Other than this segment is always good. I'm giving it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the Bad Song. You'll probably think of Michael Jackson's video of bad, Well yes with name. This segment is the music video but it is redone by Kids. The segment was beautiful but it was not as good as the other segments. I'm giving it a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short movie movie film that takes place after the kid's version of the bad call "Speed ​​Demon". The short is over Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans, he pressed and disguised himself as a rabbit and riding a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The claymation in the hunting sequence was great, but some parts of the movie Claymation characters look a little fake when interacting with real people. Also at the end of the clip from where Michael Jackson's costume rabbit comes to life and he's dancing with it. I love the dance but that was like out of nowhere. I'm giving it a 8/10 <br /> <br /> The segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Music Video "Let me alone." The music video is about the media poking the noses of personal life Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson feel they will not let him alone no matter how much he proved innocent. The music video really speaks out (but keep in mind this happened before the molestation of this kid just all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) But I did not feel this Video would be in this movie because it's a movie movie and I do not think the kid will understand what he sings about. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the movie all called "Smooth Criminal." Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his power to a star star as a crime crime figure to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from a malicious mobster called Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). Segment I thought really carried out the film especially when he danced and sang the "Smooth Criminal" song with a bunch of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the segment is why the kids hang out with a grown man never explain why. Also Joe Pesci characters talk about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why you would talk about drugs in a movie child. Other wise men were good. My rating for this segment is an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the entire movie. The end movie with Michael Jackson sang a cover version of Song Beatle's "Come Together" and then during the credit we saw Michael Jackson songs and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael has made a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was good idea to include including a good singer and a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie I think it really carries out Imagination kids. The film is almost as imaginable as the Beatles animated film "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and you're up to a movie that has a lot of creativity this movie is. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
