I have lots of time for all the Columbo movies, but this particular one was very well written, and the solution to the end is very effective. However, my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene from the movie, between Columbo and the murderer (I apologize if I did not remember all this exactly). It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: the look is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered, and in the room beyond, lit up in the daytime. Columbo sits in a strong support tower facing the door (and we), contemplating the cupboard, and almost in silhouettes due to the contrast of light. There is no sound. The camera slowly moved out of the room and went up towards him. It's deep in meditation, gently puffing over a cigar, whirl in smoke from the maximum cigar slowly as it thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Superb.
