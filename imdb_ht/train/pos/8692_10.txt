I loved it watching. I had no idea he was part of a bigger set. I had to be 6 or so at this time she was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep passion for something that was clear on the chair of the piano pool game. My parents stuck to this television when it originally revealed on NBC. The same tea was the old Sanka coffee shop and some others. I plan to return home sometime soon and will try to record the tape on my computer so that people who want a copy can do that. If someone you would like to contact me, I think you can do this at the IMDb website feel free. I'll keep you updated and tell you when I have the show in a digital format.
