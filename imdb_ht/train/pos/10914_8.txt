I saw the Slim Man series - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but there is something awfully sweet on Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie flick. Jean Arthur SHINES when she appears in Powell. There is an underground incandescent mouth between them. This film may not have the understanding of the Slim Man series, but undoubtedly make up for it's charm. While I was watching her, I thought to be sure Powell was wearing a cut-screen affair with Arthur. My friend thought the same thing. This is one movie where I wish I could step back in time (in schmooze and silence with Powell!) There seems to be no end to his lovable smirks! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." Well, this is the way to too gushy, but I can not help myself.
