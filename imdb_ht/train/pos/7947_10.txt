I watched this movie many times in my children's hood that even in that day I could pretty much re-eyes all the dialogue. And when I look it now it just makes me happy and amazing always laughs. I think it's amazing how to manage to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they can play the main role of a feature film. However looking at her now, I can also unfortunately notice that she is not the prince I once thought she was. But I'd rather remember how I felt about it when I was younger watching it on VHS on my TV point that would cloud the image of yellow. And it brings in itself is a child's movie, which is why I would definitely give it 10/10.
