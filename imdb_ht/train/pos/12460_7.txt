Farewell friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor among thieves is not perfect, but it is a clean and fun comedy that sees unraveling French startup Algerian war veteran Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement arch, one to return their bonds thieves, others in their own out of the millions of salaries sitting there on the Christmas weekend. Of course these things are not quite simple even after opening the arch, which leads to some twists and turns. On the debit side, there is a very rare striptease scene in a car park, Bronson has a very frustrating catch-catcher Fonzie that he uses in the most unperturbed moments, Brigitte Fossey, sporting perhaps the most miserceived hairstyles of the 60s (he does it look like a bald woman whose peach blew back to the top of his head by a strong wind), is something of a responsibility ?? "I'm going to cook spaghetti! I'm going to learn to love well! I'll read Shakespeare!" speech is hysterical in every way wrong ?? and it's a shame about the terrible last line / shot, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can get a decent print. <br /> <br /> The UK DVD Cinema Club only offers the English band, but since Delon voices itself and the rest of the cast of fairly well armed this has no major problems, especially since transferring to widescreen is good kind of good.
