Panic in the open streets of high noir style, a view along a black street followed by a tilting camera equal to a window behind which playing out a card game is a slaughter - an opening bloom that, along with some of the shooting locations , anticipated some of Welles' atmosphere brought a decade later into the Evil Touch. One of the players launches the open window; it's an appropriate action, serving as an introduction to the events of as well as literally opening up our first look at the dead. <br /> The injection of high black and white contrast, the panic of the benefits benefits incredibly from a strong cast as well as some fine shoots in New Orleans. The scenes set in the places such as the mortar, crowded shipments or paintings painted 'Place Frank' paint a unique, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere, impossible to recreate in the studio. With these elements, Kazan's film shows Dassin's influence in Nude City's inauguration in two years earlier, which establishes fearless, almost documentary style in the Noir cycle. In fact, the previous role of Widmark was the same Dassin night and the city, a movie in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent. Joe MacDonald, a favorite with the director, panic photos in the streets' detailed settings. MacDonald also worked on Kazan's pinky and Viva Zapata!, And he went to shooting Widmark again three years later at Fuller's full-time pick up on South Street. As others noted, in a typical way to some film noir, Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion, illness and immorality of the streets and the modest, calm home life of the Reeds. But whereas (for example) in the Heat of the Big Heat (1953) the home life of the hero is destroyed by the vice element surrounding the central character embraced - finally sending it back to work with a vigilance increase and the essence of revenge - panic in the street where rising Reed's concerns are within the boundaries of what's just another day's work. Despite all the danger, he finally returns back to the boss of his family to justify and satisfy. Implications of social balance were restored, at least for the moment by its professionalism and healing skills. This imbalance of course, created by crime and disease. The two will be associated with this film. He recalls one of the slogans from the very cruder Cobra (1986) - where "Crime is the disease." Meet the healing, "a clean analogy in the context, if one is too uncomfortably ringing in social reductions. At its highest point, as Blackie tries to run off aboard the ship, the specially allied racist visuals looked like criminals, both taking a threat to society's health. As (probably infected) Darkie Prow round the cheap rooms and docks with his comrades, in search of something he suspects everyone is after, if without knowing exactly what it is, 'bad disease' and 'blackie "Remember together in the public mind, adding more to the association associations. The ironically hygienic about Poldi's unfortunate cousins, that "he brought something in" to the correct score - though, finally, nothing he can sell or steal. Blackie's logic assumptions that the police would not normally harass and the murder of some illegal anonymous immigrants has a true ring on it, and confusing so it's understandable. <br /> <br /> Dr. Reed, although home-loving, and on the side of society, is a true noir hero. Accustomed to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man walking alone, forcing them to travel beyond the boundaries of the law. On his way, Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society in large - a scope of the film that is particularly appetite, given to Kazan's controversial story director. The director testifies to the infamous HUAC, committing communist communists and fellow travelers. His film painted suspicions that they were spread in question, and manhandling in the press, on the grounds that public goodness was justified. Such actions may echo the director's sentiment at the time, presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights required in the light of supporting communist infiltration in the entertainment industry. At the time of terrorist threats and state responses, these issues as they appear in the movie are striking modern. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Cat like, Blackie swallows his victim in the room, eventually preying on the sickly sentence bed, holding the head Fever Poldi in his hand - a hit, cradling wrong. It is a gesture that focuses on the nature of the corruption, whether moral or physical. Apparently, the actors performed many or all their own exhibitions, leading to some other dramatic scenes in the end, as the police and health authorities close to the bandits under the stops. Half climbing, half scrubbing over the slippery woods at the edge of the dock pool must have been a very comfortable experience for Palans, but it is the sequence that adds incredibly to immediately to it all. <br /> <br /> Occasionally less Comprehensive Components distract the viewer. Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency backup government backup. Maybe just as surprising, he never inoculated himself - invites a dramatic turn that has never materialized. At the end of the film, too, the potential epidemic has stopped, all contacts are located, slightly too neatly. But these weaknesses are more than ventilated than the other satisfaction of a movie that still makes for compulsive and important look today.
