Well, have a ton of review here, what can I add add? <br /> I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything. The compositions, outdoors, costumes, are so beautiful and authentic. The sweet music. Throw in support very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. Sensitively understated his touch with his voice is the sound of my Christmas. David Warner is also a totally credible Bob Cratchit. It is a tough life, but it remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have told her portraits too gray. I could not agree more. Exchange it at the start while cold or harsh, they did not come out of character. He is a very great man of despair in their hearts hardened by the vikissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the flashbacks, it's obvious that it is not all gray. This is where we see that there is hope for it. If she was totally gone, her partner Marley would never have come for her relinquishment in the first place. After all, we are not one of our past hopes. I think it's a great part of what Dickens has tried to say. When Scrooge looks to dance to her employer and Belle, you see her smile regretfully as she says to Belle in the flashback that she will go to life "with a grin on my face." Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they get left on the floor correction floor. Finally, its conversion is so full of joy that it makes me cry water in joy every time I see it. His apology to Fred his nephew, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. Her joy brings her to Fred, his wife, so noticeable. With the line that gets me every time, "God forgives me for the time I was wasting." <br /> <br /> Bravi all!
