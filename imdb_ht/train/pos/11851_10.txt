At a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, together comes this film that reminds us of the concept of "Flood Spirit". If you feel beaten, this movie will free yourself and put you soaring. We all know how difficult life can be, at any moment we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through. That's what this movie has done for me and I hope it will be for you.
