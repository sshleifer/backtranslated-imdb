My family and I have seen this film often over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and heartwarming. Show us the compassion between two families in two countries thousands of miles apart and not the worst of coincidence, it's almost as if God's hand had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 Jodelle Micah Ferland who plays the hearty little girl's heart, doing a great job of acting her party, and for me she was the Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> In all, a 10 out of 10. There is no inconvenience in this sweet human story. Children of all ages will be tearfully, then happy to look at this and will bring the family look with smiles and good feelings.
