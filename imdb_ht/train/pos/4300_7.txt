This movie can be quite one of these ordinary "soap" related to the day-to-day event of half a dozen families whose lives are tied ?? broken relationships, building new friends, street bashings, near crash, hoping and dreaming and even the discovery of a baby abandoned under some bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> Fortunately the movie maker goes beyond these daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks ?? In this chaotic world doing things just happen, it's just lucky when things turn out right or, take a fatalistic view, is a preestated person to be in a certain place at a certain time and thus get involved in events and with his future take on a new perspective? Most of us have experienced this mysterious experience. <br /> Is it our super to believe we are so important? As a character say ?? He once sat on the corner overlooking the Grand Canyon and realized how indifferent he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movie but is a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role.
