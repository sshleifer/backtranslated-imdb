Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than his material, and almost always beneath appreciated. He was in a ton of films either as a heavy or hero, and he has strong qualities, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can deliver material that would sound ridiculous coming from another actor, and that's what's so great about it. It really seems to mean what he says, regardless of how modest, obvious or comic, that puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what has been doing the WALKING TALL Trilogy work well, and even magic is here in the final justice. This was a substantial hit in theaters and videos of the 80s, and he had a much better age than many of the best-known effectiveness actions in the era. By moving the action in Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless real-world that does not jam you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I still enjoy the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director of the same vein as Clint Eastwood 1970, and this is one of his best. FINALIST JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN on fire at its great gravity and violence. I suppose if they notice this with the Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.
