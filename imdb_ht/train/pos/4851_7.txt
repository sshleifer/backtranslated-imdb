Ghost Train is a fine and fun film typical of the British comedy cold in the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedy Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once appeared, but this can be overcome by looking at it as a piece of period or curiosity. <br /> For a low-budget war production, the Holy Train is atmospheric, efficient, and provides some genuine suspension. Great fun for a black (and, yes, storm) night. Blink up, take off the hat, and enjoy.
