I really wonder how this show plays in U.K. and the rest of Europe. It is so one-dog about to be an American (particularly white Indian). Which could be a great reason for some of the veins and vitriol that is expressed here on this chart. I enjoy the show but it is with some reservations and I feel it's been taking the most easy way out of Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie has locked the door locked on any hope of repelling the show unless his character lands on a large grass stack in the middle of some farms. What do you know? It was a funny, raunchy and on occasion, kind of scary show.
