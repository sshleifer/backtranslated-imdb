Surprised to see the note instead of this movie. Just saw this film for the first time in 10 years, and she recalls why I love her. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, at a time when Michael Keaton was a straight-up comedy guy, and you might get some joy in this movie. It's a Ron Howard's gentleman's comedy specializing in - but if it's your thing, you should check this out. Keaton's low-key rooms are just good for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit dated, because it takes place at the world's final pre-global economy, when it's still related to a country based business. say, he delivers laughs as well as a lesson about how people can learn from each other, in great benefit. <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one particular scene you really liked, but that's because the movie all gives a slow but constant laugh. It's like an I.V. drip. And I mean that in a great way.
