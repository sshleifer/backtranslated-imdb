I hate reading reviews that say something like, 'Do not waste your time, this movie feels on ice.' He does look back to me, he may have some sort of naive charm. If you like the other films 'Whistler', this one will look. If you love 40 noirish films, this one will look. <br /> This movie is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the earlier series entries that starred Richard Dix as the protagonist. It's slower, and the plot is trite. You've seen this narrative device even used in many other films, and usually better. But the act is good, and so is the lighting, and the dialogue. It just lacks energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going out to the end no more than a quarter of the way off. The 'Whistler' series is semi-noir, and there are characters, mood, lighting, camera motion and angles are more important than the story itself. But this movie is not black. It's too light and Hollywood innocent. Nor the character Richard Dix nor those of any of his ladies in the movie before they came to a good end. You just never knew until the end. <br /> But still, I'll recommend this one for at least one look. I watched it at least twice myself, and got a reasonable amount of fun out of it both times.
