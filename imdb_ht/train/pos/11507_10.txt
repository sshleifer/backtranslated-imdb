I remember the original series clearly mainly due to it's unique mix of humorous wry and rifficulty. Kolchak was hard-biting newsman from Ben Hecht's school in the big city report, with his bravest determination, and wise-minded mothers made the same day as the most eminently watched. My personal fave is the "Mossers Hispanic Moss" due to its totally original storyline. A poor, Cajun kid from Louisiana countryside, takes part in a sleeping experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. Something goes inexplicably wrong, and it literally dreams of a swamp creature lives the dark folk stories of his youth. This malware manifestation seeks all those who have the nightmares in his conscious state, and brutally suffocates them to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this terrible truth, much of the grief of police captain Joe "Mad Dogs" Siska (beautifully described by a Keenan Wynn Mosel) and top sleeping researchers performed by founding 2nd Improv, Severn Darden, in the role, understated perfection. The ridiculous villain, old capture takes place in the Chicago sewer system, and it is a series highlight. Kolchak has never been any better. Timeless.
