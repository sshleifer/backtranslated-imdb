"Fear of a black hat" is everything (the weakest) "CB-4" should be. Eye Rusty Cundieff's satire is gracious, as it wrinkles, wrinkles, and mutilates all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. Is "FoaBH" similar to Tap lighting? Yes, a bit. Is It Deteriorated in Spinach Tap? No, not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is best focused, and to be honest, it's funnier.
