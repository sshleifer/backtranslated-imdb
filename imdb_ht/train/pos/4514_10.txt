I recently looked at this movie, in a lazy afternoon afternoon, with some friends and we have a lot of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of garbage. Try to look at it with this goal! It was not expected, of course, but the performances provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low budget cost created an amazing mix of crazy stuff. Tomba was just retired from alpine skiing, where he was a dominant skye technique in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships, and nine World Cup titles. Seriously about the director: nobody knows why Damiano Damiani has signed this film. All other directions Damiani are considerable.
