My super girlfriend was turning out to be a wonderful surprise for me, I really expected a terrible movie that would probably have stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie has many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone can get a kick from. I know that this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such a great addition and a great cast that looked like they had lots of fun and that's what made the movie really work. > <br /> Jenny Johnson (awesome, this is my best friend's current) is not your typical way of looking at librarians, when Matt, your average man, ask him out, he's in for over it Hopefully, he asked G-girls out on a date, the super hero of the world! But when she finds what a girl is jealous and crazy she really is and decides that she can be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny will not have it since she fell for another girl, Ana , and he will make his life a living hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not have chosen a better girl to break up with. <br /> <br /> The effect was assembled, but you seriously moved past quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was like a step up from Prime. My Super Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not really take seriously, it's just a nice romantic comedy that I think if I could get a laugh out of it, anyone could.
