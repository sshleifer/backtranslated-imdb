Walking home after the movie, I had to paint the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre danced. I heard that before - where? Ah, from the "Eyes Wide Shut" Kubrick (track 2), got it just as I got to the door. She's "Waltz No 2 from Jazz Suite No 2" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and picked up the band from the Tower. What a treat! Movie Scores by Alexandre Desplat have been completed - there are fifteen trains extra in the delightful Walzer. It's not often these days we get an entirely soundtrack dedicated to a complete movie. Remind me of my favorite notes by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (beginning of track record 6 has track of "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue, and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of tension and scores from the strings, celeste, piano, and guitar. Emily Watson and John Turturro released a credible performance performance. The love story, intimate connection, is extensively between Alexandre and Natalia - her child yet painful inner world, with her generous and bold understanding - a relationship to both. Director of Marleen Gorris at the Antonia Line (Best Film Awards 1996 Academy Award in the Netherlands) gave us a slowly sensitive film - not human, human, humorous, obsession, family effort, love, and respect. The front-end subject is the idea-game with mathematical logic of failure. Under it can be a mild tearjerker in a series of dramas in the late 1920s. Cinematography captures serene beauty in Lake Como in northern Italy near the border of Switzerland. <br /> I highly recommend the band if you do not feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplat in film lyric films in the "Luzhin Defense" is complete.
