Consider the lack of art and African films (or Black American movies). The idea offers a multi-dimensional look at a community that is assigned to automotive and dealers. But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short. But it is unstoppable statement of independence from those terms that are most sticky. The genre is unique and does not look in typical. It is almost this starting point that catches the eye, so watching it twice is crucial. The film has a high quality aesthetic that lends itself to the true art of cinema. And it is this true art that with a very African voice. The film is not copied to its message, it's innovative and provocative by pulling subtle stereotypes (not racial but stereotypical-based characters), From a movie perspective the film is brilliant. It brings multiplication messages including a very quick character development. It must be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish characters very quickly. The color texture and music will also be congratulated. But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's latest venture, 500 years later, music should be expected. But from a point-point view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satir eludes indirectly to a social problem ?? brilliant stuff!
