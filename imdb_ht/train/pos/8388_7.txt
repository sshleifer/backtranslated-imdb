Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presenting fully and credible, despite being so bent on implosiveness. He will do everything to make his wedding work, including cynical opportunism and sexual manipulation. So, under the vicey exterior, it reveals a rather sweet system. The film suffers from an abrupt end and then it feels completely, and the conveniences are familiar from finishing your school writing writing skills and 'and then I got up.' It is also book-ended at the other end with the most unique title sequence I've ever seen, but do not let any of that put you there.
