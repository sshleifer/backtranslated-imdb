I will never forget when I saw this title in how to store video back air. I've always been a big fan of fans and when I saw the video I was renting and watching it. I was too small to appreciate all subtle and satirical humor moments at the time but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was looking at. If you are an "al" fan, especially to his earlier work, you will enjoy this movie quite well. He is born on the MTV-esque "Rockumentary" and tells a story (true, but sometimes exaggerated) how Al came to where he was in 1985. You will love it if you love his humorous brand, and most importantly, music li.
