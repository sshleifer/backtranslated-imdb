Deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn, every single turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the movie, and it often makes no sense, although they usually catch you by surprise. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has a lot of twist. The scenario is very good with great dialogue and character, but you can not catch all the development because of the twists. Performances are not particularly surprising by Caine. The very good direction, Sidney Lumet can be direct. The visual effects are just, but the longer they are actually in a play and they are fake. Twist ways are so many, but still working and worth watching.
