Just see the movie, and the scary thing was, people are talking during the movie sounding just like the actors. The movie had its moments, but also deplorable and was rather sick. It's all meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think that yourself "People like this is all around us" All attempts at getting the sympathy of the audience anched as actors do one thing stupid after another. On the plus side, there are some big (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for videos - but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes his shirt in the movie! (not a nice eye!)
