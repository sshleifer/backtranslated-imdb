I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won Oscar Best Actress for this movie by slamming into a three-way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty Drives of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton, and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race . But the informer is still a fine movie because John Ford would not have gotten first his best Oscar Director if he did not. Do not split that involves the award. The film and the story by Liam O'Flaherty is based on the involvement of a poor scholar of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. She had been shouting from her for some imbalist stunting pulls and she wants to come back in. She's down to his last penny and if she can not get back to, wanting enough for the passage in America. There is a reward book twenty for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. At a time of weakness, she goes to Black and Tan's stability and is informed about McPhillip. The IRA is very worried to find out who has gathered McPhillip out and they are sure McLaglen. He does not have the understanding to really cover his own tracks. He made a tough effort to involve another person named Peter Mulligan playing by Donald Meek. She also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan. The whole action of the Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from six in the early morning evening. In a necessity he was shot in darkness and shadow, making it perhaps the first comedy noir. He had made the post of World War II The Informator would be classified as a classic big noir, like Odd or Third personality that it bares a lot of resemblance. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well. It took some time during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother in IRA. Her real name before she was anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays captain of IRA Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is someone tougher and those who mean Foster has him here. I guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give some fans some rooting interests. It makes it clear that Foster has eliminated the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization into danger. <br /> <br /> The scene of IRA trial is to highlight the movie. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes authority in the courts, Meek is not in a position to say no. The king's justice and writing do not run here. It graphically shows at this point despite occupation by army troops and stability, the British are indeed losing their grip on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course the informer of a story rather than having its John Ford touch, but rather less than you would expect. As McLaglen spends his money on a drunken spirit, the IRA is constantly in the shade watching it, counting each farthing. <br /> <br /> The informer is a well-known story about Ireland in a time of manure and involvement.
