I saw this film at least six times, being the first time in 70 years, in the movie theater. In September 07, 2002, I bought the DVD to import and see it again. Yesterday I saw this movie once more. Even after many years, this film is still awesome. The creepy and horrendous story of the same day is present. Throw is a constellation of the stars and starlets. You can see many actors and actresses, who became famous, from the beginning of careers. Fans of horror movies certainly adore the 'Sentinel', and I'm one of them. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
