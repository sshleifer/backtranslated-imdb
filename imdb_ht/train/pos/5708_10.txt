This is so interesting! After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted little movie, I consider this one a real treat! This is absolutely delightful with one of the best pictures I've seen this year. It is surprisingly more since it's an early talkie and put some great pictures in the 30's of shame due to its innovative use of sounds in movies. It's simply full of music and an adorable attitude that's really optimistic and, bottom line, it made me happy! Obviously it would not be so difficult to retrieve the lead lottery ticket men looking for, but the march is so exhilarating with the movie so spectacularly entertaining that I did not even think of it twice. The comedy is often hilarious and I think it is even superior to Marx Brothers, perhaps the greatest comedy force in the allotted time. This is rather perfect.
