"My son, my sister, dreams <br /> <br /> How sweet all of this would look like <br /> <br /> Are we in that kind of country to live together, love slow down and time, Have love and die in the middle <br /> Those scenes that are your images, which are beautiful weather. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> Based on novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Anachanted April" can be described in one sentence ?? It took place in the early 1920s when four London women, four foreigners decided to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - an ultimate "feel good" movie is perfection in its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magic, it is like a sun rays on your face during spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop the moment of tranquility happiness and caring for it forever. This is the movie that actually affects my life. I watched it during difficult times when I lost, happy and very lonely, when I was dealing with the sad and tragic events and coming to terms with some unflattering truths about myself. It helped me regain my optimism and hope that anything can change and anything is possible. I promise myself then no matter what, I would pull myself out of self-pity and misery and I would appreciate every minute of life - with her joy and sadness ... I was promising myself that I would go to Italy and later this year I did and I was not alone. Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made with eternal love. This little movie is a diamond of highest quality.
