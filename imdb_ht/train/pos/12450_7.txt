Rent and look at this short (<90 minute) work. She's far from the best treatment Modesty got on film - with her creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees, participating as a "Creative Consultant." The character, and we who love her, are busy with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best it did on date, and the casting was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as an original match by Jim Holdaway illustrating modesty. A terrific get to anyone who threw it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & Co. will go on doing more in the series - I'm especially interested to see who they would choose to be Willie Garvin's incomparable!
