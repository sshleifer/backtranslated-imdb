This was excellent. Touch, action-packed, and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this film, it deserved more than 5.3 or so stars. This film is the story of an outdated soldier who learns more of life than soldiers, and those who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend. I was crying, laughing and mostly sitting in awe of this story. Good work written for an action flick, and the draw was appropriate and fairly solid. The finish was not twisty, but it was still excellent. If you love to escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. Not a amount of sore throat or violence, it was not difficult to look at that respect. Something for everyone.
