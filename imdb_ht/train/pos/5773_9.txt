Since I'm interested in lunar monsters I really searched this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like this terrible movie quality is checked it out. The effects are really good as well just think "Land of the Lost". I originally watched this movie in the early 90s maybe more like 89/90 on a local channel show called "Morgus Presents". I did not scare me but I was 8 and nothing B felt more like an A. Years later I saw it on DVD in a local Circuit City and bought it immediately so I could give it a 9 because it has a personal place in my heart right there and the Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
