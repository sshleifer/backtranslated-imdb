"Good time," in my opinion, is a must-see CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really like the theme song. If you ask me, though I love everyone, it would have been nice if everyone lived on the show during all of its run. Everybody always gives a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was still very strong. In conclusion, even if it can be seen on TV land right now, I recommend you catch it just in case it goes into the air for good.
