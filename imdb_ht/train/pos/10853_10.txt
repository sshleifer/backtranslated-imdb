This film is tremendous for outlining the minds. Every time I look at it, I see and hear funny little things that I missed before. <br /> <br /> The incredible soundtrack. Mick Jones (Foreign) and Chris Difford (press) taught the songs that make strange fruits the best thing ever to hit today's music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, strange fruits are a strictly fictitious washing up '60 to 70 bands that are never good to begin with, due to drug use and inner battles. One of the wonderful things that would be, while listening to their fanatistic tape. <br /> <br /> The fruit draws inspiration from the rolling stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie, and the Ki. Members of the Fruits are quite memorable. Stephen Rea starred as Tony Costello down-and-dead-broke, who was asked by a festival promoter to assemble his band for a reunion tour, and hoping to recover monetary benefits. Costello haply approaches ancient Roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, helping him to rewind the flame of an ancient dream. <br /> <br /> Juliet rallied upside down Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), Blundering Timeline Spall David 'Beano' Baggot), with extravagantly glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). The Tumbling is another old roadie, the Hughie hippy-toker-jokester (Billy Connolly), who never let the flame burn out. <br /> <br /> As Juliet's research for the latest members of the bandwagon, the elusive Gitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Bruce Robinson), the members reunited squabble, just like old times, fighting over talented each other '. It is the group giving the chance to make a small Dutch trip, preparing for the festival. With young Hendrix like Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) taking place Lovell, the crew hit the road. Sparks are flying as the flame flash memory, threatening burning goal ends ... <br /> You must prepare to laugh, sing, apply, and cry, as these memorable characters turn their heads back into your heart. .
