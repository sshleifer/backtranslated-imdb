Was such an ambient production failed to its main goal, which was correctly adapted to Allende's novel? Obviously yes. August Bille manages to make a superficial, deep film where basic elements of South American mentality are presented simply as side events, causing total inconsistencies. I can not believe that there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! There are high-quality techniques in this movie and I think the actors have done their best and what they have at hand, but something is missing. And this was the most important part.
