Wonderful British airline jet plane George Taylor (a solid painting by Guiseppe Pambieri) gets beaten into thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with Sweet Emi Wong's sweet and virgin Dr. (a wonderful good performance by Chai Lee's handsome). George regains his health and returns to work. When Emy failed to hear from George for a long time, he succumbed to despair and became a whore. While director / co-writer Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of nudity to hoping to taste delicious and steam-soft sex, this movie is anything but ride your routine into leafy sleaze. Instead it is an amazing, touching and tragic love story between two characters well-drawn and very appealing (Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing). The picture starts out bubbly and cheerful, but the tone radically shifts into a more agitated and harsh atmosphere about two-thirds of the way. Emy's descent of vice after he was allegedly supposed that George had abandoned it is weak and upsetting; This bummer is remarkably sad and heartbreaking is supposed to end. Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too funny or trashy. In addition, the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even really erotic. Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice sized part supporting as George Jalouzi and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guinness polished Guido Mancori offers many gorgeous gorgeous shots in the exotic places. Nico Fidenco's function, gobbling notes hit the groovy place. Worth a look for someone looking for something different.
