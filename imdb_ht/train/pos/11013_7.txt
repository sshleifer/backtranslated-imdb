There have been a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years held by drums up support for our troops from the public. Seeing today, some may postpone them or just see them as propaganda - which are technically, but in a positive sort and mean that they unify the nation. This film is a very effective and fun example of the genre - there is a wonderful realistic script and good production value. Pat O'Brien plays the very handsome character he played in many other films (you know, hard-talking, hard-driven but "swollen guy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bomber in training). While the story is reminiscent of several other movies on our pilots and teams, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That he, perhaps, except for the very end - where the movie is a bit over-the-top, but also very satisfying. Regarding only serious negatives, and this is especially for nitpickers, that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated into the movie and "black" like me that both story profiles and plane lovers will probably notice this - Everyone else probably will not notice.
