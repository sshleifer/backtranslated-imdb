RADIO RADIO can be summarized by Thomas Newman's note. It's haunting and beautiful, but you'll know that this music is similar to other Newman's works and while listening to the band you are reminding of SCENT at a woman, JOE Black meeting and the SHAWSHANK deduction you will recall in the movie other as story unfolding on screen. As the American Sullivans drive tries to escape from a psychotic hit you think of the GAYWAY, Irish gangsters are the Millers crisis as well as the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by the Gangster and Leone epic. Despite having a look at it all before this feeling should not be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes movie that I repeat is haunting and beautiful with the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening minute and I was a bit as confused as the incident caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stop considering how much of a santle of Playberg slogan can do with the story that revolves around a father and his 12 year old son, his son runs for their lives you can not help thinking what a superb Mendes Director is <br /> <br /> ROAD FOR PERDITION is a movie where the cast gives all inferior performances. I've never been all keen on Tom Hanks but it's every bit as good here as she's been in any role starting, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point I believed I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body body, his character is torn up by hand but Newman guilty Never milk it or go to the top. While never upstaging Newman that gives the best performances of the film of Brit supporting actors Craig and Laws are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Laws will always be a long career as a leading actor of one thing wonders. Daniel Craig may have been acting as an actor character if he has not decided to become James Bond, a role that is the end of an actor's career
