The sitcom turns on a girl who must learn to be responsible for his own actions. As he has the power of magic, he often uses it to try to help his loved ones or oneself, often causing literal bread that are often disastrous and still funny. The program began with Sabrina's adventures in the fictional city of Westbridge, located near Boston, Massachusetts (as opposed to Greendale in the comics). In later seasons, Sabrina graduated from high school and was enrolled in college, then moved on his attempt to live on his own and holding a job in the local newspaper. Breaking more out of her comic roots, the show ended with Sabrina's wedding, although, in the end, she abandoned the wedding and ran with Harvey. Many episodes involving Sabrina will come to meet, in natural or supernatural means, popular folk music artists of the time, such as Coolio, violent films, Backstreet Boys, Phantom Planets, Davy Jones of the Monkees, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Daniel Bedingfield, Hanson, Eden in Crash, Savage Garden, 'N Sync, and Ashanti. Courses of nature, the band of Melissa Joan Hart's then -conpayon (now husband) Mark Wilkerson, appeared in an episode of 2002.
