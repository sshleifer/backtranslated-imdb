If, unlike some of the comments here, you do not engage in a class war and do not mind seeing other people fairly successful, extroverted, reckless (gasp) and not being terribly English at a party and getting in all kinds of issues as a result of this is not a bad movie, closer to Euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual American slick crap ... I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad movie Doing, I'm defending this, the movie is not any worse as a result, and puts the spotlight on the cast, some of them are really good (Kate Hardie - think that's his name, like The sarcastic drink is spot-on) one exception being David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious things! It's light, and we do not go for this kind of anatomizing-of-relationship crap in this country, but if you do not have any real friends to go to a party and than you could do worse than sitting at them and look at this.
