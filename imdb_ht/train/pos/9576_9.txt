One of the most nihilist and brutal films I have ever seen, but one of them is more tragic and moving. This is an action-melodramm like the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the draw was locked in tears, while at the time of delivering shocking revelations as a bone-crunching bold blow. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK-cop and a Cambodian assassin hunt each other, while little bit lost humanity, is a strong one. Featuring very little dialogue in favor of haunting cameras and brave cameras, "dog biting dogs" are most HK-blood without the heroism.
