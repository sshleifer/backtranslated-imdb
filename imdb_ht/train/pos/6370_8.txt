For my surprise, I really liked Disney's installment last installment. The film had its lows, but in general I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate. It was also nice to see an Disney movie animation that was not a music. I was about to push through the boundaries with Tarzan. Fortunately, the music was given a rest. Another nice feature of the movie is that the comedy has not been completely dumbed down (a Hercules), rather subtle so it always makes kids laugh while not adult feel they are either just or foolish. A deception was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a bit. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities and the history of Atlantis! Overall the movie was fun, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
