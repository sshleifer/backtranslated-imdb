by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is filming, not only with Ralph Bakshi, being reported a satire allegory of blaxploitation and negative black estereyot films, as well as a look at black life in modern America ( modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount falls like a hot potato that flies in flame. <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. Not just another random "shock-jock" in a movie that tries to hit the shock due. Not Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something great to say ... Although it's rooted in cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another knock-off stand in mainstream white film or any kind of moving cops. "Coonskin" wants more. It sets its sights higher and fry some bigger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie is not just keen to please the genre. Nor it just indicates black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strange places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story from some prisoners awaiting a prison-prison. The fact that it even possible to break out of a prison in the world "Coonskin" alone makes it old-fashioned. One of the prisoners tells a story about a trio of Dark Brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Fox Fox who wants to respect with a piece of action and they want to get it by any means needed. The Itallian mob is running all the real action. Big black music star name: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black drama to take home Pulitzer's home. A great thing is happening here obviously. The movie plays as a descendant of this world, this side is divided into the racial. From an angry, hip, deep, soulfully black man with a hatred in his heart with a gun in his hand. Bakshi's movie never knows the meaning of the word "sublety." This one seems to have never heard of the word. But maybe a topic like this needs extreme. Real sledgehammer satire. Some topics can not be addressed slowly. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is God-dammed relentlessly. Here, no member or minority in the Harlem scene appears unscathed. The characters here are "animated" to "real" all depending on what the attitude and situation. Characters are animated with people who share the same reality and they are meant to be just as literally. Bakshi never just shows caricature ugly just for the value of shock. He always has something to say. Nor is black-face is gratuitously. Here, unlike Spike Lee in "Bamboozled," she seems to be using it to try and really say something. Like 99.9% of all Bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just being gimmicky here. All this technique is all tied, meshing while saying something. Somehow, this one feels inevitably dates. Many of these types of films (Bakshi's included) are very topical, very sturdy at this time. They reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back at them later years, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truths). Even if the music, clothing, jargon and the city clearly looks like photos that belong to a time capsule, the attitude, the mind and the heart remain the same by the matter of what it is. Anyone who really sees movies, states of things and has been in the company of the people to know what I'm talking about. Even some of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny) of a big olympic and a fox. One of the most regrettable and cynical racist characters is a Harlem-warm gem room on these trails "n ----- s" after the death of a cop. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who put the shield. It's just fun pure racial sadistic of black wounds. Sequell involving the godfather and her lady is one of the most moving pieces of the entire movie, crowded. She plays out as an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Line of promo: WARNING: "This movie offend everyone!" This is not just hype. Continue with great care. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> by Dane Youssef
