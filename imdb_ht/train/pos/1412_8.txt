Why Earth Should You Explain the Nature of Nature "Documentary"? How long have you been to earth to explain this to you? OK, I will not expand my exploration on the "Infinity" Earth, but I must stand on this ground because it's a "must see". The documentary takes a round trip to nature on the migration path on three animal families: a polar bear bear and her children and lead the real life of dad carries her out to hunt for food in his isolated way, a mother in a Candles and Whale babies take a candle of a migration trip to animals, with an elephant mother and her little (maybe not so small, they are elephants) seed migration to Africa. Director of Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield has made a "from this earth" working in capturing the skills to survive in many other species of animals besides the magnetic shots of our three protagonists. Cinematographically qualified teams at Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Portfolio, Adam Ravetch, and Andrew Shillabeer were cats in cameras who shot their beautiful nature and animal instinctive behavior; Not to mention the animals' animal shells have been in the air and they are here. "Earth" is also a lesson lesson on the global heating effect on animals; The polar bear dad of the doc is the animal poster boy about the consequence. So, fellow earthlings, it's time to take the travel documentary to visit "Earth" today! **** Well
