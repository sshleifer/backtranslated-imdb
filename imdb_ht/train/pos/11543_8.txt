Neil Simon has quite a body at work, but it is the Odd couple who brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry. Throwing in support for this movie is also stellar. <br /> It's about 2 people living together from opposite planets. The script will be with humor from this situation. This was done in some form already. This is the one that brings it all together into a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did some decent jobs, but this one is really the best job he did to make the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine Simon all the time.
