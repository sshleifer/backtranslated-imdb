Since this is Black History Month and I reviewed the achievements of many African Americans on the chronological order film, I got this movie about VHS in the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were in it. The jazz version of Franz Liszt's Rhapsody has emphasized this especially to the death of many mysteries-musical comedy. Many other numbers I love were especially Kitty Carlisle's "Kitty Marijuana", "Cocktails for Two" Carl Brisson as well as her drugs and Carlisle on earlier, and these are not Gertrude Michael's great as the woman you love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go a little too long and love / hate them as the producer and detective but they grow on you. And Toby Wings is a sexy dumb tease as Nancy keeps trying to say something in Oakie but gets a "Not now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a motive for those who kill them, I was not surprised by the revelation of those who did it. And get a charge of how naked women are here (even though the breasts are covered, either by hand or some head reducing). This was very obviously pre-code. Worth a look for any movie football interested in this sort of thing. P.S. As a longtime Louisiana resident, I love nothing when someone was born here as Carlisle was a New Orleans native.
