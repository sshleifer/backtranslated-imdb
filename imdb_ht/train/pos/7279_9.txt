My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 (I always loved scary movies) and even then I loved it. The atmosphere is awesome with the original and fun story. I especially love the scenes where the RV is under attack in the desert. The stones are actually being persuaded for such a low-budget budget. The act is higher than average for these types of films and the music is unusual. This is definitely a gem-rated gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes the unusual films from the late sixties, early eighties such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Massacre Hospital", and "Returning to Foreigners they are dangerous to Spread ". Definitely a classic !!
