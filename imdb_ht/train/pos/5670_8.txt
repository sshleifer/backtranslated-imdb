Esther Williams becomes her first MGM post and begins to become a good start. This movie is an entertaining fun that has fun <br /> with a mature theme that might repeat a million more times <br /> in the future - innocent tight girl pride creepy woman. Esther <br /> <br /> looks very much and if she wants, probably could go to <br /> <br /> to make more and better movie, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br / > pretty much abandoned working for marriage. Either way it is so logical and engaging that its fun sees it in a totally different role <br /> outside of the 'swimming of music'. Universal was fabulous for <br /> making film and star MGM star after that studio started <br /> <br /> its biggest names as it started to slip down hill. Stars <br /> <br /> like Lana Turner, Jen Allyson and others made first-hand quality <br /> <br /> movie rate at Universal as they are obviously still powered by <br /> box office. I wish Esther had done more but since he was not, he <br /> <br /> make this one all the more special.
