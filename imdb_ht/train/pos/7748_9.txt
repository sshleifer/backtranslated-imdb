Tom had a desire to make films for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn notebook from great little ideas he has filed and carrying around for 10 years. There is no transformation character grant, there is no Hollywood just life life with a little bit of magic. The balance, at speed, in the weird of comedy vs drama is perfectly squeezed. This movie takes you on a journey that's about before you realize how beautiful it was. The music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfying. The fact that this film is about nothing, simply a sequence of drawings of those who mostly linked depression to one of the characters, making it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. in between the lines that are happening. to see or not see, that's the?
