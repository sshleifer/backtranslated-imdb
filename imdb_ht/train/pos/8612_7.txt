I completely agree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how can "Hollywood" just throw off a gay sign character in the movie. And besides there were two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it was not over the head. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other criticism had the power to actually watch the movie all they would see that his character developed in out the movie did not interact with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed into the junkyard you could see around her mother out there and later in the movie you saw that she was too irresistible. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and defective characters then this movie is bad. But if you are more open-minded and I do not know actually have some tips at what's fine then you'll enjoy this movie.
