I'm afraid it was a movie that you actually have to find anything out of it. It's not a mindless movie like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" Do you know one of where Riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is pretty much even in the end as it is a beginning. you can run everywhere on the phone to do what ever and enjoy it in any way.I have noticed in the past that most people do not like this type of movie are the kind that will do nothing but watch a movie and then slam it because ..... the duh does not find it or understand it or what happened. <br /> Do not let your drugs take a shower !!!
