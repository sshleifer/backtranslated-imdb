This miracle in a movie is one of those films that have a long lasting, long-term effect on you. I have read a review or two from mad who I guess are republicans or baby beats, and extremist remarks to talk about these movies may confront people with their own darkest secrets. No such piece of art ever combines laughter and tears in my eyes before and that's the miracle of the movie. The realistic of the film and his performances by Bret Carr will not fail. The pretty nature of almost interactive effects will cause people to leave the theater either liberating or questioning their many identities. Bravo on the next level of movies.
