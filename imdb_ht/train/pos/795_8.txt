Too bad a couple of comments before I do not know the information in this case. It is based on current events, a very extensive disappearance and murder cases taking place in the Wilmington region, DE / Philadelphia PA from '96 through 2000. I must admit I was very uncertain of how Hollywood would dramatize the current and events and was actually quite impressed about how close they stay in what has been being reported on local newscasts and Philadelphia News Inquirer news stories in the long term. Of course I immediately notice that the actress (whom I really love in Cold Case) who played Fahey look nothing like it (Anne Marie was actually more beautiful). I have to admit if Mark Harmon really nailed the personality that was revealed as Capano and behaviors that Capano had exposed at that time. Details of the case were good on ... there is no deviation of dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet, guns, furniture, and cooler. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper many times in various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so happy that he pulled the strings in the Federal field needed to solve this crime crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see it finally put behind bars.
