First, I mean, "Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all the animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Editions 1999)! What You Will Do you like Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Anyways, Disney remains magic in 1950s animated her classic movie "Cinderella," the movie that puts movie fairy tale on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepisters, dates, the glass shoe, the pumpkin that comes in a carriage just saying "Bippity - boppity-boo!", And of course, trying to head home by night ! <br /> What I like about this movie is an old story tale story that kids love, now in a movie form (as well as on DVD as well) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
