Wow, I can not believe I'm the first one and one to post a comment on this great movie. Although the film itself seemed interesting enough to real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt Lillard, most people gratefully probably either think it is too caffeine happy or just plain suck but we are both the same age and in the same generation and I have watched this guy many times that he is one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where it is the big shot and type of star as in SLC Punk, another big movie Lillard. <br /> <br /> This Baiscally is storywise movie your heist but with more twists than anything, which begins in the amount of frenzy. Also remarkably reminiscent of this movie is another great actress called Vincent D'onofrio, a very benevolent man in the movie industry. The woman in the movie is a new and not too bad although you know she was hired to mostly accentuate her with the nude scene =) It's a game of Jack vs. Jill vs Bob as every one wants to reap the rewards but share it by there is one. They all try to find each other to kill the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his great ability as JAck's scheming that initially begins the whole plot. Vincent and the women play a couple of stealing art in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit disturbing with the skitz in the movie but only adds to the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> The surprises left and right are welcome and the finish is very clichy and make you feel happy, well maybe depending on the type of endings you like. This movie keeps me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies. The criticism probably will not like this movie, but they do not watch movies cause them to love movies anyway.
