An accident meteorite at Crater Lake, the heat comes from the impact that causes a prehistoric egg in peel. <br /> <br /> Well, so the draw is just garbage. But despite its obvious budget, this comes across as one of the most exciting and fun monster-on-the-movie films of existence. There are also some good moments in humor. At one age filled out so-called 'monsters' that are no more than ridiculous hands-in-tires-costume creations or leza dresses in frills and forcing them to rip each other into pieces (cheap-exploit-style), it's worthwhile to discover That the Plesiosaur in this small gem is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-movement creature. <br /> <br /> Quite a hard movie to get, but it's worth finding.
