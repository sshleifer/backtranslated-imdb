The summary for this movie is a great job of explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Good shot. Hard to believe he was Bill Paxton's first budget director, though some shots look exactly like a storyboard version. <br /> Still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the Paxton part. <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists in the end, several of them, all credible, full of fun, and best of all, hiding also enough to make true twists. <br /> <br /> Children actors in the movie do a great, too. I'm usually wary of movies and the kid starts roles because all too often come as Nickelodeon rejects, but both kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not gory. It's not scary. But it's very, very creepy.
