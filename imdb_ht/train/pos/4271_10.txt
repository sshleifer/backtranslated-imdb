This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> I saw the movie on Dutch TV sometime in 1988 (?) .. That month have shown an Uzbek film every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name in which I do not remember. If you know it, please let me know! In any case, how can I get to see this movie again ???? A DVD in this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name in which I do not remember.
