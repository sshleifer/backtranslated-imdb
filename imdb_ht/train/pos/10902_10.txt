I was very moved when I watched the movie.how jonny was able to hold such hopes and faith was amazing. so many people only care about what they want, and the fuss about everything they do not have. and they are like small things, like chats, money a new car. I saw people in tears because of a disability. This movie brings everything back to the basics. Love, hope the beauty of simple things, but that's important in life.it to make everyday problems we see for them are small and really important. you look at this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you .You are really blessed. And it says to stop and smell the roses really have a new meaning.and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him very much for sharing these faiths, strenght, and humor with me .chank you jonny i know you soar the sky and bring lots of love and lair to the sky the higher.
