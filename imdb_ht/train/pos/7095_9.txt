Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short movie LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touching your heart's thanks to the superb cast. Gilliam's flair for phantasmagorical and script works by David and Janet Peoples to play with yourself as much as it does with the poor James Cole (Willis Steve McQueen like it - better than McQueen, even!), A Time- Traveled Condemned from the future that literally does not know if it will come or go as a team of scientists holds it back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 epidemic that's harmful to humans, but innocent of the animals. Willis, Justice Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist gives some of the best performances in their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style note haunted. That's one of a don't-missing!
