I watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. This film is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror", and "Dancer Dance". Barbara Steele, is her usual cute / climbs her own. George Riviere, lead men, to do a good job with his role. The whole movie is flowing with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension at all. The angle of the cameras is good and the act, for the most part, is not bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD uncut version, which is far superior to the TV version modified. Grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy. Jan R. Tracy
