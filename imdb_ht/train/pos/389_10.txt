yes right. Sammo Hung already acts in the main role of 1983 "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain". Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu warriere". But this time, it finally makes it right. You rarely see it in wuxia, most often in classic Eastern or slapstick crimes. But this role simply fit him! Ancient Chinese monks on the hill are often represented in movies (as far as I know about movies translated to the west). Although, the legend has a vast range of interesting stories and possibilities. Straightly said: You have not seen a story again in a modern movie! And that's so great! And Wow: The more colors the story really deep, in the heart-to-heart will make you fall for this movie at a time. The first time I watched it, I had to look it up immediately, and I did. OK, I did not understand it all the first time. But that makes it only better! You know, you did not understand it all, because there is plenty of spice in it! That is why it is a pleasure for one himself to look at him and over again. And yes, it grows deeper into your heart, more often you look it. <br /> Summary: A love story, your character is crying, and really: a movie you've never forgotten! - Editor notes: well, I think I must watch it now again: D
