Vanilla Sky is a 2001 rumor of the 1997 Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) film. And in my opinion, a more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes the person's emotions for granted, and thinks only in himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friends. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanied her to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional friend's bed. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist David interview. All of the interactions, with the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky the most emotional, and the intricate stairs ever made. I will not explain yet in the draw, because it's far more compelling, less you know. Ignore everyone who calls this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The movie is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever done.
