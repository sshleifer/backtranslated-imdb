This is yet another di-it-like-it-is Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I'm not sure why she has this obsession for showing children mons *** ion and g * y concepts at the American filmy audience, but I get some of these really disgusting scenes! What's New It's a nice piece put together by Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter playing by leading lady of the famous movie, Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this movie different is, that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter reacts with or is friends and, like the halls, colleagues, film stars, models, the rich and others featured in Entertainment # 3 in his journal. <br /> <br /> Note: It is another good performance of Mrs Iyer. It is likely to be noted for this role. It performs selective but bright role in them. It is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment reporters are not supposed to justify people to cover, right? Deduction: Madhur came up with another good movie, which brings social problems to the stellar very nicely. However, this movie loses concentration and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich? or does he try to show us the life of an entertainment reporter who is living with REAL CRIME reporter's life? Is it trying to tell us how the government and the rich people rule over the press? or is it trying to illustrate the issues and abuse of children and g * y popular. Other concerts have included the written regulation that young women must sleep with principals or co-stars, if they want to enter Bollywood. In addition, she talks about how flight attendants become sick and tired of working after a short time and resort to extreme measures by getting married many elderly, etc. She also talked about happy women and children spoiled in wealthy families. be too complex for an average film film, who just wants to relieve some stress from the workday day
