Well here comes another, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all other movies in this genre, this is by far the best I've seen in a long time .. <br /> I'm going to admitted, the first time I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you've looked at a decent amount of movies , you'll know Sidney and Alison would be together in the and in the movie, one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> < Well, now this film is just made for Simon Pegg.I can not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a very weak film if not for Pegg's great performance. a huge number of gags and jokes in this film that kept me laughing really hard, courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie (I usually do not think of it as any more than one internally affiliated act, but it's really good at this one), then there are Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox that plays spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes ... great role for her ... <br /> <br /> All in all, while I usually do not agree with her ratings on IMDb, this time I would completely agree with they are ... <br /> Go and see this movie, it is really light-hearted and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
