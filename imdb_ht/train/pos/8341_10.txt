Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. This film accomplishes that every major movie strives to: create a world with time that we want to re-visit and make us happy to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this film is backing my mind and making me laugh (and that's always true after a lot of watch - always cool). All the actors in the upper form. The characters are so dead on them and their character's marks quite well as you forget the actor (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). Throwing in support is still brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a pack package total!"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physicists as "Greek choirs" - "but time does not exist"), Durning we can launch in NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (boss Robbins and co-workers at service stations), and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedians have Eisenhower ??). Do not miss this neglected treasure.
