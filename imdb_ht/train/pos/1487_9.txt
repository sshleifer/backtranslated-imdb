"Casomai" is a masterful story describing the story of a young couple who walked through the quiet waters of marriage. The story is very credible in telling the weird-see between oblivion and continuous interference by others, which is fairly typical of Italy (one may wonder if these are different from each other, though). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strongest points in the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is mild and inviting. And the face of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded. All in all, a really worthy movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year.
