The "Tenant" is the older movie of the Roman Polanski IMO. And I love "Chinatown," but this one is more original and original and outright creepy. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I showed this movie were * very disturbed * by it afterwards it must be prevented from affecting some people ways. Polanski has done a great job that is leading the lead in the "tenant" as well as directing it.
