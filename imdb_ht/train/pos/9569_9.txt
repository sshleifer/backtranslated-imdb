As I understand it, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous cat. 3 Hong Kong style movies disappear. At least until now, and what an amazing movie this one is. I knew it was a crime crime crime going on, but was the first cat. 3 I bought this recently, I was not sure what to expect. A Cambodian hit-man goes to Hong Kong to hit the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. Turning out, the judge arranged for the man to strike, because he divorced the judge, and threatened to take all his money. This is all known in the first ten minutes, so nothing has been given away. After the hit, the cops hit the man-hit very quickly, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians were killed. He eludes the police and now the race is about to catch the guy, before he returns to Cambodia. This is a movie that has never stopped, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. Yes, it's very violent and intense, many cops killed, such as hit the man proving very difficult to follow, and take down when found. Along the way, hit-in trying to hide in a dump, find a woman being raped and mistreated by some. She helped her and saved her from the guy, and she persuaded the hit-man to take him with him in his escape. I liked this movie, it's like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speeds, such an incident leads to another, and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man . The acting is exceptionally good, and the movie location and photography is in breathtaking moments. There is no let up in this movie, not even with the extremely incredible finish. The finish is pretty incredible, and also a tight end to all the action and violence. Yes, the violence is brutal at times, but this is a drama no crime nonsense, which will hit your socks. "Dogs Dog" definitely needs a more widespread release, including a R1 release for sure. Great movie, highly recommended.
