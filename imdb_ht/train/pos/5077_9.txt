Indian movies identify cops in two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. The honest players always call themselves in the voices and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most parties but suffer at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie at least breaks this formula usually and provides a refreshing view of cops and their lives. The director takes a look inside the life of a fast-paced cop. The exciting music and the correction is a trendy scene as far as American cinema goes. The movie is slow at times and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is overplayed at times. But I would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has so many of its credit.
