A very good start. I was somewhat surprised to find the car by quite so advanced: It should have been cruder, match we've seen in the original series. Throw is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too humane. She needs to be in school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they could not have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Madam Park, the Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has the possibility. Do not sort out the other boys, except for the black guy. It's a really favorable one. Bakula needs to find her niche - At QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. It is, of course, great and strong enough for the heroic. The heavies were OK, although I did not like their make-up.
