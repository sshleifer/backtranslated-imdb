This cinema life story and times at William Castle. He has made a series of top film films in the 1950s to 1960s that he sells and gimmicks. In "13 Zombies" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was at b & w). The "Tingler" had theater chairs equipped with a timer that had hit the audience when a monster rescued in a movie theater. "Reverend" gave a life insurance contract for all members of the feared fear of death! These films themselves were very bad but the gadgets had people rushing to see them. In this doc interview with director is inspired by Castle, actor in his cinema and his daughter. He also came to his home life and the type of person he was (not all he was a big guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely fixed. It's very short (under 90 minutes) and never a dull moment. A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans. One of my complaints - there were many sequences shown in his photographs. That's the place is just great.
