A great cops of the 90's! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the Manhattan nightlife that requires lots of cash. Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian with a night cramp. This is a good, light film for Saturday night before you go out. Rock in the band, teams out of this world, the script is funny and the actors are doing a great job. The buyer value: you can do it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the perfect actress for this type of character: young, fabulous and crushed. (You must watch the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at the party your girl is bound to have a good time. Enjoy!
