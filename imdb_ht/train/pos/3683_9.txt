18 directors had the same work: tell stories of love set in Paris. Of course, some of them have turned out to be better than others, but the whole tile is pretty spacious - besides, would not it be boring if they all had the same vision of love? Here's how I rank segments (which might change over a second look): <br /> <br /> 1. "Latin Quarter", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> One of the major French actors has ever been directed My favorite segment, featuring still the stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witty and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of the "Troubled Belleville") story of a boy whose parents are Mimo ; 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. "Park Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También", "Children of Men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (comic); <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touch); <br /> 6. "14th Arrest", Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt") wonderful look for the pathetic side of the present life here, feat. Margo Martindale's actress (Hilary Swank's mother of "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely, medium-aged American woman on vacation; "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run") frantic style works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love; 8. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious curse by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); "Loin du 16", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving stories from the talented Brazilian performers, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story feat. still fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne faithful (simple, but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Eliya Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> 15. Bastille, by Isabel Coixet (Fabulous director of the "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; "Pigalle", by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> 17. "Montmartre", by Bruno Podalydès; "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, and Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of "Barfly", "Reverse in Fortune" and "Single White Women"). <br /> I could rank some segments as brilliant as others (or even slightly boring), but not one of them is bad. In general, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" a 8.5 / 10 and recommend what it is: a nice tile about love and stuff in between.
