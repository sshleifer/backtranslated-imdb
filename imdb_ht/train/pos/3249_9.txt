Korbin Bernsen sends letters to his criminal associates who worked in the past and is an actual intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, and Ruben Blade. They will meet him in this dark city of Montana and he does not explain why because he was then picked up from the state police in New Jersey on a warrant. <br /> <br /> In the criminal group that gathered together, they all know Bernsen but do not know each other.
