By comparing what Brian De Palma has done in the 80's of what's happening for today's entertainment, her movie keeps looking better and better. "Dress to kill," Blow Out "," Double Body "," Scarface "and" Carlito's Way "are all wonderful works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his power. The guy has a long run at better than film average. This is the best Hitchcock with the 80 's dash in lurid perversion, an affectionate story of lust and murder with many twists, great help in style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, jealous-inspired geography. Camera-works and luscious, visual-blooded visuals help overcome the logic holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director of his own right), Nancy Allen (Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Caine performs every special scene. Let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, odassey packed erotic and you will enjoy every frame of "dressing to kill".
