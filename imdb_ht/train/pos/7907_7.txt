I could not agree less with the rating that gave this film, and I believe this is a sample of how much minded most of the spectators throughout the world. Really ... Do you forget that Cinema was used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment? This film is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hated it very much: because it does not try to be fun. It's just a story, a very strange I admit, but after all, it's just a strange story. It's not a big story, not even a great movie work, but I think it's worth a 7-star rating only for the courage of both authors and directors to shoot a story that has not been done in the audience, so sell Billions of copies and making the bigger even richer studios. This movie, for me, European-artistic film made in the US, and everyone involved in making it deserve respect. Be it for the courage, or for it for unique sense of humor.
