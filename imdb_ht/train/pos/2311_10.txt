Reese Witherspooon's first movie. Love it. The plot and the act were head teeth. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, a must see. <br /> After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> Other cast members are also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. There is a boring moment in the whole picture. The Man in Moon's length is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent. I've seen it many times, and have enjoyed all one of their looks.
