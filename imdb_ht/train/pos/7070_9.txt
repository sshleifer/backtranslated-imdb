One of the most appealing elements in a Gilliam film is that the visuals are well-concocted, the disturbing confrontations, and the frustrated manic characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where movies are some direct-to-hire directors featuring a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence in the experience. "12 monkeys" are proofs of Gilliam's own vision, as opposed to making movies cut for their own sake. "12 monkeys" is a variation of similar terms in Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / resourceful society, loneliness of the protagonist, frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel reign. In this movie Gilliam performs a fine job in the line of swirling between the two reigns, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than knowing. This tendency for Friuli neglected to fill in certain gaps leads to criticism of art-house pretensions. The difference between Jilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choice clearly has a purposeful and meaningful image. Two scenes almost identical to Cole in the beginning were meant to draw comparisons that left the audience unstable. Her bald head is a brand of world-renowned disease-ridden world, yet making it recognized in the world of 1996. The title itself is a feature of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story out In meat for its essence to be fully understood. All of Gilliam's dedication to the creative films that are interesting to look again also require the thought and interpretation of the audience. The movie is valuable to re-look, since there are subtle details and suggestions that can be missed on the first look. Definitely one of my favorites.
