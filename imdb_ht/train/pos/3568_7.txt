This film moves the Cinderella story forward in the early 1950's and makes good, though unique, the use of Isle of Man as a background. The ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class English girls, and along with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother are flounce over into various wonderful period costumes. The story is changed slightly in the traditional version: early on it is strange combine with the scheme of "King Lear", and in later stage Cinderella is rather more negative than is normal. It looks splendid and works on all the property well, but it goes to the top at times.
