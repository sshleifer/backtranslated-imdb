"The first shotgun must be 100% outsourced." Ackroyd's line tells it all. This is a hard to describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. He recalls once or twice at Dr. Strangelove, especially in the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job I think). I had no particular hope in this movie, though I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I just left the movie washing on me. And as a result I was well entertained. Saturian politics suffers from the fact that the US military-business complex is overwhelming. The sub-quantities were somewhat predictable, but the final half of story lines made them all worthwhile. I can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it is a timely story.
