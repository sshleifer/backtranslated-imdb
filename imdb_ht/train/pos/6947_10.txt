24 is the best TV show !!!!! It is an incredible TV set with an incredible suspension, excellent cemetery and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best proof. Because it's only the first episode, only the introduction, and you're hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent who assumes the protection of the senator David Palmer. He can not trust anybody because those CTUs can participate. And when this event occurred to her daughter: Kimberly escaped from home to a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to look more, and more, and more. <br /> It is only the first of the many, and it's excellent.
