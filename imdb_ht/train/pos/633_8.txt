Stardust Another Guard Review (originally written June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just just started for this one (no site yet? Wth?), So i doubt most in you heard about it. In truth, I was not either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when they're not working for me to enjoy it 100% as one deadly movie-goer . Turning out, he was not Transformers and I was aware of his way back when as 'Neil Gaiman movie'. What is it? Well, in short, it's a Fairy Tale Gaiman about a boy and a falling star. Any more than that and I should give away the plot info that is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) ruin your hobby. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. Rumor has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer. <br /> <br /> Do not know what to expect in a movie can be so wonderful if the surprise is refreshing. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not only critical film but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi / fantasy folks. So you know the audience hopes, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh how slowly I was. <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale written by a famed author in comic books. But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the ring wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than that. But as Lord of the Rings, he was, well, humanist in the film that sells the fabulous qualities. It's certainly a romantic story, but with generous flying in humor. And this humor is in the sort that is not shrekism slapstick. Read more about the lines of dramatic comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review review. <br /> <br /> Actress is, at least in many, good. It's still hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I think there was significant superb role to play. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of these people. He plays a cruel and does the job. There is nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, was a big jerk. That is, a big villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - that's wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly thrown and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to have too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who) as the lead character was beautiful surprise from a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I was always in mixed mix with him. It can be great, and then it may seem to miss the brand. In that, it is the former. And he is, quite literally, the star of this movie. Be sure, its accent stumbled here and there. And yes, it's not as good as it can when Cox is not in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The special effects are muted yet fulfilled, and only significant location should be. Best pirate flying again - sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and nicely shed. Report cards could be best, but not all films in New Zealand. Everything else is top bracket. <br /> And now that's done ... <br /> <br /> ... write. Oh, write it! Neil, or devil. It's hard at climate today to do anything original and, first, you start asking. A kingdom, a dead king, a boy from proving his own value, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you to the surface with abomination only to subsidize it all in a sweet tale of a boy with his heart. And, even if you suspect how it's all gone in turn out, you begin to wonder the third act and - if you're me - find yourself pulling in the climactic climactic confrontation and hope for the better. In the end, you will find this story, this movie, that all fairy tale would be but all too often not. Awesome and real. <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs. Tristan but I will not ruin it for you .. For those who read the book, rest assured, it does well.) </ b> <br /> I talked and then had the same impression I did. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, with the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The word becomes full-in only after the movie is wide wide because, well, you might expect it. You will know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust does not get lost in the tent. Even if it does, it will be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> <br /> Forget adding {delivery} to reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages to enjoy, with new BRIDE at PRINCESS for this generation." <br /> <br /> Maybe somewhat high an evaluation but I still have confidence that years of form now, there will be even "Oh, I love that movie," this answer as there is now for the Princess Bride.
