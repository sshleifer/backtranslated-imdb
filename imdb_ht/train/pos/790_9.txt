Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexual in that role than any male porn star, though she holds her pants on. The movie torn in my heart reminds me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I do not think I can think of another movie, except perhaps the Romeo Zeffirelli and Juliet that captured the joyful joy. <br /> <br /> The other plot of the movie is the many English characters to enjoy the vicariously scandal. In this regard, it is very much appealing as Midsomer murder or a Miss Marple mystery, without the destruction. <br /> This is a great antidote of the mock horror now popular in the USA a relationship between people of different ages.
