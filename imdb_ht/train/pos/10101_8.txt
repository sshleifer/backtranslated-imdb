Domination of police tanks is an exercise of contradiction film. The scenario through 4 parts mixes mindless actions, humor stick-sticks, touches humanity and thoughts to induce philosophical questions. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style of episode episode change. A must-see movie for anyone who loves anime.
