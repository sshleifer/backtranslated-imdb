This movie is Jackie's best. I still cant get enough of watching some of her best exhibitions at all times. I also love the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some of Jackie's other works, this movie has also been a great storyline and I recommend it to all of Jackie's fans.
