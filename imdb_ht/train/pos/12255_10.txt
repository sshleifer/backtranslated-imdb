In Austen movie spin from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than "Persuasion," which was the one that converted me into Austeniana. Before seeing this "Emma" I saw two previous versions, but in one Emma seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other it seemed half wrong, as a possible impostor, When We consider it just right, young and funny and stubborn. In general I thought the mood and the atmosphere of the production transmitted the charm of the novel very well; indeed it is one of the sweetest things, merriest I've ever seen, instead of the nature of a Christmas treat. The script is very well-formed, with the adaptation adaptation, like the shaft of light that reveals Harriet Emma in church, are all in keeping. Strong brands as Knightley is not what I would expect, but I enjoyed it very much: it strongly carries out plain-spoken, side-by-side characters, in contrast to Emma's affection, and her crurian against Frank Churchill are well funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of nearly Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's Protector is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as it should be. And as in the same producers' "Pride and prejudice," care taken that the connections can eventually be in the characters they can believe - uniquely in some cases. For me this production was and it remained a pleasure.
