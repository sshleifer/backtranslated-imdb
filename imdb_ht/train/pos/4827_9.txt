That's why the historical / biography of the movies is so important to all of us, in addition when they did well, like this one! <br /> <br /> Before I saw the "Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got more knowledge about it. Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as Victoria (Who would guess that!) and It's probably going to get a nomination in this Oscar year. Personally, I'm excited for it .. <br /> For technical issues, I'm happy to say that is a very successful production, and wonderful Art Direction / Decoration Decoration and, of course, as He hoped to be, a terrific design Costume Periodic! The one disadvantage is that I want to see more and know more about this exciting queen, but first, incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
