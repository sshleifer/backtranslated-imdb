How the Grinch stole Christmas immediately stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first look. Now eight look later, she still has the same impact on me as she did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters Jeffery Pri & Peter S. Seaman in that framed Roger Rabbit fame made a fantastic job to adapt the story of Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story into complete life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as the Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some opponents of the movie have claimed it is not true of the spirit or principle of original story. Having read the original story, I must say I can not agree. The movie makes the very same point on Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it improves the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why Grinch has become what it was. <br /> <br /> * thousands SPOILERS * (They probably would not ruin the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it again, and you are the one who wants to know NO on a story until you See it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's awful experience at school. I think that all of us, at one time or another, were one of the most popular in the school that has always taken on. I know I was ... and that's why I personally had a lot of sympathy for Grinch and what she went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all wrong, heart was sorted. When everyone else turned their back on the Grinch from fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could have made the movie a little better would have to more tune down the adult humor and content. It has already been very immobile, but any of this adult humor (like Grinch's air was nailed to the first whitney's mite) just does not fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> This one good on its way to a classic Christmas, takes a well-deserved place along with the book and the design of Chuck Jones as a must-see in every Christmas season.
