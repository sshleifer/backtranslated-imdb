THE RUNNING MAN, AND TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite movie Schwarzenegger. No, this is not 2001, but it does not mean to be. And acting with script here is not even up to par with other Arnie movies like PREDATOR or the Terminator. But I submit that the IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A sponsored game show that criminals are convicted of serious crimes against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (runners equipped with none) in order to meet the public lobby for sports and blood. The ultimate prize for a runner has: freedom. Or so the rules claim. <br /> For a movie with such over-the-top-gory scenes and one-piece cheesy scenes, it really has a lot to say. Another person said all commentary on culture / government presented in this movie, so I will not go into it here. Try to say that if you can look beyond feeling funny in the movie, you'll enjoy it very much (especially if you're a great fan of SF and a lot of imagination). As I said, he is not trying to make a serious art film, but it is surprisingly coated for a 80s shoot-em-up flicker movie. The quote is borrowed from a Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King) short woman, but diverse justice strongly comes from its source material, especially towards the end. (The book ends rather nihilistically; useless to say this movie.) I enjoyed both, but I love the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Guess it's caused by steroids."
