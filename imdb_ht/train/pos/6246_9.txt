It's not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you're 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be seriously tested and this movie does not matter how smooth you are. I told Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment movie, so the majority of viewers would not have the level of "maturity" to reach its delightful side. Types like Tarkovsky movie, but different in one way. I, myself, can not say I was very pleased to watch it. But it is an exceptional and very exciting experience for those who are suffering only by the clich√© that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratch your head all over. You can not simply sit back and watch it, you will be using slaps or looking with wide open eyes all over the movie. A movie that's similar to this style is Nachtgestalten, but it has been considerably better, with less violent ways. This one for example, is not for children or mentally sensitive or over-tempered people. Most viewers would be more likely to give either a 10 or a 1 in this movie. I give it a 9 because I've seen multiple-story-in-a-movie phenomena in another movie and it was best. But this one in an exceptional piece on its own. Worth watching, but getting ready to see something disturbing.
