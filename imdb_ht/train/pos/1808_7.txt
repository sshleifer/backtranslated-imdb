All dogs go to heaven is a kid animated film like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all important in the draw, and even if the kids will get lots of it, the adults will scratch their heads as to why this movie has felt like some sort of gangster movie . The actual movie is not explicit in any way, it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog, who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After drinking (A dog ... getting drunk ... in a kid's movie. It's just strange sounding.), Charlie is deceived and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be in heaven. He always goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), with payback plans on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has an orphan girl Anne Marie who was born captivating because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps predict race. Charlie and Itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while learning a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both children and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and animation alive, while adults will enjoy the beautiful, sweet drawn, and more than the usual characters developed. One thing that keeps this down, is that it's a music. Normally, this is a good thing, but the music here is awfully awesome. They tend to fly around, almost sounding free ad, and next to no instrumental backing. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard of an animated movie, but luckily, the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart because of some bad notes. in this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad, but happy but more sad than happy and make the movie feel like it needs an end. Considering how bad the end of this was, I wish the finish would not have justified an end and would have wrapped up in a nice, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel this way on, but I do. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a beautiful family movie, with odd themes thrown in, but, however, good entertainment. <br /> My Rating: *** from ****. 85 min. G.
