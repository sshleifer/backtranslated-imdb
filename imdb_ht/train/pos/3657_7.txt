This film is like a 1950-version of Ettore Scola's Brutti Sporchi et cattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a great history of humanity and heat. I would not call this a neo-realistic picture. It's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be considered a comedy, although it deals with serious matters (a little like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). Typical Italian though, very emotional, and hard to resist except for a cold stone person. Sentimentalism is a disappointment, although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or the boot robber. But it is an enjoyable comedy and hilarious, and good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
