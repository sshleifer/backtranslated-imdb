While thinking of the "Great Escape" I allow my mind to wander back to this little little in a movie from my childhood. I read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949 that inspired him, and when he came to the cinema only (we never used that word then actually) in town that showed "alien" movie, i was the first line to buy my ticket. As someone brought on warreimes and propaganda films during WWII, I had a hungry interest in exploring the realities of the conflicts that reflected in the memories and stories of people who were in person. It extends later on a willingness to earn over the years to buy any books on the subject, and eventually read the novels equally compelling of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, who gave a even deeper meaning. The movie versions, however, were unlike this one in which they rarely deliver their goods. The medium of black-and-white films never served as well as in those years. I have never seen any version versions of similar wars as authentic as making the deep chiaroscuros of films such as "Wooden Horse." If it is true that we are still destined to be prisoners of the images of our childhood, then I confess it free. <br /> And there will never be another love of Leo Genius as emblem hero of British war on film. Not even Sir Alec.
