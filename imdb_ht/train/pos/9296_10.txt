I like this movie. It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out of a crazy top, and definitely not your usual comedy. <br /> If you do not get the fun movie then I guess it's just not for your taste, so this is one hard to write a review for .. For reference, some other comedy I love are Big Lebowski Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one only got me a second time around). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the weird, and I want to accept that most people just do not tend to like this kind of stuff. I do not apologize for having a strange sense of humor - at least I have one. Scenes and characters of this particular film are well put together, the hilarious verbal humor, the situations are intriguing, Acting is very good (as you would expect from the cast), even if the demands of the act are performed at the cast by script there are not particularly high. The overall package makes for fun, funny, entertainable yet violent entertainment.
