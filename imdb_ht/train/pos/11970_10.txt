Full House came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing re-running in America's America Goggle and Bob Saget, and one day my mom told me that she was also in a full-featured show . One day I was lucky enough to hold an episode while visiting the family. It does not seem too exciting at first, but as I watched more and more, ever night at 9:00, I would just be so in it. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be yourself, hang out with the girls, go with them, and maybe even join their little "sing-along" family. <br /> The thing I like most about Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. It will have some more adult parts, then the party means for the kids, so that the whole family will enjoy it. No matter how cheese it can, it's still a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
