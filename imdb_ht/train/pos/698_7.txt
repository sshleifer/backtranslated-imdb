I saw this movie shortly back, after ordering it for my friends, who is a big fan of Dominik Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, though it had its positive point, which for me was the kind of Donnie Darko in "wtf?" Factor after the movie ended. <br /> Of course, and positive also comes negative. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job as well. Unfortunately I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. This might just be me, and I do not claim to be a serious criticism, in the way that I do not get enough skilled, but it just did not seem to convince as an actor. But maybe it even more hit then so although I'm not a critic, this gets my attention. <br /> <br /> To conclude, on all I think it's definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it.
