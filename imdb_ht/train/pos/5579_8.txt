I have never heard of this movie until I came across it by accident when browsing IMDB. I saw it had many terrible reviews with very colorful explosives on how much it stunk. Of course this meant I was seeing it. I was pleasantly surprised as whipping is actually rather a good movie. I watched her with a group of friends and we laughed very much at that we had so many comedies that had many students for Hollywood. This is an independent film and as such shows its subjects (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood watchman. I clearly suspect that the opinion of this film will depend extensively on the experiences of life. If you never date or much party you will not find this movie because you will not have to meet people like these characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations described here in funny fashion. The finish was also good, as it did not show women as real, discouraged, romantic virginity in dealing with many Hollywood movies.
