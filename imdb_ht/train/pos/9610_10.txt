I called my heart out, watching this movie. I never suffered from any food disorders, but I think this must be a very true picture. <br /> Alison Lohman is excellent! He expresses these feelings amazingly well. My teenage teen turned to me so clear. Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie. I recommend you all to see it! <br /> <br /> The music is great too - I've now discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> I am also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Olanander, because I'm positive it is perfectly suited for the role as Agnes.
