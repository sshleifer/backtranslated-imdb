I went to Chesapeake camp. He sat at the top of the Chesapeake Bay on the North River in MD. It was a summer camp similar to cabins. It was established by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young campus and later became a Junior, Senior Advisor and later, the Waterfront Director. If the camp continued, I would do anything in my power to be the director of the camp. Ala power at the YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp some years later by boat and feared by the state negligence of MD and natural destruction by mother nature. The 350 site has many benefits and benefits in contact with nature offerings. A black man by the name of Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and caretakers of the property. Mr Curtis was my friend and adviser. I had to idolize each of them. Just as he could not swim he was a waterman. If I asked her where the fish was bitten, she would designate the place, and I would have a ball. It was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me for eternity.
