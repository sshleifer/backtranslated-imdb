This one's chalk got into the winning column, this was a superb movie. Their acting performance was great and the script was equally great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was magnificent as Gina Pulasky's Riverside Police officer. Gina was a complex character. He was a rookie cop and the Riverside Police Dept. He ended up in an affair with a work colleague that he knew had a wife and children, all while taking on the dangerous task of going to civilians to catch a serial killer. Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looked alike) made a bang up work as confused, often stammering, police officer who had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was quite opposed when he came to deal with his feelings and his extra-marital affairs. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, most notably from the Sitcom "Wings", has done a great job as a quiet, gentle, underachieving sociopath. On the surface, it was an innocent loser, but under the surface was lying an intense cold assassin. Weber really took over the character of a young child with an insatiable thirst to kill young. <br /> <br /> The movie all was spectacular. Each stage, each verbal exchange tells us more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal work with condensation days, if not weekly worth of events in a 90 minute movie. This movie was a great example of doing so much and little.
