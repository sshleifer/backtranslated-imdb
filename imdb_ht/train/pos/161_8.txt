This funny movie is really fun for the younger audiences. Heros are a couple of Dude detective whose sophomoric atmosphere leads them down very funny. Chasing the case of great murder, you will see these detectives go through each length to solve the crime. There's no stripping, but lots of sexual implications, slapstick silliness ... all the teens go for. Low budget, but very fun. Defines Potential Potential.
