Fire and Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier that is the home of the evil ice meter named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to avenge those killed by the glacier. Glaze the ice to the land of fire and the princess of the land named Teegra kidnapped by all evil creatures. Larn sets out to get it and also sets out to find and kill Nekron. Fire and ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi who is one of my favorite adult animators. He has led us as anime masterpiece as the movie version of Fritz Cat and some films he wrote himself, such as the big movie of heavy traffic. I did not like fire and ice almost as much as I have Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still get the movie to be enjoyable. It has some very nice animation in parts and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaints I have is that I hope there has been more of a story in the movie because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much of it. I wish also the movie was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes of running time. Always read in an entertaining action movie movie that contrasts with Fritz Cat or Heavy Traffic that is appropriate for children 8 or older. I only wanted to have a more developed history and it went a bit longer than it did.
