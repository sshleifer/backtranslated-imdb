The Blob is a 1950 classic B-movie sci-fi filmmaker. You probably know the story: two teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) saw a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man and some strange ... his arms. They take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, the spread of patties, feeding everyone in its path. Special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. There are a lot of great touches, as the cop who plays chess on the radio and a cop to another district. He has no masterpiece, but he has a special place in his genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
