The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had their desire to become a popular group of girls. In the initiatives, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Saturn, who Sister goes after because he believes it is "the great time" that will give everything he ever thinks he wants out of life. Even though she could accuse her of killing her, she really killed her only spirit and she would live, after which she became a drug addict and finally died from an overdose. The story is not about the life of the street or the Italian mobster who attempts to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedy of life as described by song and style with the character which was the life of the times for young women trying to "discover" back then.
