An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern takes great pain in search and writing documents and pays. He is not afraid to tell the truth, though he might shoot favorable reviews and comments to some people who love stories to be clean and sweet and brighter. Again, McGovern brings to Christopher Eccleston, but not as high as a profile as he plays in Hillsborough. I found this movie as accurate, well-acting and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for writing his unapologetic writing. Well done and my hat is from the writer, the actors, the production crew. A great movie!
