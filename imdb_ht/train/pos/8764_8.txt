Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) were the best friends ever and after graduating they decided to take a trip to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a young person who attracts mysterious guests who are invited to go with Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene make mistakes for drug smuggling heroines and sent to prison. Now it's time to survive ultimate and true friendship. This was a very good movie, I saw it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes has done a great job as usual, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
