A first-time director (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world in a medium-aged, middle-class, depressed hit-man and his struggling with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast to human nature. David Dorfman as 6 year old son William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a moment. Macy is brilliant at a party that looks almost like her for a top torture struggle to break the kidneys of her dad and her business. It's still great to see Donald Sutherland and here it's wonderful like the magic father of Macy. The alternate audio tracks are well worth the hearing the director explains how he chose the cast, place, and filmed the movie. The basic dolby 2 sound channel is adequate for this movie and well recorded. Cinematography creates the mood with a very subtle music background. Any movie film or observer in human nature will enjoy this one especially if it is a contradiction fan.
