This is a movie I never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it in the video store and grabbed it after the picture's sympathy covered in the animals on Nabooboo Island. We got it and looked it repeated since; In fact we have rented it several times since. There are very few movies that are not animated by my son watching and paying attention; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The act is exceptional, the songs are compelling, they find deep in mind and you can not help but sing along. The scenario, while especially on WW2 is timeless in its own way and having something new to see every time you look. I've heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think that two movies are very different, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in all of Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that children are willing to look over and over again with one that parents will not mind to comply with them. There are days we watch it before bedtime and bed time and I do not feel that the plain comes when she wants to repeat any other movie.
