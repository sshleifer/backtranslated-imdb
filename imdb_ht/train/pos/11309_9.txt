A master's treatment of James Caine in the "Rings Still Rings twice" as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a Sally war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought to be destroyed but Visconti saved a printing and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. A beautiful magician of Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently had her breasts in La Cena delle beffe "(1941), stars as the ring-filled and ill-hate lovers who plotted to kill her husband. crime does not pay, one pays in a way that is not directly linked to the crime .. Excellent direction, script, act, and cinematography. Reportedly not as good as the French "Le Dernier tournant" (1939), but probably better than The US version (1946) featured Lana Turner and John Garfield in the leading role.
