This is a bizarre look at Al Life, back when it's still an ultra 20-something. Really home videos of Al as a kid are great, with the comment from (real life) parents give a nice glimpse into just how Weird Al wound up like screwing up as it is. This video is a must owned for any dedicated Al-koholic.
