It was a bit scarred and wrong and I enjoyed it very much, the characters in the show were great as well, and complimenting each other well. I was sorry to see it off ... I would like to see where he could go. You have found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who was more secret than anyone. Lucas was frightened and tired. And I would like to see more of him, and how his character came. I'll however buy the show just to enjoy, it's great at something different on TV. With Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin, it was a great mystery as where and what it means to Lucas. It's a shame it's not around yet .. or never end, I'd like to see what would happen.
