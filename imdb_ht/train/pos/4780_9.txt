Always fancied this movie from the video cover. Eventually got round to buy it for a fiver in a stomach and boy that is a movie. A simply stunning performance throughout the case and filmed it so well. Even at times from a distance you can barely hear that the dialogue is, as if you really are away from picking up bits in the story. It really moves, often fun and very watchful. Not many dialogues but are filmed in such a way that you feel a lot of holes. A 9/10 from me. A must see.
