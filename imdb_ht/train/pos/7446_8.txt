I can not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the movie on a UK TV channel, it was presented as an independent movie and if you took the movie under that angle I think it's a different thing. I could not believe what I saw and was kicked off immediately. The plot can be as bad as an JS's show (meaning no scheme) but the act is cruel, it's hilarious and it's all in an incredible movie waste. <br /> It says much about America than a Bully or Ken Park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse of the American society, and more precisely on what TV afternoon in America (and I think it's a lot of them!) who are interested in. After all, in the neighbors we are talking about, are not we? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
