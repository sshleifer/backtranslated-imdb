Primarily it is the story of two people who belonged to the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually the director starts out of a historical fact to talk about something else, or also shows the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during the day's day when the revolution acts . It might also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focused on these two people, which shows as normal they were, not as common heroes, because the revolution comes from humans. Although it was made out of the military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capita" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and light during the entire movie, excellent work for the director of his first movie, he does not fall in the banal way. Well shows emotions and passions in people and crowds. The character of Maia (primary one) is well-designed and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, able to show Maia's limit, this was not a hero.
