The actors play beautifully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It is good that Robin Williams has received the role of comedy in Oirik, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It is really great that Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text, this is definitely not too often ... Thanks to that viewers can see the whole, not the chosen - by the director - party. Also - thank God that the movie is in a classic form; NON fan surrealist! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was incredibly impressive, but still Hamlet is a different story, at least this is my point of view.
