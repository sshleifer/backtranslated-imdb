Natalia Emily Watson is absolutely the most favorite and romantic lead I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this movie beyond all doubt. Or, is it transmitted to the king? The international weaving of the chess games and the family struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. As the master chess of the movie does, the director plays many simultaneous games with our mind once, but all tied to either big or minor models. The period, costumes, and imagery of the early 20th century Italy's captive enchanting. Not one square in space is wasted. <br /> So many bright scenes are great, I can not recall them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, perhaps a week apart, because you can not possibly take all the poetry in a 64-square-quadrant yet multi-dimensional setting in one setting. I did not read the book Nabakov but tried an analogy of my own, what I read reminded me of another romantic poetry-like-toy trio, the Barry Levinson Natural. It totally jettisoned the downbeat's fate of Bernard Malamud's fatalist book in favor of a romantic impression that was uniquely American. Well, the director did this one better by noisy Russian and Italian mayhem and Mum like a series of Enlightenment. The true story here is that the games are zero-sum; There is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors draw. But in life, especially in the context of our immortal soul, we are limited only by these constraints and conventions of life within our limits to let others break our spirits. <br /> <br /> The favorite, as personalized by Natalia Emily Watson, can be over and allow us all to be strengthened by his gift together. Only the barriers built by our fears can cut us off from it. This is a magnificent movie (10/10).
