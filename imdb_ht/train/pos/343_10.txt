Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me to. Gorgeous, talented and popular, these are the performers watch out for .. Ok, where I start. We already know that the movie is over. Five beautiful girls were targeted by a 'romantic' slasher series, a guy all turning away from the dance school 13 years ago. Its brands include subtle disguised deaththreats such as valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolate with a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, take a pick - ax, knife, electric powerdrill, bow and arrow, hot, etc. Ok, so basically it's a horror movie and a great sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Movie films are not supposed to be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I worship. It's up with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer mask is infamous infamous, and seeing Cupid shooting a bow and arrow in a victim is really churning. The act is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun. I really wanted to see so much, much more to Katherine Heigl. I'm one of her biggest fans and would like to see her do some leading job soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffiel gets the role of this blonde ditzys she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The younger parts are also good; Hedy Buress was a joke ('bleedmedry.com') and that the youngest version of Denise Richards looked frightfully like her. <br /> <br /> Featured: Every scene of death has a particular distinction in it. The Creepiest was the opening stage of the morgue. The hottub scene, while ludikrous, was well done. And the audiovisual lab was disaster. The soundtrack is great, with climbing music and some fine tunes. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt as if the killer was not featured enough, we barely saw the mask, and it was not at all the highest point. I also thought the climax was really disoriented, but fun though. <br /> The sad end to the end was not great a surprise, but I'm really happy that the filmmakers decided to supply us all I do not like to tell the movie people should see, but if someone asked me to choose a movie horror that I thought was really worth seeing, then Valentine should read. <br /> Rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
