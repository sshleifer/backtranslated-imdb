I wish children movies always went that way; dark and deep. There was (to find this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character), drawing drawings, superb animation, emotional involvement, and a rational, relatable, and consistent theme. If not for a few routines and dance, you would never think this was a movie of kids, and that's why I give it a high rating. This film is an excellent movie, let alone for a child's movie. Which brings me to my second point: this was to be the most "children" movie "The movie I've seen in some time, this comes out of a 22-year-old. I should be shocked to see any kids under age 8 is not completely frightened during a great deal of half of letters and some in the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the protracted endings you could ever come across ("Jape Jurassic" for those of you who are fan 'Futurama'), and this is what makes this movie so good. Just because the film universal recalls emotions does not normally like to feel and assume the bad by making the movie itself bad; in fact This means that it is successful. Funny films are supposed to make us laugh; good movie horrors are supposed to be frightening; good sad movies are supposed to be sad. My point is, good movies are supposed to be your moves, do not simply entertain; This movie has moved me. <br /> Also, this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for a child's film and has subjects that, today's standards, may not be suitable for some Children, Parents, I'd say it's the first. I'm not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing, but I just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise to me.
