This is a haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Postman's Still Ring twice led by the great Luchino Visconti. What's interesting about the movie is that in every way it transcends it from source material to become something intrepid and more original (also interesting Camus's Cain novel credits as the key inspiration for Stranger's landmark novel). The film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the chemical equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex exploration of gender. Many Americans Cain's novel is also uncritically captured and the construction of blightness (Cora of lead obsessively feared character will be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed by married a Greek immigrant), which is not related to the Italian rural context that Visconti is working inches This allows the antagonisms of the classes to capture scene scenes and dance among the tenants of the love, convicted, two main characters. This film is a complex, thrilling, rewarding experience.
