David Lynch's new stabbing is a very thin, tiny, tense, silent, but very tight, but highly stressed piece of music, with features of beautiful actresses, a blond and a brunette, a recurring theme in her work. > <br /> Both characters create a very excited slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same type of relationship featured in Mulholland. <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
