I saw this series when it was world premier at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where the two men joined and told a director in each country to lead a movie about 911. These directors never met until the project was completed, and saw how it look all together. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful, and some were controversial. If you are an American, then you may not like this as some of the pieces can be found anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who have enjoyed these series. The piece that I found best was one in India. It was about how a Muslim family, living in the United States, had 2 sons, and one of them was missing. The Americans were given the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that it was linked to the terrorist bomb. It captures mother's despair and humiliation of such accusations well, that she brings tears to my eyes. At the end we see that his son died while trying to save the many victims of the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that made it so real. There was a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. He was still as powerful as the others. A must see for everyone, and America hopes to pull off this, and let it play in their own country.
