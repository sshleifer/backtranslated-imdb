This is a drug document covering no new ground, reworks all the clicks and is sloppy with reality. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it bumpy in the movie? For example, at the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but a armistice. But it is announced as a surrender. For example, European news vendors did not (and not) call titles like their eagle papers. But this American custom is strictly employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt German eagles until after they had taken power, but there it was on the reader as Hitler delivered one of his stepfather's steamers. Indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory. The film also perpetuated the myth of the pocket beer pulp bar at the Minister of the Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a fine painting of his subject. But casting his support is adequate at best and very often not even that. These reviews are based on the first episode only. One only can expect that the second will be better, but do not bet on it.
