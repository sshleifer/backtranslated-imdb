I liked it, having a fan of the original series, I was always wondering what the story would be back - it did not fail to have fun. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I did not recognize one person - this is refreshing, much like BSG. He introduced me to a wealth of new talent - can not wait for the series to start waves. Well done Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent work. Special effects, dialogue and acting were all over, and I felt emotionally tied to the storyline. I know there are purists out there who will probably agree with my evaluation, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi things that were produced in the last decade.
