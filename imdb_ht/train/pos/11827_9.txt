If Dick Tracy was in black and white, the papacy would not be religious. Giving a new sense of concept to color in a movie, we offer a unique experience throughout a comic-strip world, and it's one of the few movies that is in place to do this, thanks to a serious script, good direction, performance great (Al Pacino is amazing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, artistic design and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we've seen before. And there is also a very successful homage of all genre of gangster-movie, practice disappears in modern movies. In general, I see this film as a cool attempt with a touch of originality in a movie that renders more and more on the old and already seen mechanisms. 7 out of 10.
