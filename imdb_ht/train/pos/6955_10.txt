My super M-X girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the costumes were Uma Thurman put in bubble bubba. Uma Thurman is a comic actress actress but has proven to all who is wrong and nailed her role as the girlfriend to dig. It was just simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also good Joe's average but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. Throw in support was also superb especially Anna Faris was very good (A lot better than in the scary film franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did very well in directing this movie because if he did not for him and Uma Thurman this movie would not do that well. This film is clearly a 10/10 for her to cast (Uma Thurman), her director, her movies and from her original line to draw. This movie is highly recommended.
