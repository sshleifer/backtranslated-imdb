While "Kiss of the Woman Spider" cast Raul Julia as a political prisoner in a country identified Latin America, this time he is working for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. Specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so Julia replaced the president with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) firing a movie in the country. From there, Dreyfuss had to know how to be a dictator, all while swinging it with his own life. Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation into Latin American comedies? Well, "The Moon Over Parador" does a great job with it. No matter what they do in this movie they pulled it. She just goes to show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors in our day, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also begins Sonia Braga (who co-stars with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> I agree: the first lady is warm.
