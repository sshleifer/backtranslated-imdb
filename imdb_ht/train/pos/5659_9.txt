AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare American television. Sheriff Lucas gave a lot of their wishes to viewers. We were rooted in Caleb while it was contrary to resistance to Sheriff Lucas. We have become engrossed with fear of learning about the harmful connection between these two characters. The weekly manipulations gave the reasons why Lucas would do their best to be surprised. This show has lived up to the "Gothic" moniker in the way American entertainment has so rarely tried, much less mastery. Costumes have definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame on the current show of "reality" - which is less than satisfying. It calls for a DVD-based DVD set of assets. Show this quality look for a starving discerning market for quality look. A tired public on saturation of mind-numbing reality ticket prices will welcome this gem into real-story stories. Bring on the DVD set box!
