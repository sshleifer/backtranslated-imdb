This is a very rare example of a film about transvestitism (heterosexual). The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general hearing does not know of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and should not forget for this brilliant act. The director of Christopher Monger's very sensitivity, treated as a very tough problem, is loaded into a good story. Not a big movie, nor an "art" movie, but a little, beautiful photo shoot!
