"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderful thought out movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched the movie late one night, excited about what was coming. I was not disappointed. At the end of the film, I was astringent. I could not find it in my mind. The whole idea of ​​it just blows me away. The finish was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot was also something that kept me interesting in and through. Throw, superb. It was an all around nice movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie that keeps you interested forever.
