This movie will move without sentimental - sense without pretensions. It tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as technology encounters with an advanced society makes the family business running increasingly discouraging. The act is wonderful - though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors, we should have long ago - to play the characters with honesty and reverence - these are defective characters , each with the greatest weakness, but with these utterly humane and humane concepts, it is impossible to engage in the story. <br /> We need more films like this - we need more western creators to create films like this.
