BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie. David Zucker managed to make us all laugh ourselves again, in a really unusual, but many times intelligent, comedy. <br /> <br /> 2 creators of South Park, the main actors in this movie, play very good, surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The movie often reminds me of South Park - one of my fav shows. <br /> It's a really good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
