This movie makes a strong comment on Italian people in the allotted time. The use of mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is beautiful and I can not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. The ways of communicating are so beautiful and natural that you can wonder whether the camera is actually there. The husband, in his short role, is also excellent as the Italian fascist who orders his wife and children, but in his own way, a loving father. The beginning scene with Hitler in Venice Venice and all Italians are unbelievable and really the movie is historically. I liked the movie and I agree that it is funny it's not more renowned.
