Recently I've seen this film in my international business class. I did not wait anymore then another boring documentary (does not mean I do not like documentary I was just tough bad luck and movies in this class) Imagine my surprise when this movie is what is actually a movie , came. <br /> <br /> This movie is a telling all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to cooperate to find anywhere. The culture conflict shows just how different the world is and just how different we see ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a call up. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh, because yes it is funny. <br /> Well, that's about it! Cheers
