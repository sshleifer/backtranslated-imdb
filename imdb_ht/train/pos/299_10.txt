Peter Bogdonavich did a handful of films really great, and they all betrayed one of his best. The cast could not be better equipped to play this light, but a bit bittersweet comedy vicious. Interestingly enough, the spirit, light earning Bogdonavich so effortless staff gives the film a rather embarrassing core. Cool and immediate, the movie begins with absolutely no explanation. There is no soundtrack music in our cue. We encountered the characters in action, and as Bogdonavich slipped down the streets of New York, the film unfolding effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures it all with a clear simplicity similar to crash, but surely it is not. Throw is terrific. In any way, a classic.
