I saw this first movie in my play & kouwrwrights in Tulane. I was awed at how beautiful and raw documentary was. It is a sincere look at the reality blameless in a lifetime of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought she really showed Little Edie to her core. ** As a note by my teacher even told me that in all the filming, Little Edie became infamous with one of the camera people. ** The beauty I get, from the natural to family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mothers and daughters who can not function independently in society alone and begin to wish for Little Edie's rehabilitation in society. In all, the movie is suited to its aesthetic quality and it's painted in surprising beauty. Two thumbs way up!
