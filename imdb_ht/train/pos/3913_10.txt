Carmen Carlos Saura is one of the finest achievements in the world, let alone Spanish, movies. He manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful scene adaptation from Bizet with powerful physical force. At the same time we see the impact of the creation and repetition of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and dancer principles. Fine lines between life and art are dazzling.
