This film was made just a few years later, I would knock down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor. Sometimes, the film appeared a silent film during the scene-between-scenes (normal sounds are missing). But giving it to 1931 with a French movie, this is well forgiven. Especially since this also came in later French films - by which time the sounds of difficulty should be worked out completely (as in L'Atalante from 1934). Okay, apart from some minor sound issues, this is a nice little movie about a missing lottery ticket missing and a long list of people trying to find it. And, during the search there are plenty of chic little songs that you can not help but love. A good good movie all-in-all.
