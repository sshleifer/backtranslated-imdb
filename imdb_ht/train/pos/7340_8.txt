This animation has a very simple and straightforward against evil plot and is all about action. What sets it apart from other animations is how the human moves are animated. She was really nice to see the woman fleeing running around on the screen from the left to right and look around, her movements did so well. Why does not this rotoskowik technique use these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric setting and little dresses women, have clearly been devoted to showing the beautiful girl in distress in various sexy ways, her strange body serves as best eyecandy. Some may hate this and consider it as yet another moron to sexual fantasies, others (including many women) are worshiping their aesthetics. I sure did not mind! Bakshi just likes anime lushious, gradually, as well as can be seen in fresh world, and I do not think he has apolige because it's pretty much animated adult. But I also loved this animation as a child and I never forgot it. <br /> This one was just special, so different from Disney's standards or Anime fare, and for this reason alone is well worth the look when possible Bakshi's finest. For those who love animation and lushious women: try Cobra space adventure too. <br /> I give fire and ice 8 out of 10.
