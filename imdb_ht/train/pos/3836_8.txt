Very interesting and intriguing movie. The similarities of David Lynch (who even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the movie) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the home keeper of this film called Ms. Grubach, as is one of Der Prozess. ..) are well presented but in this case they are accompanied by clear references to the past colonial of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the movie I can not describe clearly: this colonial is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are a central problem as well, and demand for social contacts and love. These are symbolic terms I deduced from the movie, but in fact they are no more than impressions. But even if you just try to track the linear story without these original symbols, you still discover a very fascinating movie filled with splendid prints (cute ups close to beatles, larvas and other nasty insects are alternating with dream sequences great and also the dark atmosphere conferts the extra film style). Perhaps you can say that I did not quite get 'the movie' but I looked like hypnothised for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mystery.
