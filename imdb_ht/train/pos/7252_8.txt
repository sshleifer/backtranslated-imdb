I saw this film before they entered the British Army. I went to my basic training, at first hard and then as I progressed much easier. My time has passed during the heels of the issues of NI and the cold war. There have been times when I questioned myself what I had gotten into, not for long, as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The voice on use to show what the soldiers are thinking is spot on, even if I would have added breathing and heart rate as this looks like in your ear drum in the given situations. Some years later I was in Canada for a family to get together. A my Aunty residing in the US and a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio made a paper on the British Army's effect on NI. He spent some time doing research. Although an ancient partner he was very anti-British. He made a bee line for me and condemned me to be a British soldier. The only answer I saw was the movie 'A Dead Day Long'. It is near a civilian to realize why a soldier does what he does. The good answer to the end.
