Ah, true memories. I lived in Holland at the time, looking forward to it every evening evening and later Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good for me (in the school time) English, such as Dutch TVs, provide the translation for other languages, except for kiddies show nowadays. So you would hear original voices and languages. - The best series were the first three and then after the third series, the great character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think they were ever really keep it and still escape, leaving the rooms to appear again in an upcoming story because obviously the series was also distributed in Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not go on very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful job to persuade in the clever aristocratic Nazi show, who had this continuous obsession to take revenge on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high quality performance in a series of teens, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youth were so uncommon. They were very credible to me at the time and as a kid I could just imagine to be a part of these youths, who at the time were about four years older than me. It was a very interesting series for me, standing out of my memory at the times as a special show and the "Prisoner" as well. I hope they will publish a good quality DVD in the series, which would be wonderful. Even bad copies are always enjoyable to watch. The later series was not as good, watering down and just not as much fun as the first three. Hopefully they also find the other series and Von Gelb to be placed on DVD. Hello from Canada.
