I would not like to comment on how good the film was or was the flaws as I'm not a professional movie critic and I do not have enough knowledge in doing movies. What I know is that to make this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a great success and I would like to congratulate the Director for that. However, in some reviews, that I have read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationships with his brothers have not been marked, and his brothers and sisters have been completely erased in the story. Now I would really like to raise a point here that as the movie name suggests, not a movie about Hiralal's brother, it is a movie about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and her son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more no less. If we begin to complain about some characters being caught out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters do not fit into the picture, no matter how important they were in real life. So I think it would be best if we stayed in the main idea and stopped meeting a critical point in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
