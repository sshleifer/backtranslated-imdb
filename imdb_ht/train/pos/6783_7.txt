If you like "Othello," you will love this flick of film since half the movie revolves around the production stage of the play. The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as women in Colman's Life while Edmond O'Brien plays the initial press agent. A couple of players supporting I particularly liked being Millard Mitchell as the grizled reporter who found an angle with Joe Sawyer, the 1940 response to Drew Carey, who plays the cop on the case. <br /> <br /> The great raw moment of this one and realism noir at all.
