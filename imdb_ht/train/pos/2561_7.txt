Released in December 1957, Sayonara went to earn 8 Oscar nominations and would pull in 4 wins. Red buttons won Oscar for best supporting actors in her role as Joe Kelly's silvery agent who fell in love with a Japanese woman while stationed at Kobe during the Korean War. Oscar nominated for the leading actor, Marlon Brando plays Great Lloyd Gruver, a Korean flying war that has been placed in Japan, who is still well supported by the military opposition in marriage between American troops and Japanese women and try without Any success talking to her friend Joe Kelly from getting married. Ironically Marlon Brandos character soon finds love of his own in a woman of Japanese descent. This film emphasizes prejudice and cultural differences at that time. Films in beautiful colors and with stunning backgrounds I found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone. Good movie, gimme more ... GimmeClassics
