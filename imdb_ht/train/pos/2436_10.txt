Generally I like something light and fun, so this movie should not appeal to me. But he grabbed me from the start. History choices and family choices seem evident, but it raises the question about and about: "What if it was my family? My choice?" I called and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people involved. It was hard to look, but harder to turn back. The story is true, and life is sometimes hard to look! It shows what movie-makers can do without sex, violence, or special effects: a good story is a good story all alone. The best and most likely stories are all they are true. Like real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do things that they do!
