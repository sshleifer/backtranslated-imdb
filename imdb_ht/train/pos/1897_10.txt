Again, it seems totally logical, making me at least, that "Arthur" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot chief is totally "easy" if it is not quite "impossible" melding of component components disparate components. That he managed to make street life-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is, in itself, wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his finest role, and all other Cinemas component of its best impact, including the note, seems to me patent and blatant. I challenge anyone to sit in this movie and do not laugh loudly. But apparently, almost one-third of his audience was so managing. Well, I, for one, found and found Gordon's efforts both ridiculous and lovable, and the iikes of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great-tempting and Stephen Elliott's murder would be the father-in-law absolute gems character background. Even the black driver managed to save patronage, and late, sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his brother but wrong about undertaking his role. "Arthur" does not make any effort to "Underztand," much less streamlined, the "alcohol" ills (hey, iFit is not booze, it's other drug choice, including substance, and addiction is merely symptoms, not targets ), it simply observes in its own quizzical way.
