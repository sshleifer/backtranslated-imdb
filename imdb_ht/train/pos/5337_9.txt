It may be the rumor of the fall of 1987 after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel employs rock music as a medium of this movie for expressing his personal attitude to life, in which love, desires and frustration play a vital role. Rock music may not be the best vehicle for transmitting deep feelings, but it is not too appropriate to use it as the underground rock music maker bites more intense than one ordinary. The director focuses on illustrating subtle and ultimate affection in life rather than rock music only. The love between father and son, lovers, and friends is delicate and touchingly delivered to the fine performance. Mabel does not try to embellish rock musicians as all artists, rather, trying to reproduce a true life on screen, making great efforts in years' working on this project and gathering information from underground pubs to Beijing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Daniel gave probably the best performance in all of his movies made so far. Of course, its discouragement and reticence fit the blue mood of the movie perfectly.
