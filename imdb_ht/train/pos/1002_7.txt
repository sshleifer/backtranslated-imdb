Just two comments .... SEVEN year apart? Hardly proof of the relentless film pull-power! As mentioned, the small-budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a factor reducing its limited appeal. When you said that however the thing is not merit - either as entertainment, or as a scary trip to every one. <br /> True, the most basic scheme is a re-working of the Horror Amityville - only without much horror. More a case of intrigue! Gibney could make a more worthwhile impression if he played Halifax - investigating a couple of murders that are not connected to the "house" as the main suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall output of a high standard. It just neglects to engage the viewer particularly at key times. <br /> <br /> Did you take the DVD up for just $ 3.95 last week in my regular video store, I can not spell the expense. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
