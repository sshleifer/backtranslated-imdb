I am a member of a Canadian club and I can tell you the truth that salvation is synonymous with the peace and tranquility of the experience. As we put our boats in the water, banjoes echo in the back of the mind conscious. This film is timeless because it raises philosophical to the human spot in nature's effects and the technology on man's relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the house made tents. There are also dignitaries of the city with feelings of superiority in the woods "Woodman". The fact that the banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" means to put it on the same level with the woodsmen who also have toothache. Finally, the battle of life and death replaced the "civilized person" suppositives on the "Law". This boat trip ends too early for the viewer, but misfortune is not soon enough for the characters.
