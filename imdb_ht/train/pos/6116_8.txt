This movie is like saucepan. You either love it or hate it. If you go to this movie awaits a suitable movie and decent production value, a good scheme and great characters you will hate it. If you go to this movie awaits a low budget slasher you will probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go to this film awaiting to see one of the most disruptive characters in the movie in Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant at her on the top painting in the angry, frustrating coke movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are abysmal at best but really, who cares? If you are the kind of person who prepares to watch a Schizophreniac movie: The Whore Mangler you have undoubtedly seen scores of horror movie full of Gore. With this film budget made for even if they tried it would probably have the best mediocrity. I would rather be laughing at something worse than being affected by the mediocre. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, you'll probably hate this movie, but if you are one of those who decide to see it anyway it will be the best thing since slicing my # 2 bread hate casserole.
