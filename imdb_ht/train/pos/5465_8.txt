This is a cold-boiling cold warner film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A complete masterpiece of cool Machiavellian bearing, a technique she has been trying to eleven eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Charge", Stanwyck plays Lily Powers's daughter well-torn to a violent speakeasy owner in an asphocating steel town. She has been rendered cynical and numb by the years being offered up as a sexual favors to her dad. Once his father dies in a distillation blast, he deprives a freight train in New York and literally sleeps his way up the venture ladder into a bank. <br /> <br /> This would come across as preposterous was it not for launching Stanwyck's work here. With non-eyed methods and amorous seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to their aggressive carnalness. One of the youngsters seduced on the road is a cool-faced John Wayne as in all of this, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the third-last movie with a suicide murder, a silent silence-work in Paris holding Lily quiet with the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embeszzles money company keep it in luxury. A finishing finish is a bit disappointing but not before Stanwyck's gray screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's friendship link with an African American woman named Chico and German immigrants who teach Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
