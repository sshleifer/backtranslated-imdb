Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a traveling TV reporter and her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) in Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that the accommodations have fallen in with the full city hotels. So they traveled from town to a remote place and took advantage of the hospitality of Ernest Keller's seemingly friendly (a Sydney Lassick phenomenon). Would you not know it, Ernest and mediate partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) hid a big secret in the wineries: brutally, deformed, diapers-clad "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) that finally terrorized the girls . <br /> A good Lashick slit plays the true monster in this disturbing little pit movie. It builds slowly but surely in an intense confrontation / Climax, delivering the horror into small doses until the final hour. The hotel with the foreboding cellar - the great echo of "Psycho" here - are great settings. Most of all, the bad plot involves insects and patricides, allowing the movie to take on a truly black quality. But it also becomes intensely as we realize Junior is not one dimensional badge but as much a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. The <br /> <br /> The "Unseen" is a solid little movie horror worthy to discover.
