The "Matador" Pierce Brosnan stars as a burn out killer. Bond Bond Bond goes into seeds, too tight, garish clothes, gold chains, and an ugly head. Our struggling assassins, Julian Noble, are in Mexico, trying to regain his nerves. Staying at the hotel is a likable, down-to-lone businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), also trying to regain his balance. Danny desperate to close a contract and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinced Noble reveals certain techniques, which he demonstrated in a shooter. Noble is eventually targeted by his employer and shows up in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard made Q & A after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also down on his chances. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts, he decided to write a tale that no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan returns balance to this film. (There is life after bond!) It has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay for credit to finish it and tell everyone about the shooter. I look forward to Richard Shepard's project.
