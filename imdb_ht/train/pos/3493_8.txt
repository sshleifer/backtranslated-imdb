This movie is mixed. I loved it. It was really sweet and sincere. A family struggling, but not born in a dysfunctional family that is typical of today's films. The movie did not make it a problem that has little money or the Dominican Republican Hollywood path. <br /> Instead the problem is Victor is immature and needs to grow. She does, slowly, by the end of the movie. He has a way to go, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. Her grandmother is very nice and the scene where the little boy throws up was laughing for the longest time. An indie truly heartly
