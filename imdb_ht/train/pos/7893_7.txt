I guess I'm a part of the silent minority who enjoyed this movie. Is it the best one in the "nightmare" series? Perhaps not, but I was very pleased with it. Freddy Krueger comes to his bad, wise potential. Since part 4 and 5 of the series down, I felt this call final installment ("New Nightmare" is the ultimate real) brought the series out of its slump. There are some great nightmarish sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is both a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it from the dream, jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy bumps out the comic one-liner, "Great graphics." And since the film was made about 10 years ago, he brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove. Anyone remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo to remember the Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb. Lisa Zane perfectly threw into the lead. I did not see Yaphet Kotto since "The Man Run," and I think last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago. It is another great, underappreciated actor who owns a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the cameras? The best one is Johnny Depp (from the first "nightmare") to play a spokesman for a commercial anti-drug. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the 3D 3D is really scary! So, for those who are looking to check this movie out - please rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has elements of 3D remover. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see much wrong with the movie. It's even elaborated on Freddy's backstory. The film is a great mix of humor and crisis, and the gross-out effects are terrific. Did this provide the best justice franchise? Of course he could. Rachel Talalay had a good job. And to get the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And in closing, I loved the montage on the opening credits. Fans of the series will be happy, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy. <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
