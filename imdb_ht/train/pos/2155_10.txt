Shohei Sugiyama's accountant (KÃ´jiji Yakusho) feels bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his daughter's daughter. One night, while traveling home to train, she saw the beautiful figure of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later she decided to go to school and secretly take dance dance dance every Wednesday night. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret. Meanwhile, Masako feels the changes in the behavior of her husband happily reading, and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei has an affair. <br /> I just finished watching "Are we Dansu?" and I really liked it. What a beautiful and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed with the beauty of the cold and gracious of the wife of Masayuki Suo's director and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. About last September 06th, I saw the American rumor of "Are we Dansu?" for the first time, and I found it a delightful entertainment. But now I can say that it is another unnecessary renewal, and I recommend this movie instead. My vote is ten. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Danger Comigo?" ("Dance with me?")
