It's just funny, look it !!! <br /> <br /> OK they want 10 lines so there: This is a parody of the 50s / 70s werewolf movies. Many satire, some politics. Feel like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less slippery wood. If you like the Naked Guns films you'll love this too (once again less slapstick in this one). <br /> <br /> Actually, the humor ranges from light to sexual intercourse (inevitable in a teenage comedy), really interim social-political satire. The High School Transformation from 50s to 70s is really funny. The sequence and the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK maybe not brilliant, but still hilarious. There are tons (historic) slots starting from Paranoia in the cold 50s war and late late inflation .. Anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!
