I would not hesitate to put this adaptation into "Death Traps" in a top 5 list of best-ever-adapted movie adaptations. Caine and Reeves (a disgusting actor who never really got a chance to do more than soft romance and "Superman") plays one another very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - who I normally do not care - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoying value as an actress. It is not certain that the comparison of "Deathtrap" and "Sleuth" - another sound-screen adaptation featuring Michael Caine - are valid, or even just .. Yes, two stories have a lot of ownership. But "Sleuth" is as much about class wars as the bloody battle, and the house of "Sleuth" wear is at least as many a character in the movie as the two actors do not really have an equivalent of "Deathtrap". And "Deathtrap" is not so much a fight in blood as it is a pointing vinyl about how people have no good drugs (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they find. I'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre, and well worth your time and money. This is America, after all. You do not have to choose! I will not give away the twists and turns into the draw, but I do not think it is important anyway. I watched the DVD eight or nine times a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and distribution and meant, the moments are scary when things go "all-shaped". It all does well that the ride becomes more important than the current destination. Anyone who loves black-hearted comedy and suspicions in the Hitchcock movie-style film is practically enjoying "Deathtrap" incredibly.
