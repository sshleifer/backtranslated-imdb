Each scene was put together perfectly. This movie has a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr in it, no and ever will exist. He has the ability to brighten up any of his amazing talent films. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie rack of "Blockbuster" and love he called out to me, I could not resist his picking up and bring him home with me. You can call me a romantic santa, but this movie just touches my heart, not to mention making laugh and fun at the same time. Even though she made me cry, I admit, in the end, the movie all just brightened my outlook on life afterwards. I suggest in my horror, action, and finest humor movie at a fee, who absolutely adore this movie. This is a movie that has a good sense of feeling. It could make you laugh loudly, touch your heart, make you fall in love, and enjoy your life.Every time you probably walk past this movie, just be knowing that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspired movie. Who knows? What if it can really happen to you? And keep yourself open to the mysterious wonders of life.
