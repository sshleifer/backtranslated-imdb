Really enjoyed this little movie. It is a movie that moves on struggles, sacrifices and especially the obligations of friendship between different people (children of actors who play Miki are especially good). There are many large scale film screens placed around WW2, that this compelling story tells little story is a real break in the usual, with an original one in that. I'll also add that this movie is far from boring, very far away !! Of course the horses are wonderful with the enchanting scenery. For anyone who really treats the animals as part of the family (I do), you will find this movie especially rewarding. Recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different.
