What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the King of Z-level bloxploitation level, and here, he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is one roll-out ride-coaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and a lot of everything else you would never get in most modern movies (or any movies, really , haha!). Routine in stand-up it gives early on not to be missed! At any speed, D2 is definitely a fun way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and he's not got no classes! I'm gon 'rock this war up * him * a **!"
