This move actually had me jumping from my seat to participate in what the actors were going to do! The act was the best, Farrah should have gotten an Oscar for this it was fabulous. James Russo was so good I hated him being the villain and he played it wonderful. There are not many cinemas that have riveted me like this one. The cast was great Alfie looking shocked with these great eyes Farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived his horror as he went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and felt the same anger he felt you wanted him to hurt him, but you also knew he was the wrong thing to do. The movie has you on a roller coaster ride with you up and down with each scene.
