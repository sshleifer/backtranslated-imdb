This is a fun look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (decorated in black, of course) that sings many and tells a bit too. If you love Johnny Cash, this movie is quite enjoyable. Also remember blonde illustrations of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five people with blonde hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story at all.
