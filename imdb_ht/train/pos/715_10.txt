Anyone sitting here and saying that this weak film is Ramones they would probably say that Amadeus was ok if not for what disappointing gonichistur. Rock and Roll High School were centered around the Ramones. How anyone can watch this and does not get a kick from Joey Ramone feeds back sliced ​​sprouts in an attempt to keep it in performance condition is obviously a square blanket tied-father o. Ms Trogar, exploding the white mouse, the patrol room ... instant classic. Never enter Riff Randell's character. If you do not like the Ramones then you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK and ROLL HIGH SCHOOL.
