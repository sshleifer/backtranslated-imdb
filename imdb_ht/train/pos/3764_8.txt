Well, I'll admit it - I am a ball ball and I occasionally love a really funny comedy. While I've seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but merely fun. A few films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTON AND HOLY GRAIL, UHF, STARTING MY SAN REVOLUTION, STRANGE BROWS and Bill and Ted movies. They all miss snobbish calls, but only a zombie movie critic or professional flu can be. <br /> While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still great fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually looks improved and repeatedly looked. I remember not to like the movie the first time I saw it - possible because the other film puts such a high standard for laughing. But every time I see it again I am surprised at all the great moments - particularly those involving Reaper in Grim. And, by the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman's in the SEVENTH SEAL as you can get !! In addition to a lot of laughter, this film features some excellent music - so it's actually better than the movie first. The human kiss in the end is great, but the rest of the hard rock music is given to you by an old killjoy like De Nomolos. Great look for kids and adults alike.
