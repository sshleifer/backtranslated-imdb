I liked this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job describing Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hidden, along with her young, from a mysterious past. As an Anglophile who loves romance ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone escaping for some hours in the England in the 1800. I also must mention that Toby Stephens showing Magnetic Markhamham's highly magnetic is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
