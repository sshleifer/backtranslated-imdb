I must say, I thought I saw it all. I'm a very angry movie scrub. This movie was not my trauma, not any means. I'm past waypoint. But it took me to some emotional places I did not know I was able to attend. I had no idea that I could ever get (ick) the idea of ​​beastiality inherited. Never ever. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did it. I must give credit to the director. He pulled it. <br /> For the first 40 minutes of this film is a TOTAL done. We start off with very explicit feet of two horses having sex. After five minutes I began to wonder if this movie was not a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy on two couples. Then some nervous core race. Then we see (shortly) a hot chick get it on with a butler (but this is very short). At this point I was cursing the loud movie while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep in about 40 minutes of the mark and forced myself to end it night in the next. We finally find the right thing when a girl (who knows who she is, or who is in this film) has a dream about a Victorian-era gal that was ravaged by an animal-stuff in the jungle. The scene goes on for some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. It's nice shot, superbly edited, and deliver the merchandise. They try to wrap up the draw in the end and it sort of make sense but sort of by either. Oh well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (with my TV) but the last 50 minutes totally rachim it.
