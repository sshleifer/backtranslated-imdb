I think this film was one of Kurt Russels's good movies. Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think he's a good actor in any role he plays. But this movie has a lot of action in it and I know that it should be more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the master, but many did not like this movie. Oh well I thought it was good for me to think that everybody should see this movie. If you see this movie and love it I think you should also see Drake Drache and Kurt Russel. I give soldiers *** 1/2 from *****
