This series reads "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than those USA, but this time author has hit the right target to create a mix that works in a smooth way. Edel & Starck is great, it has all: great, smart, witty, yet well-timed, amazing, awesome theater featured by all the stars and beautiful shots in Berlin, one of the most exciting cities in the world. It's fun to see how things work in the field of justice in other countries than the USA and for once "feeling" old Europe way of dealing with life. Kudos throughout the cast and crew for a well-done comedy that will make a must see in the years to come. See the series in German is super.
