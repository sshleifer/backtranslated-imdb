"The odd couple" is one of those who is far from surmounting to its reputation. People all know it, they hum to sing the song they complain to live with a sloppy "Oscar" or a quick "Felix" ... but they're going to sell the movie without knowing it. This is not just about a guy who lives with a sloppy guy; It is a portrait of friends helping each other into agony in divorce. It's also humorous humor from start to finish, but it's kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful, and just plain horrible situations. So some viewers are actually getting the movie to be a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. In addition, Matthag's bulldog faces just cracks up! My favorite comedy, not a thousand countries.
