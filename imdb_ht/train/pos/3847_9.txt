In his time, this film had conflicting writing to everyone else (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> with very graphic death-scene imagery; A parachute that does not open * smack * body guy on the floor. A guy was eaten by a lion * chomp * tooth in the throat. With a guy being running over by a * zoom * zoom * without corps going down. But besides gore, this flicker also has some brilliant (and stunningly beautiful scenes), filmed in the Green Fisherman's Vlissingen; <br /> Thousands of Rosebuds flying on the screen, at a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) place flowers in a milk-case, surrounded by slabs of blood-flowing meat and a scene loves steam between two male characters, in a graveyard. <br /> <br /> The story is concluded in a frantic, but filled 10 minutes, which does not disappoint, and will let you sigh a breath of relief. <br /> Of course and the benefits come to the pit, some special effects are too over-the-top, and they obviously see how far Verhoeven was able to push the gore-factor (eg the several eyeballs hanging from support). Also, while the two actors lead, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), doing an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (described by Thom Hoffman instead of Un-Spacious) just feels enormously underdeveloped, Do it hard to care for, even after his tragic death. <br /> I've done my best to give you a slight idea of ​​what you can expect in this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easy to summar up the word. So make yourself a favor, if you reach this movie somewhere, look it! And enjoy the unique style with this masterpiece.
