An amazing movie good! It has quite a few good jokes thru out the entire movie. The only thing negative is that some scenes go to the extreme shows just how stupid of the main characters. We get it, blonde stupid, get on with it! <br /> <br /> The plot just barely dodging is called "coral". And the boobies are always a plus alto the movie for some strange reason by playing with that very same card that the line draws introduce two black haired women who act as part of the counter selling of our blonde. /> So all in all, a good movie to look. I almost give it an 8/10, but do not get crazy.
