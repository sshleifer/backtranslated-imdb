This is the best and most viewed show of the years. The more I look it the more I fall in love with it. Throwing is excellent, the writing is great. I personally love each character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personality and origin just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a bad thing to the writers, actors and the potential audience of this show, cancel quickly and do not advertise it enough or give it a real chance to find something. Some shows I look again as most television is awful. This show in my opinion was right up with my favorites Gray Anatomy and siblings. In fact, I think the same audience for siblings would like this show if they even knew about it. Why is it still the deficit to show that getting extra time and showing them with great potential still getting dropping right away. I am sick of reality shows I do not look any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire excellent actors, this show has plenty of promise. The last episode was one of the best yet as everyone started to really get to the parties and make the show so real. Please watch this show on the ABC video and let ABC know you want to show it.
