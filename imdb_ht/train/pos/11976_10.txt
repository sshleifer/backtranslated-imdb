This show is about three girls. (D.J., Stephanie, and Michelle) Mothers killed by a drunk driver for Danny Dads invited Brother-In-Law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living life. The girls go through the life and life sciences. They develop crushes, boyfriends, and many more. The whole show is basically about to go with the sink. You do not have to keep regret just having to let it go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and still watch it today. I'm glad they are still showing on television. I look it almost every day. I miss it 10/10.
