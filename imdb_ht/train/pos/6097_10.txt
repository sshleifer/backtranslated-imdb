I do not see how you can say that Freddy's nightmare is cheese and a rip-off. You obviously do not know the good TV when you see it. The episodes are packed with drama and blood. Freddy is creative in her way of life. I love Freddy's nightmare and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, Daze School, and Stinks Love. If you think that this series saves you then you have the right to your opinion, but remember it's just your opinion and that means nothing. Freddy's nightmare will always be one of the best series ever and you will come to accept that reality soon enough. If you do not like it then do not look it but do not refuse to shine it.
