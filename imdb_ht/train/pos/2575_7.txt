I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly '50s Sci-Fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length film of superman. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I find myself well-engaged and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil well penetrated about six miles to the ground and was close to the supporter. Lois and Clark show up to get the effect but they are ashamed that the deepest ever drilled will not be in operation. One day later, strange events of well made for a most suitable story for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactive golf gulf has raided six-mile deep into the ground near the earth's core. <br /> <br /> Supermen and the moles guys are a simplistic piece, but well-designed in social realism. Published in 1951, starting a lead actor who served in the Second World War, the moral of the story seems that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascist as any other people. To drive this house in a typical superman manner, Reeves even accused the mob of lynch hunting the moles for being 'Nazi' at one point. Even in the 1950s, science that concealed this film was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling in continental crust would not have even penetrated the robe above, let alone the "hollow center of the ground" - which, in any case, does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a comic book gold in gold. The movie is a little unbalanced rhythm. Although the Molten is interesting, somewhat creepy, and nicely outlined, there are several Corman-equipped scenes that over time have redundantly showing us odd behaviors. The script is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, the costume is poor just, but for her time, this special film effect and costume were pretty good. Cinematography is generally very good, and the act is better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
