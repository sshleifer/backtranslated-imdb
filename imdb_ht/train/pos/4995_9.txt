I do not think most of us would tend to apply the "must-see" theme of action movie, but I was very impressed by how good this film was and worth the "must-see" stamp but me. /> <br /> Mandy plays by Shannon Lee (Bruce Lee's big brother and sister at the end of Brandon Lee) recruited by Martin, a professional thief helping pull on a diamond heist in a museum for a criminal union, and get a nice reward for her. Little is known that another pair of robbers (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of Lovebirds), who were ripping earlier by Mandy and Martin to get in on the deal, are also planning to fly the diamond. How do each pair of robbers plan out the heist is a thrill to watch. Things go awry, as Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these robbers as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime union, which is unhappy of all that the diamond is not in its hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed, as there's a health dose of weapons, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat. Laugh and laugh (and I do not mean your typical one-Material prevalent films in action) that sneak into. <br /> It's not easy to root for bad guys, but we get to see the human side of those stolen and chemists they develop. <br /> A big movie with one PA missing! <br /> 9 out of 10
