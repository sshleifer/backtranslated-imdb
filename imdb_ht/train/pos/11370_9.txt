Spoilers - as far as I describe the characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The subject is at once tired and enticing. Dog determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply fascinating. With any exquisite due to him, his hangdog, always put-on expressions serve the character well. It is, as we are in England might say in the TV's Tagg TV series's inspectors, bind to be gloomy because he sees three killers in a week. Well, that's not exactly accurate as Chikatila operates over a number of years ... You get a real sense of resistance to blankets in the USSR bureaucrats, brilliantly described by Joss Ackland (which often seems made for this sort of role). A key character (and I wrote this as the notice of invasion of the Body Snatchers were shown on BBC1) is the Donald Sutherland character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support in Burakov is firm. And it endures Perestroika, and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> This is a must-see, as far as I'm concerned.
