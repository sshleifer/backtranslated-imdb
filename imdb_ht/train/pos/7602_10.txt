The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​being adjusted to the island, while the mysteries were explored (and saw) were just phenomena; full of suspension, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of ​​just seeing them getting used to the island. Then first see the smoke monster in the first episode really to keep my attention. Since then, I've tuned the second season was good on par with the 1st quarter, only a little better. I absolutely love the idea of ​​the Pigs and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole scheme and sequel of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. I liked the whole suspension surrounding other people on the island, but the DHARMA story really made epic 2 amazing. Season 3 was not quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but however great. I loved seeing the stories back-in the others, seeing the camps, and seeing the more exploration mysteries. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not as good, was always breathtaking and fun, but most of all interesting! Now the 4th season. I was hoping for this season, and the 1 couple of episodes we're good, but then it really started getting boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY ignore the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot was old after the first couple episodes ... and most of all .... Season 4 was taken away from something that had lost a perfect set: the mystery, suspense, the comedy mixed (Charlie goes) and excitement in general. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.
