I got this one a few weeks ago and love it! It's modern, light, but filled with true complexes in life. Read questions and answers, just like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, with Jossi & Jagger. This is a lot more, universal, than just the bubbles we can live in. You do not need Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - I'm not, but the movie goes directly to my top ten cinemas. At first it seems like most entertainment, but it makes you think further. The relationship we have to live with is superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, or not. You do not know what's coming, and you definitely do not know where this story is heading as you watch it first. It is worth seeing many times. Fox Cinema includes great bonus material - here's a great music video and "making of" (including explanation on the title, interview Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and Arabs who are skeptical about Israeli life styles).
