I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say it is not. Boring .... ??? Perhaps the one who said it is boring is because he / she is boring. She is a great actress and the movie was excellent. It has lots of wonderful and very good performers. The direction was great. I imagine myself in the French setting with everything complicated and perfumes, flowers, churches, issues, etc. When she goes to the sister shop is simply amazing. Everything is great. We have a very good and wonderful actress, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love her more than in her movie after her science sciences. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> Ana
