I think James Cameron might become my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the Titanic RMS. It was great, fast, and "unbeatable" ... until April 1912. It was all the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but the stars of fictional characters must be in the spotlight instead of the boat. Well, on the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and reality zero and the only reality that will be present is an event in the movie. <br /> So, our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They do not bother too much but look at this and you'll find out why they could become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, but from God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you find? Oh yes! We get a love story about a sailing ship. The characters supported are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (Love Island), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and many more. We also had the treasure hunter presenter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something in the story, something good. The action here is scary, especially in the second half, the drama as well. At the end you can have your eyes thrown rainstorms or silent eyes. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks hearts in the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a diamond bearing the diamond. He calls and tells his story about the Titanic RMS. Two lovers separated by social classes and finally, the fate of the boat. Everything about the story is working and there are many flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome
