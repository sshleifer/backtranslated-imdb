Look at the Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the movie and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still tied to Germany's Nazi by that non-aggression packet signed in August in 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman had simply echoed the Communist Party line, the line did not change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of his time with this work. <br /> <br /> Look at playing on the Rhine running from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came from Broadway repeating the Wil Wilson roles as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest the son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most important villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. Lukas pulled an award-winning hat in 1943 with an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and New York Film Critics for Best Actress. Probably if Tony's rewards were in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more noteworthy when you consider who he was against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper's For whom the Bell tolls, Mickey Rooney of the human committee, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was a bigger movie name box than he was. The Lukas nomination usually types the Academy round around a field. Jack Warner knew what is why Mady Christian did not repeat his Broadway party with the role of wife Lukas giving Bette Davis. Davis took part not because this was a specially bursting role, but because he believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It is the same reason he made Man who came to dinner, a lighter play than this one. <br /> Davis is a daytime daughter of the Supreme Court of America who marries a German national back in the Weimar days. After years of vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and three children have come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They are welcomed by Lucile Watson who is very pleased at the ultimate meeting of his grandchildren. The flying in this odor are some other guest guests, a Davis friend from day to day Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband are also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocratic George Coulouris. Coulouris is an IUD and a spendthrift and feels an opportunity to duplicate when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family was vagabond they came. Lukas fought in Spain on the republican side and was injured. His health was not the same way. Her family faithfully supports her in all her decisions. These decisions affect all other members of the cast. <br /> Add quite a bit more of the Broadway play including some cute fascist creatures were Dashiell Hammett that was significant to Lillian Hellman's other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation and such sweetness as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is really one of the most despicable characters ever to wear for such screens as there are no Runmanian accounts. It was a metaphor for his own country that embraced Nazi and gusto and then equally denied them without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was up for Best Comedy Support in 1943, but lost in Katina Paxinou's For whom the Bell Peaks. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted scenario and the movie itself lost for best photographs and other anti-fascist classics, Casablanca. Even if it's a firmly planted item at that specific moment, look at the rin still pack a sharply anti-fascist message that brings infinitely repeatedly.
