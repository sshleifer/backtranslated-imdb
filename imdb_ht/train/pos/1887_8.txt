Arthur is a rich way of 'kid' that drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and tells him to go into his mind. She loves to boast about her wealth, she knows that she's a spoiled roast. She spends money on people she does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high school girl inherited a great wealth but it fell in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (it looks really strange). This is a funny movie movie. I watched this movie because it's a very popular American movie 'Sharabee' based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur' I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. It's too late at times. There are many fantastic lyricists in the movie. It's not a laughing riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©'s father and keeps talking about the 'Moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some funny distribution. It is very good with words and body language. I liked the scene where he spoke standing in a couple sitting at the hotel on a 'little' country and kept talking to husband and wife in two different directions. Jan Gielgud received an Oscar for this movie. I do not know that actor. I do not think he did a good job but maybe if I look more at his work I can agree in the future. Films have some flat plates, but not very long. looking forward to looking at the end.
