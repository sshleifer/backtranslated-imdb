Small, small, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his character and does something enormous from him. In front of behind the camera it creates one of the most uncomfortable officials I've had to enjoy seeing and seeing and seeing again. He never let me down.

The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes on it, and, of course, us, me. These buildings are populated by award winning award winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lilac Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, this is compulsory look. One, two, three, many, many views.
