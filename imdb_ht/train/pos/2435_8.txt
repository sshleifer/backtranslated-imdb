I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears in my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Speaking about Africa, I so much want to see Casper's cartoon entitled The Ghost of Friendship (1945), but when I saw the cartoon, Boos Good Night (1948 ), It makes me break! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox found dead! I have never seen anything like that in the other Casper Cartes! This is one of the infamous of all! It was so depressing, I just could not watch it again. It's just like seeing Lassie dying at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for our old cartoon fans to handle like me! If I wanted to look something old and classic, I prefer to look something happy and funny! But when I think about this cartoon, I think about my cat!
