While I wanted this movie since my first time to watch the trailer, I was in for a deep surprise with this movie. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too much ?? Cartoonish, 'The Dark Nature Of The Movie Really Does That A Very Different Experience. Instead of feeling-good-happy-story, this movie takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting, but also disturbing. Most kids will not understand some of the darkest moments in the movie, making this movie rather look for adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of boilers and slats. The music note was once again solid, proving Hans Zimmer is the go-go guy when it comes to anime note, and I never thought I could say I actually enjoyed Brian Adams's music.
