Original Knight Knight Returns to this ace adventure movie that rivals the Mask of Phantasm in its calm. There's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, so much more Batman than ever or Batman and Robin. There's a new crime-fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dressed like a stick but not an adult Batgirl. And Batman is denying any affiliation with him. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romance and detective work. But the penguins, the bath and the local crowd make these little things more complicated. <br /> I did not have high hopes for this one and have since been strongly left down, but Batman's weak: Sub zero (Robin is not so much here!) but I was happy with the imaginative pieces and interesting, the smart scheme and a sting sense of humor. This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without. Keeping your ears open for a really catchy song called 'Betcha Neva' which is featured in-out. <br /> It's a shame the DVD is not so great. Do not get me wrong to have some great features (short 'Chase me is awesome) and a pretty cool Dolby 5.1 band but ... the movie is featured in Pan and Scan. Batman: Batwoman's mystery was drawn and shot at 1.85: 1 but this DVD is presented at 1.33: 1 in comparison to the widespread clips shown on the features that have snap photos on both sides. I found this very annoying considering the Phantasm mask introduced in embracing anamorphic. Warner had to re-release literally dozens of movies on DVD because people complained about the lack of original Aspect Properties available on some titles. Why chose to make the same mistake here is beyond me. <br /> I would give this 5/5 DVD but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5. It's a shame because widescreen would have completed a big DVD pack.
