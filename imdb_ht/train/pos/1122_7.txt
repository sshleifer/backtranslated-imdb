Four driving drive leads to Fort Laurdale for spring break. Unfortunately they found a flat tire in Medley, Georgia and one of the girls witnessed a deep brutal murder in the woods. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a wonderful surprise low budget. The cast is likable enough, the direction is constant and the violence is particularly embarrassing and misogynistic.Especially the second murder is very grim. The murderer sheriff is not one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems he feels remorse for what he did. Complete involving the two boys they meet at the diner goes nowhere, but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
