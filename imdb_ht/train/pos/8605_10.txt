Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy stars in this "modern" music featuring MacDonald's comic capabilities. Surreal 40s music seems to be fun in mod 40s as they were in vogue current. Eye-popping costumes and sets (yes B & W) add to the quality of dreams of the movie all. Several well-animated films, and the "Twinkle in Your Eyes" number one record, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also at great cast are Edward Everett Horton, Regin Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also seen in the extended part are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald's jitterbug / vampire routine. He could do it all.
