The House of the Spirit is a tremendous story of family intrigue, Southern American politics and super-natural power. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons brought Isabel Allende to life with all his passion and suspense. This, in my view, is one of the best films in the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba aged and mellowows very faithfully, while Meryl Streep's role in Clara holds it gentle, loves the heat of her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a beautiful couple fighting for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as the sister of Esteban, provided a very moving performance. The country of Portugal is a reasonable replacement for a non-tropical Latin American country. Clara's home environment and the Ranch Esteban are efficient and the US car periods add nicely to the post-war atmosphere.
