This is a wonderful new series of crimes, bringing together three old stalwarts in British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detective bringing back to help clear up old cases under the pi small, focused focus on Amanda Redman. Three original, old heat cops make a brilliant team, applying old detection methods to a police force that has shifted a long way off since then - sometimes with effects, in other times the horror of senior officers them. Three are described sympathetic, warlike and all. There are splendid silly scenes, and some people are very moved as each of the three has come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pass. <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we have promised a series next year) each of the characters developed. Widmer James Bolam can not come to terms with his wife's death. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medicine! While Amanda Redman faced the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and career. The story lines were interesting, though rather heavy on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is the relationship of four of Britain's finest actors who made the series indisputable.
