There seems to be only two types of review of this film on the net. Those who hate her, cursed Ralph Bakshis and those who love her and call her to work in genious. I'm inclined to be in the middle. I was forced to agree with most of the critics of this film (such as the cruel cut in the story, seriously rotoscoped charecters, acting etc.) But discuss what I still love this movie. The Rotoscoping (when done well) adds a weird dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. The surreal scenes when the Niniiders pursue Frodo are stylish and well executed with the music note ... magic. Unfortunately the wrong movie is in hand, but if you can bring yourself to ignoring it it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this movie after writing this review, ah well, as is life)
