This film is hard to look at our fast-paced culture in the 21st century, but it's worth it for the messages that it translates, primarily the consequences and the division of technology on society, especially when using technology for war. /> <br /> This film presents a full circle of disunibration and rehumanism as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary story against misuse of technology, but as the circle completing himself, the familiar themes and feelings pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that mankind can use technology. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! must. In the end, free will and free choices are once again posed in humanity as a means of controlling our own destiny rather than being served by someone else or indeed, the state of society itself, including those shape by world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are downtrodden by what life washing routes sometimes tend to be so, but still there is still a glimmer of hope and continuity, as this poits film. / <br /> As far as skilled as sci-fi, one of the greatest common demons in which genre is it's speculative nature. He asks us questions, what if these events happen in this way, and what effect does it have on the society or people in it? How would we react? <br /> <br /> As far as Influence, this film projects these speculative studies that make Sci-Fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking these important questions.
