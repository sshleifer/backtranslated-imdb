The three main characters are very well portrayed, especially Anisio by rock musicians back to the first time actor Paulo Miklos. It is very compelling as the lower trespasser / occupant class. The film shows the beautiful Snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business, the contrast and the similarities between classes are lower and higher. How are all people brought away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
