I can understand those who do not like this movie in a lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but broker tenants, and one who does not know the difference will not understand half of the film, and certainly not at the end. This is a complete work of the life of women and the needs of this era. All important things, and certainly ways to dress, all over the movie means more than words. For those who thought it was a bizarre geisha movie, I'll suggest you read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of reality. This is Kurosawa's work is life, and I ensure that the director understands the silent meaning of Kurosawa's piece in the intellectual right series.
