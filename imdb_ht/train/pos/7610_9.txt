Only see season 1 so far but this is just great !! A wide variety of people stuck on an island. No one seems to be and everyone seems to have loads of skeletons in the wardrobe ... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why so big? It probably is not but then in a full set of X Folder, a dose of "what" ?? with a great "hey" and an island that is everything you ever dreamed of - your freakiest nightmare and you will lose. The story has received many twists and turns it incredible. Great set up, solid act and an acceptable release that at the end of everybody is people (well almost everyone ... I think ...) and good and bad places. But ohr oh so etr ...
