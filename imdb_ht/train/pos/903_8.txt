I can honestly say I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family films. I'm away from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The film's latest film (MPKDH was complete sort .. And the music was very boring and bland.But there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath, and Anupam Kher are very talented .. So, a few more points .. <br /> I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed. It brings us the young lovers of MPK with a pinch of the HAHK wedding, and We have a winner.This story description is similar to HAHK, the light of the beginning at the beginning of the serious fashion in the end. The director also made the character that you might have related to. The thing I do not like about HAHK was that character They were too exemplary. His Shahid Kapoor perfection seized me with a good performance. This is a major improvement, and most importantly it suits the best role of Amrita Rao. In fact, this is best His performance is so electrified, you are bound to love his performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An Upher Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terrified Dispose of no one actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were quite disappointing but will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also beautiful in watching. The songs are not colorful and dance, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein who is bound to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the flaw in the movie? The film gets slower, and the finish is well stretched. But the movie always goes through a good rhythm, making it a perfect family movie.
