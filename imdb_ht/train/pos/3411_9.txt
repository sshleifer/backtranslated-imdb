This is an easy 9. Michel Serrault, known more for the comic role in the earliest part of his career acting, makes a stunning, even anxious stunning job to imitate Dr. Petiot, a legendary French legendary assassin. It is just so credible to each and every moment of the movie, which the actor completely disappears behind the character - only best ever to realize this feat, and when doing it is only a handful of parts at best. > <br /> The whole story (a real story that happened in 20th Century France) is so powerful, so disaster - it does for a very strong movie that one remembers for a long time.
