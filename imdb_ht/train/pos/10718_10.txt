Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and also inspires others. The act was excellent with my wife and I went to Lea Thompson in Cabaret later years due to her performance in the movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger crash is delayed and hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger crash is coming. I knew one of the Challenger Astronauts in and about since the children at Carnegie Mellon's campus where my dad went to school; I also knew a close friend of the pilot late. <br /> I've reviewed the technical review last year for the BSA National Boy Scout Astronautics Boy Scout and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend for Scouts making my Merit My Spare Space. <br /> I met at late astronomy again as an adult and followed a schedule of engineering education we put together when Challenger blew up. I wound up sitting in with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", going on things after the crash of the Astrotech shareholders meetings by chance as a consequence, so I'm closer to the Accident and film similarities. I was certain that I was a good student and finished four years later, oddly enough, on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who said they did not fly Challenger in 1986 and later built Endeavor.
