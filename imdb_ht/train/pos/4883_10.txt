We, as a family, were so happy with the 'Last of Blond Bombs' we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> The act is A1 and the cast has many favorite actors and musicians. The theme is odd and the script is well written. The music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sing the songs at the top of our voice. To describe the story here would spoil the 'plot' as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Full of this brand is the most enjoyable and uplifting and we recommend it to anyone looking for a belly laugh and lots of music.
