I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight. I had to find the round characters, because they left an impression of my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie. And the finish, now that's sad, well ... for a kid 7-8 years old. <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, character, with two dimensions ... I guess it's films that you can only and innocent of a Little children ... Spare ... <br /> I recommend this one to all your parents and little ones ... (I've seen it in its original French version, so I can not tell you the translation is good or not.)
