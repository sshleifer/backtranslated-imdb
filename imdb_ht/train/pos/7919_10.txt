No doubt intended as a totally joking, "Full Moon High" shows 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying her father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Of course enough, Tony gets bitten, and grows fur and defenses whenever there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not be as old as it was curious, and that he met a destiny - even if it took twenty years. <br /> But otherwise, the movie just plain silly once it comes. Ed McMahon's character is a yak right yak patriotic yahoo (he thinks that everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach / director is a teeband teens, and then there is more. One of the most popular cast members is Demond Wilson - better than Lamont's "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is changing the presidents; Then Gag and Gerald Ford really summoned him up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Consider Alan Arkin - who plays a prominent psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his son, wondering whether he remembered co-starring with the two of them in this movie ( aside from his son Adam's hand). Quite funny. Also begins Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the movie movie "It's alive".
