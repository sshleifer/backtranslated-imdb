Odyard made here a very interesting movie. It starts with a description of a young woman almost deaf, in his universe as a secretary; It is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring an internal as an assistant appears to find someone in his life: but the guy is just coming out of prison. Both are rejected by society to assemble progressively. Character 'description is profound, go into detail ... both begin to help each other; so it can read on the mouth, which reveals itself to be very helpful for him ... It will progressively evolve, far from what it was first. <br /> It's pretty well filmed; The whole is very compelling, even if it gets into a movie noir in the end. Humans are particularly well-watched in Audiard's film. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated at the Best Act Cesar Awards to play his magistral. Actions towards the end of the film prevented it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It's actually surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
