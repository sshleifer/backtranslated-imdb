'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He does not like it, but it is sweet and good people. When she left visiting her dead mother in Italy Loretta met Ronny Johnny's brother (Nicolas Cage). She and Johnny have not talked to each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite her to the wedding. Of course they immediately fall apart. History stories and Loretta's favorite stories and uncle and uncle develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Each view is a pleasure to look, and Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. He won and really deserves Oscar this year. Cage is very good, with jumps as well, with Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific. This movie is funny, good and therefore very enjoyable.
