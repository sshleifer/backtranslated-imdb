"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the movie. What else has to say? <br /> This character really carries out the moron of Moroni. A gangster that is difficult and an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would be frustrating to be difficult and yet can not express yourself intelligence. Morrison's dream will go down to the stories of film history as one of the greatest of all Mores. <br /> There is of course great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. So Joe Piscipo. <br /> I just like the fact that Moronie caught the movie from an "R" rating because he could not pronounce profanity.
