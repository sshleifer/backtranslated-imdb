New York, I love you finally doing it at our shores, but its 10 short story about love somehow did not find enough grounds to be released on Valentine, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar New Year, and with the coming of Lincoln's blockbuster film comes from the love of Jackie Chan (no, no spy next door) and local neo film cinematographer who has traditionally released his latest movie about this period of success. So, why to fix a formula that has not been broken? <br /> <br /> Continue to Concept where Paris, Je T'aime started in the franchisee of love franchise (Shanghai will next, so say the end of the credit close here), the buzz here is definitely On the interrupted stories set in one of the cities in the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over come with story-based love like a theme, although someone probably forgot to say Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points In the sandbox landing rules, and shortly she unceremoniously dropped into the theater edition so she could fit into anything else (well, she was shot in black and white), but here she hoped she would do it in the DVD at least . <br /> <br /> Structurally, this series is less compartan compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right there has been individual story set in its own limit and never really breaks out of its artificial border create. Here is a little more leeway to give, where characters of various stories communicate in short filler segments used stage bridges together, and not only depends on collecting shots that are made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of doing things These look a bit more serendipitous with the idea of ​​luck encounters among strangers, though one story craftily adopts this attitude to its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris. <br /> One of the top tracks for sitting in a movie like this one is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematics to various geography and the origins of the mirroring makeup of the cosmopolitan city , come together for a concept movie. And what's more the star-nailed cast, and great names amongst the youngest are known all the haunting ups of perfect performance pictures, be it all the length of the short, or as a support to build on. You can not deny the star-staring initial recognition, from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also writes and directs duty), Rachel Bilson (as well as Bardot) in Blue Playboy's Playboy's Shia LaBeouf People who are surprisingly able to act, and the more show in his few minutes here than his entire pornography date. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Some are right in nature, while others have come up with Torsion Gimmicky who fortunately worked. But these 10 more stories 1 (because Randall Balsmeyer has been giving assignments to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plainly pick up shots in smaller known and established landmarks) somehow miss more "anything to go "The spirit comes from its predecessor, and more roots stories in reality, compared to fabulous elements of the previous film (Ali Wood Wood with any Vampire?), or even less adventurous and its narrative style (Christopher Doyle , and Tom Tykwer begins Natalie Portman. Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted for safe, with no adventures of the spirit of adventure and experience. <br /> <br /> Minor shrimp aside, I always enjoy almost all the shorts here, contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short movie format is still alive, and has to work together in a feature of the city of banner that works fine, and let me ask which other city or was included in its programmers. I hope maybe the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. We surely have enough prolific cremators to be stringing along a Singapore, I love you, so here's my finger crossing that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise there's always Sawasdee Bangkok the way to just do it without any attachment to franchise home policy.
