Bill Paxton's star and direct this very original movie. Having looked at my first time was not how good it was. The comments I heard were OK. As a result, I expect an average thriller of most .However, because of Paxton 's excellent directing and acting film is well worth watching, especially if you are a horror movie fan. The film also helps by twists to draw that hold come close credit. The strongest movies are the storyline that I said is very original and it's like I've ever seen before. Well done also the 2 young guys who perfectly transmit their emotions if these boys are confused. I give this 9/10 movie and I highly recommend that everyone captures it.
