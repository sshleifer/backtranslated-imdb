Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as director, and shows his versatility by directing a music, after his previous film was heavy playwright. He also plays a camera as the conductor. <br /> You can say it is a pre film film, and nothing like it did in the US for quite a while later (like 30+ years). Leisen has shot musical numbers for being like that the audience would see - there is no widescreen shots or from above Alba Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you have never actually seen the audience. As others have mentioned driving are fairly characteristic, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play normal movie characters. Gertrude Michael however gives a bit of spark. The music numbers are interesting and some good (Rhapsody's rape in particular is fun) but the compelling and false drama - three killers are too many and have minimum emotional impact on their characters. This is where this film could be a lot better.
