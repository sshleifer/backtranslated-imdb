I really enjoyed this movie as a teenager. At that age I thought that the antique baseballs were funny and that the film was "cool" because of it's about sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed movie was. This movie opened my eyes as a child in the struggling other children were faced with real-world issues. This type of exposure is largely lacking in children's cinema days that I do not think is the benefit of our society. Ensure that the baseball antics seem really dumb now, but they have drawn kids in. There are seven years old who will be asked to see a movie about foster children, but will be asked to see a movie on baseball. Disney realizes this fact and takes advantage of it teaching these children an important lesson on the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult performer at Al and the other angels looks far less impressive, however I'll give credit to the actors playing both kids and Danny Glover who all did a fantastic job.
