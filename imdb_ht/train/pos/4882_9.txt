It's a funny business, revisiting movies. These days when "inner emotional" and "emotional detachment" are favored on right sensitivity, it must be difficult to loyal to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after completing jury at 58th Berlinale, I managed to hold Kabei Yoji Yamada. <br /> After screening, I watched as they woke up from the theater, tear-eye, men, women, and review rooms alike. Even the director of the Berlinale, obviously a stubborn visualizer of cinema, confessed to being caught unawares and found himself crying the three quarters of this unashamedly sentimental experience. <br /> But what really surprised me was the comments that followed. Although inevitably moved by the movie, many revisions have been chosen to be tepid and emotional in the writings. Apparently, after crying, they put on the "caps of their thoughts", and so, missing out on what I felt was the genius on Kabei. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Through a series of emotional extended scenes, Yamada gets familiar to the man, his loyal wife and the two daughters, as well as three side characters? Sister beautiful boy, an old student bumbling, and a setting in a uncle? ? all come to help the family cope with their combat, in the absence of the man at home. <br /> <br /> The story moves along in a slow albeit fixed rising, and heartbreaks reach precisely moments everybody is able to predict. This of course makes it close to impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally confused by any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although you learn to love the family and helpers, and sympathize with the unfortunate situation, you get that prevented by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself waiting a particular type of end. <br /> However, two hours of the movie (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer and enough moments of gravity and deliberation to tie you together), he hit you with what I can only describe as the "poke". All you supposed to be what the story was about an innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughter ?? now suddenly point to one of the helpers of their families. Someone you've been given for granted is now thrown into an unexpected death of fate. At that point, something curious happened in the theater I was in. Everyone began to begging with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My Word!" I mutter my breath. He hit me then that "Kabei", in the final analysis, was more than a movie about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war. It was, in fact, a cynical test of one common human foam: How little we care about the secret feelings of those closest to us. Now the most common criticisms on the film were that it was technically solid, but lacked innovation. This is what happens when revisions put on pronunciation lips think, I guess. With Kabei, I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to handle touching on one unique aspect of humanity. An old trick of trick he is so seamlessly implemented in the Tor-San series, and later, in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> After lulling the audience into a sort of comfortable narrative area, it launches us into a realm of emotional raman explored in movies. <br /> This, for me, is the most effective cinematic tool at all. One that avoids detection, but affects you deeply. And proof of its effectiveness was a piece of wet cloth in Kleenex, dropping into a waste bin just outside of this mile-seater movie room. <br /> Now, if only some reviews might resist being so caught up and being smart that they forget what movies are really over. Human emotions. Most and simple.
