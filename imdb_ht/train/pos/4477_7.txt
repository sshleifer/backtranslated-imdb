This one has a lot to go for - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - with a smaller amount of overhead - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little hum hum - Kelly. It was the real sinatra of the real movie where the producer spent a buck and you could see it on the screen (before it would appear in two low budget, higher and higher with live stages) but if they only counted on The Grayson Grays Gray Grid Pipes plus the Iturbi month-outfit piano show we would have left with a much tight movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As he is reading many of his songs from the two Duets and Kelly - We hate to leave, I asked him - his own solo, What to do the Sunset, the charm of you and I fell in love too easy. Although this stage lives the best Sinatra music in the forties on one tenth budget.
