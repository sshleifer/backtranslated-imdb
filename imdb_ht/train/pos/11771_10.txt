Great entertainment from the start to the end. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. There are some twists and scenes much action. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the scenario, good music. Dalton as the tough sheriff and Railsback as "redneck-cruel". I must recommend this movie for every action adventure fan! 10/10
