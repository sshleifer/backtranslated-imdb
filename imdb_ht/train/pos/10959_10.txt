All I can say is if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! Even after looking at her for the first time, I was hooked. It's a fascinating experience that's difficult to describe, as I'm sure other fans will attain them. After watching it, you will cry to think that these two beautiful ladies are not with us anymore. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think we've ever owned the fierce independence of these ladies was honored with. Although I still admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not dwell in your heart the Big Way and Little Edie do. What a rare treat they have to know of these people; I just want I was!
