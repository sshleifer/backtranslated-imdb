In 1978 a phenomenon started. The release of the John Carpenter's "Halloween" got people entering the block of witnesses the evil of Michael Meyers. The critics loved her, the world loved her, she was imitating, and she went down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. 15 draw after an assassination took place, four friends (all the women) are babysitting (and have it on with the boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers Returns to his home town at the foot of these people. He killed 3 people in silence and subtlety. It does not speak. It slowly moves. It's hidden ... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends saved, after being saved by Dr. Loomis (Michael's pursuit and doctor) <br /> There is a reason why Halloween is working so well . Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he's killed, and he's angry. They are the only reasons why we are afraid. <br /> <br /> As the script writer, and directed. It builds unbearable tensions throughout the story, and crises to such a degree, sometimes we can not look. And the climax is really amazed. <br /> <br /> As a horror, this is essential. It is foolish and well-off. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a person. A force that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> Switzerland focuses too much around Michael and his "story". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this is a masterpiece.
