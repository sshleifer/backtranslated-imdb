This is one of the movies / pilots that if you knew BattleStar Galactica it helped, but not needed. What makes this even more credible in a history than BSG is that this is not something too far in the future. This has a depth of it that it is quite amazing it has not been published teatrically. Driving could not have been chosen best in such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as the father will do anything to be re-united with his / her daughter however real or not he is & he will do it does not matter the cost. Paula Malcomson's "deadwood" fame is terrific as his wife as well. You're not sure completely of its motive whether it's in love or money or both, but that's what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I saw a star of Zoe played by the unknown family Alessandra Torresani & her performance. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to see one loved him again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral obedience. I did not think this would be a good idea when it was announced, but in the pilot alone I am thrilled to see how we got to the BSG stage story. It is good to see Adam as a child already affected and influenced by different types of robots to begin to instill life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up their stories so we can know more as they got the Humanoid typing robots. This is a nearly perfect pilot & I hope they can keep telling the fantastic story. Even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you have not gotten to BSG, @ least try this & I'll bet you become a fan and will want to see how the BSG story happens to be.
