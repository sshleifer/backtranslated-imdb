I just got this video used and I watched it last night. The act started out very bad (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but got very good soon after ward. The tornadoes looked very fake, and many of the CGI effects were very scared, but the scene and the house split apart and the inside were blown around and aspired out they were very well done, and just about on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also very well done. The story was very well written, and it's worthwhile to see a movie like this losing away the old "disaster mechanisms" movies in this genre seem to have stuck in for 30 years. The film has a very unusual mix of FX and quality acting, this is the A benefit of my book.
