This film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 at a single audience familiar with modern sounds that are more than productive and computerized techniques reinforced. The experience of the movie visitors in 1922 was able to only see this in a movie theater with others on the big screen to be really profound with a very satisfying experience. <br /> One asked could be a movie maker today to make a two-hour movie silence and make it interesting and to achieve even temples structure and balance like this movie has. Filming has been most artistic, it has kept the attention of its structure, direction and act - there was no padding out with more words or computer distraction products. A non-performing or non-refreshing movie is inactive. <br /> <br /> This movie needs to be put into context for those who might be loosening and the mention of Christian theme. This is not a movie 'Christiany', it does not sell anything. These terms and references to moral standards now appear in that era - also church goes on Sunday was a past national past, Christianity has given in most homes so the film is only depicting normal life as it was then. The terms would be lower and deep at the time. <br /> It is most odd to provide the strong support of good Christian thought in this particular film (and not preaching religion to anyone, only to highlight the difference between the hypocrites and the honest) In 1922 a Pastor of an open debate with a representative of the film industry and a great crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, along with some others he called. NY Times 1922. Maybe you should watch this movie which also came from 1922 and, learned some lessons. The pastor complains that since the film industry began the attendance church had fallen to 500,000. Representatives of the movie debate however made these observations; that the presence of saloon was also falling, there were many pastors in jail than actors (facts) and who chose a few examples among the many were not representatives of the whole. So there was a continuous battle between churches and the film industry during the early days of film. This is a wonderful movie about being honest and true to family friends and being willing to sacrifice. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness with joy, faithful, humorous and silent sacrificing - even though the poor and incredulous she represents the perfect character. This however is not push down to the throat but reveal bit by bit in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where the characters slowly, languidly reveal about the course of a movie and it is this Tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> It has a list of same temples for the first half that builds all the elements for the latest section. The last 30 minutes are great movie making and it should be appreciated that he has achieved no benefit in sound, running dialogue - it has been achieved through clay and high-pitched clay. It is sometimes surprising to realize that by the end of the movie you have not heard a word spoken, but it feels like you've heard everything. <br /> <br /> Throw in support put in great performance especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! This is a special kind of touch humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin utilizes this device frequently and copies some from Pickford. Another special observation must be made on Silent films and especially Pickford films that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the film without hearing that gets jaded or bored, and the actors are over-exposed. That Pickford is usually quite the center of attention in most of his movies but the people still could not get enough of it is a will of fine ability to act.
