I just saw this delightful Japanese movie film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Bargaining Film Festival in the Virginia Historical Theater in Champaign, Illinois. Although this film, subtitled in English, has dance parlor as its heart, the movie actually shows the outside world of Japan how the rigid structures of family, work (wages), and recreation still exist in modern Japan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> [Also, I will not use the movie character names when world readers can not be familiar with the formal Japanese name that can be confused. I'm going to refer to the actors <br /> by their professional names as it's listed in Databank Database.] She stressed the help of her real life wife, professional dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his debut, and , so far, only motion picture. He is a dance teacher at his father's dance studio. But his real ambition is to compete once more in a Competition Dance Competition that he has disqualified in the past. No, I will not say "why." See the movie. Salaries Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the movie. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, it provides a sterling performance to a company 40 something <br /> <br /> with a beautiful wife, young daughter, and just buying the house in <br /> <br /> want to see. <br /> And again, something is missing in his own interior happiness. Watch this movie to learn how it gets "involved" with dancing salons and secretly going to the <br /> <br /> lessons. Most of the dance characters are released from the traditional <br /> <br /> Japanese hierarchy in social structure. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this is in sharp contrast as Japanese society is structured and it's "place for everyone and everyone in its place" philosophy. <br /> <br /> The movie has many funny moments. The nearly 1,500 theater pieces were broken <br /> in spontaneous rhythms during much of the comedy time. This proves <br /> <br /> that comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two character characters funny. <br /> One can buy and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in Japan, or, you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how <br /> <br /> people in Japan grow in a fairly rigid structure of society. Watching the movie "Are We Dansu?" is a quick immersion in further study and other look <br /> <br /> Japanese movie. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's good, it's going to make you cry a little, and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
