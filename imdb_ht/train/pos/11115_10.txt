I believe that Sopranos are an awesome show because of all the characters supported by it. I bought all the videos so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best one is definitely Episode # 3, Refusal, Wrath, Accept. This episode deals with my favorite characters of all time in the Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filon. He was killed to hijack the truck and accidentally kill a truck driver. Brendan was scared because he was actually one of the few characters that actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up getting injected into the eye while taking a bath, and that's my favorite scene ever in the story of the Sopranos. Brendan Filon is # 1 for me. And # 2 my favorite character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after attempting to kill Mr Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney Park after catching up with his torture. My # 3 favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed after being shot by Christopher. And finally, my favorite character # 4 is Chucky Signore, one of Junior's uncle henchmen. She died on a boat by Tony. All awesome characters are dying. This is the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool men still kill. You know what would be great to change on the Sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead characters they support in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio, and Paulie, because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone must knock back !!!!!!!!! 1
