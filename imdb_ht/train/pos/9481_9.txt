Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year he has been shooting but also now. It is a non-demo art film in the 21st century. The director holds a good narrative skill and thus makes the story so smooth! The movie reminds me of the new French movie new wave: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a Cote" which is in the same subject.
