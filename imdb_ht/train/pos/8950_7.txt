For the person you are familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of her "younger" films from later on in her career. And, while it is not a big movie compared to many of his other photographs, it's not bad and it's a decent time-tense - but not much more. Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some reason inexplicable, she decided to throw a spell on poor Jimmy to make her fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and tear off Mrs. Novak also began to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the witch's bookbook, this is a definite NO, NO !! The movie is odd in its sensitivity to the witches. They are neither baby sacrifices nor variety of all powerful. Most of the magic are very limited and pointless (like Jack Lemmon using his power to turn the street lamp). And, very strange, the witches all seem to be Bohemians who hang out from hip bars where you could find people carrying berets and listening to crappy jazz. Consider what I think of jazz, it must really feel for a witch in this movie world! Anyway, this movie is very romantic and legendary comedy, but not something I would hurry to watch. The act is very good, but the script does not offer enough rules to do this an outstanding movie - in fact, I almost scored the movie a 6 - it's really closed.
