I bought the DVD in this version to compare the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, which adapted Tinker Tailor spyware for television and died this year (2005). I remember great acting, especially in Rigg and Elliott, and music moving. (Music in 2005 version is far more understated, but very hard.) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's companion, not Esther. Esther did not have any uncle. Charlie Drake has never played Krook in a version, nor has he played Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by Johnny Vegas comedy in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> Both the adorable and admirable versions of the great Dickens' novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and the sentimentality can make you wince at times, but I challenge you not to cry - and laugh!
