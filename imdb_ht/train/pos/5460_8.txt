Have he noticed that if he wants to get any higher he gave the guys what they want.And what people want is it ... well, you know. Alfred E.Green's Baby Face (1933) is a film of high sexual content. For a movie in that era, anyway.This was one of the latest pre-Code films.Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily. Other actors in this film include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico) .Jan John Wayne sees it as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie deals with a brave and good topic. Infant figures are historically significant movie and therefore good to look.
