Keeping all political views aside, Feroz Khan and Gandhi Anil Kapoor, my father is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused side towards the Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi family, and the battle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi and society, older-than-life father, and most importantly demons in his head. One draws Gandhi's father in the nation and writes any son can have with their daddy <br /> <br /> The act is a good thing. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna-strictly in that order- adds color and pathos to this wrench heart attack in Harilal who cry to be embraced just once and also run away from the faintest touch of the finger. / / Feroz Khan's direction and fabrication are lavish and attractive, however, the scenario could have been tightening. I saw the play a few years ago on a DVD video type thief (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and was certainly more attracted. Though, the film's background notes and father-son and mother-child moments are just a brilliant treat. <br /> <br /> This movie could be great. It's brordline. It had the potential so great they were just a difference gap between a father or son or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere, the plot loses and when you expect absolute outburst of emotions, nothing comes to you. It compares Gandhi's other conscience. Certainly not an overview movie like Gandhi Kingsley, or abstract as Heal Ram Kamal Hassan. The movie just about managing to find its footing; However, one is surprised "that if ..." Worth a look. 7.5 / 10
