I went to see Antone Fisher does not know what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. The work acting by Derek Luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent. Naturally Denzel Washington has done his usual job of acting as well as directing. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can help with this movie is a perfect example of this. Do not miss this one.
