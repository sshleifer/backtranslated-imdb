Brother and psychokinetic power (yes, really) duel not only for Debra Winger's affection but really about a secret from childhood leaving at odds over power .. There are surreal touches (fire brigades that act as a chorus song Greek), but there are also humor and romance. The soundtrack is great just as the American Werewolf Way in London used all the great Wolf songs they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), putting his own trailer a Rockin 'in' It's a Woman '~ Priceless;) The Best Line Missing In The BTW section' Once you've got a clown, you're never back! <br /> <br /> I like this movie (I ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments are written by people who would be happier and legally blonde 3 do not put you off ~ give it a try :)
