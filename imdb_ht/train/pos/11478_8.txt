Chris and Andrew are two average, young ordinary. Some people do not misunderstand some other people. But together they stand and all pay. Together they form the "Army of Two". They plan with "Zero Day" plan. That day is when they decide high school storms and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. Told in the tape that they made "Zero Day", it is barely a fictional story of the Columbine Tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will mess with yourself later. The main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andrew Keuck) make such a great job that the characters seem like almost any teenage disenfranchised walk on the street. Their performance was very credible, or just loved the guys and what was frightening. Video shot is almost totally out of teenage perspective of "Zero Day" feels very real and authentic, as you are right there. These children try to streamline the actions of the viewer and the actors selling it to you. But they must warn him of following the tragedy from beginning to end and ending making shocking and uncomfortable for some.
