I saw this little Belgian gem of days after seeing 'Teen Americans'. Make no mistake about it, adolescence is a roller coaster ride, be it Indian or European. 'Naissance of Pieuvres' (or as it was called in the US Lillies Water) is a story of a 15 year old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who at times looks like a young Scarlett Johansson) acting freely, removes The girl wants to be in school swimming school, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more attractive than Florian. Face among all this is Marie's rather fatty, unattractive friend, Anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age. Along the way, we are showing the usual array of childhood distractions (broken heart, luggage stores, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a little quiet movie that takes time to work it in the way of your system (Michael Bay fans, take note: the rhythm here is slow, so steer clear), but if you have no problem with that Water Lillies is a chic. No rating here, but would pull down a hard "R", due to language, nudity, adult status.
