For me too, this Christmas special is one that I remember very lovingly. In 1989, I recorded the 2 CDs I found in the soundtrack recording, giving one of my sisters and keeping the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I would like to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as I listen. <br /> It was noted elsewhere that John Denver had made a number of appearances on the Muppet show, and made more than one special set. The good deal between Denver and his soft companions comes in clearly here, in a good and fun show that is good for all ages.
