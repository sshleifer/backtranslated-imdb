The only reason that I did not give this star 10 was DVD format-no menu, extras, etc. However, if you ever had a dream to do something with your life, this movie is for you . If you believe in yourself and your dreams do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-affirming films that I've ever seen. And magic. The act is superb, the sketch serves the purpose, and the sequence of the opening is fantastic. This is one of those films that "cult" status used to be on. I recommend this movie to all my friends. Some love it, some can not end it. Every time I think, or feel, something is impossible to think about Alan Arkin's role in this movie. Be sure to make more movies.
