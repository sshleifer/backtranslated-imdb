Very interesting and moving documentary on the tragedy of the World Trade Center on 11th September 2001 .The main theme of it is the heroic of American fire-fighter who tried to rescue many people as they could. The film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many who have seen on screen have lost their lives! Recommended.
