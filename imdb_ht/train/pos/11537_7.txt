Neil Simon has a talent for dialogue and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK Lemmon as opposing the quality of the ODD couple - a mixture of comedy and sadness that relies entirely on the credibility of two friends like unbalanced an apartment. Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar, curious about suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctance to agree to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) and a bit disastrous outcome. It seems that everything Felix says and Oscar drives up the wall and no one can stand the other way, and Oscar knows the Messenger Messenger imaginable and the exact opposite Felix. <br /> <br /> Funniest scene for me was when the sister Pigeon giggling in the apartment above was visiting a dinner date. Priceless interactions between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans are enough to put you in stitches. Sister Pigeon Sisters are the gals who have made their voices for the Gabble Sisters (a pair of kings) at Disney's ARISTOCAT, and here - the funny distractions of Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to turn the movie into hilarity - where it remains much of the time. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Neil Simon and enjoy other screen treatments at her work, this one is not to be missed. Matthew and Lemmon are perfectly thrown (even though they considered exchanging role before filming began), and, of course, it's easy to see why it became a higher-rated television show later on. Simon comedy, not to be missed.
