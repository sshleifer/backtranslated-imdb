I found this movie to be good. I thought the characters were developing since I was watching, I found myself caring about these people. This is a piece of period that I believe took place during the depression. A single mother, who is known as the town stuck (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the paper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-connoisseur who is in town looking for work. She saw the announcement and she went out to see her. He hired him. I really had some chuckles as their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in the shoes. Everything went on this matter in reality. She needs the job so she does not want to upset her. And he needs his help, but he does not want him to get the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they start really need each other. Things start to warm up until ...... the big blowup. I'm not going to spoil it by telling you what's going on. But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found the story to be very credible for the time it takes place. I think this is one of the best "relationships" stories out there. Perhaps the younger generation will not "get it" but if you are over 40 I think you'll love it. But if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time" you will love it in this one too.
