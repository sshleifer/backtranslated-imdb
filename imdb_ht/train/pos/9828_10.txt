I'll be honest with you ... I loved this movie. It's a great zombie cops packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but also is packed with the effects of evil zombie. Part IV, called "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this Should Check Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Massage Party, Sleepy Kill Camp, and Other Full Moon Photo Flicks .
