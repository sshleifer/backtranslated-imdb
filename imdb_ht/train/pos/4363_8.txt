She is a little baffled to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this movie is where Gig has received his name, and also a good career strengthening after playing a small part under another name. <br /> I will go against the majority of other comments and states that I really enjoyed this movie, especially because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. It was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring, and celebrity as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during the War I. War The "man" of the house, Fiona stood firm for years against solving his father's will that would therefore allow a kind of Trump Donald named Charles Barclay to find the family home. But Fiona holds a secret as to why he hates Barclay much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle sister, who is married to an Englishman but craves her younger sister (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwyck fan, this is a no miss.
