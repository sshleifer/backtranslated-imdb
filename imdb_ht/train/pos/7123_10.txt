Sometimes I watch a movie and I'm really impressed by it ?? and it is always easy to explain why I loved it very much. This is especially true for the uncommon movies ?? The ones that one can hardly compare to the rest are out. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special movies. There are a lot of emotions in that movie ?? and the act was so good that while watching the movie, I was crying and laughing as the story went on. Young Nick Robinson is a young (William) evacuated from London because of the hit when there during the Second World War. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man left in the village of evacuated children. At first Tom refuses to take any responsibility - such as caring for a little scared boy? but accepted since it is left without a choice. During the stay Mr. Tom discovered how terrible the life was for the William ?? along with his luggage his mother sent a belt and written instructions to the army of his son ?? Do not hesitate to use it. This is berri belt in the garden ?? Never be used in a brutal manner. Mr. Tom gives a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, went to school, made new friends and discovered hidden talents. All of a sudden a letter William is called home in London with a letter mentioned that he does not feel quite ?? and it starts all over again? only this time it gets worse There are many feelings you can sense in this movie ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another chef in British movies comparable only to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if one is compared. I really enjoyed watching it, it's highly recommended. Before finishing this review I would also like to mention Thomas Thomas's great performance in the role of Zac ?? remind me of a friend from my own child (:
