For starters, I did not even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I've never seen it on television before in my country, and a lot of people do not know about this show. It's a pity though, because this is the easiest and smartest animation I've witnessed in years. <br /> I do not but out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that really deserves all 10 points. Even at the first glance this might look like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spirit-animals, an old Indian believed to have been preserved for many years. This show shows in an original original that you can not often find in anime show. The overall design is also a very different thing. Sometimes, it looks like a little bit expressed in terms of frustrating design, and sometimes it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe that David Feiss has been created and directed cattle and chicken to host a segment of the show (as it also traces this segment of the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a self-twist show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss . Once you start watching, you are probably going to look at it in the end. A minor fact may be that the show takes on less material in the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?
