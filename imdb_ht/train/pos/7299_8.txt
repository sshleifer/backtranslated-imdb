Poor to throw, awful script full of holes, hot blonde gets alive, the evil scientist has a seriously nasty one, one man takes on a plot of guns that trains and outcomes, the special terrible effects, they fix the problem by blow the head over the monster ... Awesome. The only thing missing a graphic sex scene needed during one of the killings. Haha. Good gored up full fun with twisting predictable and ridiculous covering. I really enjoy this movie, but before you look it sure you are in for a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I can not, in my right mind, think that this film has been made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way that it is meant to be enjoyable. Very simply. So get some popcorn with a couple beer and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. She brought some joy to my life.
