This film was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the Gold Scale. Write beautiful and right, nominated for the Independent Spirit award, looking at Ruby's day in day life. What we see is a slice of the life of Ruby's young woman. Ashley Judd (Sister) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Leader for This Role. Ruby will begin to live on its own and establish its own identity. She explores work, friends, boyfriends, sex, a typical grown-up teen research. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Film Film Festival Sundance. As an independent movie enthusiast I chose the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this kind of movie, because it does not bring the luggage to Hollywood. Although the stories are completely different this reminds me of the fool Nobody, setting Paul Newman. The film later is a slice of the daily life of a common person. I like that. The story is very nicely said, and all we did was sitting and enjoying the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are many many bugs, and flies in paradise as there is in Florida. As I have allergies to mosquitos, Florida has no paradise for me, and I am feeling all over Florida. I turn into a complete red bouquet. I recommend this movie! Favorite Styles: Ruby and his friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the beach in Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite Quotes: "Necessity has always been a good excuse." "All that tune on finding someone is not at all different now, who will be and when and why."
