Love shows this ... smart acting, intelligent dialogue, great storyline and real people .... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I love the idea of ​​six sessions ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Run yourself in these stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance to bring it back. Not grovel .. But please! When it came to the air, I watched online and loved how I could watch it with minimal interruption, in fact, ABC online made it easy to enjoy watching when you missed them over the first time ... are the days of endless formwork. Whenever you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
