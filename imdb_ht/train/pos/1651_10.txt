I watched this presentation on PBS in the U.S. when it was originally revealed in 1988 (?). Suppose the ministers were available on DVD I bought the first edition of all three books last year. Since then I have been looking for the series on web movie sites. Today I get this website. I'll give up the search. <br /> I also want to buy this complete - 26 episodes - mini. After buying the DVDs I would read every book, then watch the episodes for this book. This is what I did with Karla John LeCarre's trilogy and the Texas trilogy Texas Larry McMurty. Anyone have any suggestions for big books or books that have become very good TV miniseries - or movie series - which are now available on DVD?
