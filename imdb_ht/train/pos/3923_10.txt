This is an amazing movie, both for the extreme energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing, and the unique way that the films interrupt the story of the stage production and the lives of the characters are preparing for it. Spell is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not the 'Carmen Bizet' by any normal standard. This is not a normal movie by any standard. Each look of nuances, each stomp in the foot, each piece of music is tied so captivatingly that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to like opera or flamenco (not) to be captured, enraptured, enthralled by this movie. Subtle and direct; loud and still; One, if not the best, movies in his style, because some like it.
