That's a Casper Ghost Friendship short of my childhood, and I re-view it on YouTube (Thank God! For Your Tube); after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts. <br /> I like the brief how to start in spooky with Frank Gallop's anxiety; until we get to see Casper sitting by her tomb in the cemetery reading. While every ghost got up from the graves of "boo" people, Casper decided to leave in search of a friend. But in trying to make a friend, anyone sees Casper running away. Poor Casper sitting on a bottle and crying; until a little fox gets a nodule. Casper and the little fox quickly bail to him quickly name the young Ferdie and consider him to be his best friend. Casper and Ferdie's relationships put in great danger but however when Casper does not keep a blind eye on Ferdie while playing a game of hide and seek. While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie are running as fast as possible until it is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is shooting shots towards Ferdie Casper's notice trying to kill him, he flies toward the hunter and complains that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and dogs are terrified by Casper. Casper crys to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie's body by moving and wondering if it is OK. When Casper saw Ferdie died he began to grieve in pain because he lost "the only friend he had ever been in his life." Casper returned back to the cemetery where he buried Ferdie and made a great tomb for him next to the Casper tomb. Casper continues to grieve in pain until she sees that Ferdie was resurrected as a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on her cheek. Casper shouts for joy because he was meeting with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a really good one; even though disturbing mostly, showing the death of a family-oriented drawing.
