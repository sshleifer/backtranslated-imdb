I feel Monarch Cove being one of the best writers and acting out the "Series" Series to come across any network in a long time. This show was great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a major Primitive Soap. People are looking forward to this kind of act as we were "over TV reality" overkilled. I have time for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Landing Knots', Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. giving. Monarch Cove updated this concept well and I anticipate it only getting better. There's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and fascinating in their own right. It would be a loss by exploring this and developing these characters after it has drawn and tuned us into their world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensuous without going further or offending. Love it.
