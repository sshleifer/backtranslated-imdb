I really love this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool, not to intimidate soldiers who do not want to go to war. His personality is similar in a Yossarian style of Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel on men and wars. This film, however, does not include a war zone, but in a pre-war combat preparation preparation. This wonderful movie is all about achieving the disease that the Vietnam War was a mistake and people who were set to sacrifice sacrifices for a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who has shown as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he was disdainful and irreverent to the establishment who tried to kill him. Bozz is totally cool and non-plussed, testing and tweaking its superior military, getting the goats in every opportunity. It is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree of psychology, "saving" his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need, the way out of this man's army. <br /> <br /> The action and action is dry and credible And as a "Sleeper", Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Jacket as one of the top three Vietnamese films in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Five Star, a top pick.
