In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the sound of Hollywood's sounds tried to distance themselves from the flag's intelligence that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "The Best Years of Our Life" and even the 'Gentleman's Agreement' investigated the American way to watch themselves in the wake of war, but Delmer Daves' "pride of the navy" defeated them. The film is about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as a sailor and after a nightmare in a foxhole, and Japanese heroic hero called out to her and her buddies "Mariiines, tonight you die!", It is clogged by a hand-grenade, and his girlfriend's home back home rather than to depend on it after coming home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is compromising in his illustrations about the brave guys, as it was, almost no coincidence they are, in the foxhole, and when they shoot at them, they react So much for courage, but to get the job done .. Then comes the self-pity, the dark, gloomy sense of humor. in his blindness and the film makes no excuse, "There is no free candy for anyone in this world", as his friend told him. Amy guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him, "In a war of one who gets it, and you're reading. Everyone got trouble! When I come back, some guys will not hire me because no I'm Diamond ". <br /> <br /> Movie films are made with intestines like these, and if the first half hours of 'pride of the Marines' do not rise to the occasion completely, since then it evolved into a true work of art .. You cry, and you meditate, you hurt, and hope to hope. Well, simply: art.
