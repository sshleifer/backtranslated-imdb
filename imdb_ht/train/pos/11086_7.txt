I saw this movie when I was little - He called "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized by her! She followed a lovely little family fox around. The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the foxes. I also remember my mother bring me out of the theater while I was in hysteria. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say it does not end up well for all the foxes. I used the Disney feature film type where animals do not really die. Oh people. This movie makes me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really little and truth told-all I remember was being happy for the fox and then seeing one of them dying. Rent it if you can, but do not show your kids!
