"Life Stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are still present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always, and the other worker is fine too. This movie has some Capra taste, and that's why it's so good. There are some unforgettable gaps like the one when Brooks tries to earn some money dancing on the street, and everyone who does not just ignore it, or when it meets a crazy funny man who believes Paul Getty and then begins discuss and tackle with each other. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, you do not know what you were missing. <br /> This movie tells us about the old struggle with the eternal poverty against the rich. <br /> <br /> The difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and reality has not. <br /> <br /> Yes indeed, life stinks.
