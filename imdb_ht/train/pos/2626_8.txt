"King Lion 1 1/2" is most commonly not released in Disney. Recently I've seen this movie again after seeing it in many years. I remember the first time I saw it I did not have any expectations at all and was surprised to be jolly watched by this watchable and very funny movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than the "Pride of the Simba"? In many ways, yes. Though the "Pride Simba" was not exactly bad, he suffered some problems: lacking a good script and bad characterization, which made the impact of something else an okay movie. <br /> In every way: It's nice to see Timon and Pumbaa's personality bloom again in the way that we (or certainly me) loved about them in this movie; The "Pride Simba" was completely annoying and I did not like the series "Timon and Pumbaa" nor. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be a stupid one, but fortunately the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and rather focused to make this movie at very hilarious times. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is quite good. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, Timon Child, (voiced by Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, which is enjoyable. Friendship between Timon and Pumbaa are touchingly described. Emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which he can easily do (especially in comedies). But what has distracted this picture from receiving 10 votes from me? Yes, there. Although they are fortunately not too much impact, but I'll mention them: 1. Many of the scenes from the first movie are used in this one. Personally, it was strange to see the old scenes integrated with these new ones. <br /> 2. During the climax, some of the jokes are becoming lame. History, this is Timon's story and although the filmmakers attempt to integrate his story with the Simba, he makes the movie feel a little running at times. <br /> But hey, these details do not affect this otherwise funny movie. It's only really acceptable Disney's end, which should be in every movie collection.
