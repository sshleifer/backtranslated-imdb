This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse of the lives of the brave women of Cameroon's judicial system - policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite great difficulty - lack of means, desperate poverty in the people, many languages ​​and several legal precedents depends on the region of the country and the background of religious / ethnic plaintiffs and defendants - these brave, strong women are doing a difference. <br /> This is something rare - a really inspiring film that restores a little bit of faith to mankind. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is justified thanks to those fascinating, hardworking women. I only hope this film gets a wide drop in the United States. The more people who see this movie, the better.
