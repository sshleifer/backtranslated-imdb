I'm surprised that no one yet mentioned that there are two versions of this movie. The lion's part of the foot of both is identical, but here are different places: In one version (the version I've seen most often on TV broadcasts), the group of clerics guarding the gate consists of the "Brotherhood protection ", a (fictional) Splinter group of priests and brothers" excluded "by the Church. In the other version, which I saw only once on television, the clerics guarded the gateway to the priesthood of the official church, ie the Archdiocese in New York (or maybe Brooklyn). Also, in the ancient version, in most of the important scenes, the clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the mouths say "Daddy" so-and-so but the audio Armed said so-and-so brothers. In the latter version, I believe everyone is referred to as "Father." In any event, it seems that one of the two versions is more or less part of the re-shoot at the other, and the "Protective Fraternity" scenes are re-shot as "Archdiocese", or vice versa. (Kind of reminders to Raymond Burr scene in "Godzilla") There was video in both versions of TV broadcasts, so no, I do not imagine this .. Does anyone shed some more light on the story behind the two versions of the movie?
