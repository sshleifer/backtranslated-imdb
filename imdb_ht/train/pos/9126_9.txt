This movie is exceptional and beautiful notes. The Oscar Prince for music was richly deserved (many people did not know he was one). I think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A great surprise: Prince does a good job acting, and it is very good to transmit pain on camera. Morris Days, Wendy, and Lisa are good at supporting them. Many cool movie cinemas.
