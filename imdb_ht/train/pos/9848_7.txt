I watched this movie with my child's eyes, and I was not disappointed. The story is well-known, some abandoned orphans must be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mammoth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy beast) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredible little animal anger and his hazenut. This one really makes me laugh very much during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Shortly, it works, it's funny and it's a "must-see" with your kids (they'll love it).
