It's not too bad movie aboard, and Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we could either with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint. Get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from the Urbane plain, killing and being murdered - still a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie's a hard-boiled dummy from avenging and clearing his father framed and dying, a police detective in planning and carrying out with his coterie a matter of assassination thousands. Which would surely have had the opposite effect! Sanders joining the fun simply does not dance to the right club at the right place in the right town at the right time and the right lighting falls on both of him and the first killer (at the right time!) And kills him '. <Brr /> <br /> The story and the OK act, the only hunger I've had is near the end and the discovery is rushed and almost discouraged in what the evil genius (Waldeman) was - they were almost forgot about its importance in the plot? That said, a solid entry in the series.
