In one year of pretentiousness such as "Synecdoche, New York" a film made from Charlie Kaufman's self-indulgence, comes a movie that is the same hard to look, but about three times as important. "Frownland" is a work of love by the crew, actors and filmmakers, shooting over years by friends. It draws a man who can not communicate in his really authentic world, real world Brooklyn. The people that you see are a step beyond the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own neurosis, wanting to change, can. The real world is their own set of hallucinations and because this is a movie about who they are, so profoundly out of touch, it's very hard to look. It is 16mm film-made without proper light, money or any of the other factors that would make a movie "Slick", but its honesty can not be understated, a fact that would cause a full room of people to reject it and for Richard Linklater giving him a prize as he did in SXSW. This reminds films such as "naked" or better in the "mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to look and grow on you the longer you think about it.
