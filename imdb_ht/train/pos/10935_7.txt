Well, I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie. Despite the fact that the doubling was very cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for any apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually very interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan has to draw down the other five members and discover that among them are using their skills for evil, and who use them for good. Catching that being during training, all of the family was masked, and all had since returned to society to disguise and rename their names. <br /> <br /> The fights are a joy to watch, as each member of the Clan poison has a different style different: my favorite frog The fighting scene has the actors jumping all over the place, and fortunately the camera remains planted and uses a paycheck to find out all the action. <br /> <br /> The single disadvantage of the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up to the first battalion sequence. But stick with it, and you will not be disappointed!
