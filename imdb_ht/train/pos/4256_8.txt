Like a fun movie! Very warm heart. One can not help fall in love with the character of Gigi. She is adorable as a child and grows in a sensitive art. The whole movie revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world ?? living all life ?? curiosity, desires and anticipation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory but really stays in the shadow of his whole life. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so the mother. I wanted the dad to come and meet with the mom at the last stage ?? and make them cry and laugh. I also hope that at least something was redeemed on the grandfather. His personality seems to have been trashed entirely. Passion and Judge? That's the key to life. And looking at the camera ?? focus on detail and seduce the delicate details of life.
