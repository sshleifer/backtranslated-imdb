I recently rented the animated version of the Lord of the Rings on video after seeing FANTASTIC 2001 action shares live in the movie. The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be far better than George Lucas' Star Wars "prequel" trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will never be like the real movie movie series in the 21st Century! > <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I did not quite understand the depth of the movie at that time. Now that I have read the books, I understand what the entire scenario is all about. For sure, some of the characters are quite funny, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) But I said he followed the book rather well and it goes to a part of the two books, the two towers. The good things are that the action is a bit interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it in time. The bad things are that it ends half imbalances of the two towers without any result of Frodo's quest to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks well-dated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> In general, not as bad as many say it is. But the 2001 actual live version is the new feature of the Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we could at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter! I'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter any day! <br /> A 7 out of a scale of 1-10, away from LESS violent than the 2001 action version, but now close as good! For diehard fans of the books and movie versions of the Lord in the Rings.
