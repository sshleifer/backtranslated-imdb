Personally, I remember Jerry Springer's show, however, I found "Ringmaster" to be the funniest movie I've seen this year. The never-ending satire of Jerry Springer "invited" starts at the opening stage to keep you laughing at the movie. Despite a short scene in which Jerry Springer made a weak attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for absolute entertainment.
