I bought the video rather late in collecting me and probably would have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. It consistently supersedes another of these "moon cosmos" night. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve the awards but this is really a perfect performance ensemble of a superb movie. What? You do not know what a "cosmo moon" is?
