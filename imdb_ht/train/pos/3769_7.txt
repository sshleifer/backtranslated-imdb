Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy of me. I thought it was absolutely hyperlink. One of the best movies I've seen. <br /> Now it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoyed "Excellent Adventure", you should be more likely to have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "dude, where is my car?". Only this one is actually funny. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one, you should love "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. For fun only, watch it, let go, and remember it's a comic comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
