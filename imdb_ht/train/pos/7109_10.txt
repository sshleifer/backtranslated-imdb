First, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are great, bulging wholes in the story line and raised questions that will nowhere near being answered; 2) The film is not for everyone, so watchers watching over will get restless and start yapping during the movie. The point of the above is important because the film is very quiet. In an older kind of theater (like one I went to), you can hear the coil going to the projector at times. I liked it. The film does not keep you busy with music or effects: it allows you to reflect on what's happening. There is a lack of rhythm that generates a fascinating atmosphere. Even the kind of atmosphere produced by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide closed. Not for everyone. <br /> I would highly recommend it to fans of movies, as the cinematic work is amazing. Those who base their appreciation to a movie only on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's kind of history that you have to make up the links to your mind afterwards. (My version of it is very darn cool, but probably well off-track!) If you go to catch the movie, there is one very cool part: when the two cops talk to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you at the time. Hats on those who thought of doing so.
