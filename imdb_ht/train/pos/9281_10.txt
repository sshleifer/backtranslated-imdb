I do not know how and where the Iranian directors get their inspiration to come up with a plot like this. In fact, it is a very simple scheme that many directors could come up with-but can not be able to project on a Jafar Panahi's way of film. The film is like 2 world revolutions at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the fight between gender that will be behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> It makes you feel like you are in the movie, You're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you'd like to have a glimpse into the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings like those female actors in the movie. It's anxious in such a way that you want to see the finish, you'll want to find the verdict, you will die to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> I love the conversations intermittently between the smoking girl and one of the military trainees. It's like Venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in thinking of men and women and women struggles to get equal rights and opportunities especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. This is the second film of Jafar Panahi that I saw (first being Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to watching some more. <br /> <br /> I'm already wired with Iranian cinema and this one is a must-see!
