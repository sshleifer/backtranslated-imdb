"GEORGE LOPEZ," in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I have not seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) walked into a car moving piece. If you want to know why, you'll have to see it for yourself. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that everyone still gives a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was still very strong. In conclusion, even if new episodes can now be seen, I recommend you catch it just in case it goes into the air for good.
