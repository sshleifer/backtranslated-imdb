In all Arnold's 80's noodles' movie that would be the most important thought today would be the Man Run. A cool and amazing reality reality in television reality goes crazy. It may have been far-fetched back then, but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, TV shows show them either scratch the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one is not more controversial than the last, it's a dude. How long will it be before we really see show like the Running Man? How long before we have 'court theater attorneys' or entertainment divisions at the Department of Justice? There are many satire and intelligence in this film that could be missed back in 1987 that are desperate to be seen again considering the current state of television shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media say they believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless the most accurate representation of truth comes from us we can easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that TV reality is not really realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being revealed and it's just what the networks want you to see. Usually it is far away from the real truth. Although rather different than the Stephen King's book (the completely completely changed) script conforms to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, it has been very and very unrealized One-Matter that covers and says 'I'll be back' (which he never really said is often anyway, when you think about it) to the most ironic situation again , but it's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would be (these two were considered BEVORE Arnie believe he or not). The director is no other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but still strong enough to generate excitement and usage with flowers and flowers to each person wearing a very cool look. Andrew Davis (not a principal favorite director) was attached to Glaser, though no directors, the film is still hurt by feeling a lot of the 80's. <br /> <br /> First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's note (note it?) is incredibly dated and depicts the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the essence of the movie film is far too much to be compelling put in the future. Apart from the related dates, the only other thing my bug is wrong to shoot-out scenes that pass as the climax. This new DVD is once better than the original release. Gone is the picture of mosquito mosquito. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85: 1 anamorphic transfer. Colors are bright and literally pop out of the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES Soundtrack are also amazing. Constant use of the channels has surrounded the great effects and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I've seen too far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'encounter the Stalkers gadgets' are included in this 2-disc series that comes in a slip case rather well.
