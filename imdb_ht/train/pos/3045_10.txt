This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is the laugh is never stopped. The plot is an even old story the same old thing where children are separated from the mother who kills everything for his homework - and a happy reunion to the end. There are bandits (Ranjit) and have brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and have vixens (Parveen Babhi) and have lovers (Smita Patil) and have a blind brother and a grandfather cast in for good measure. But this film is about Amitabh and all of you remember at this end. Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living with his dialogue delivery and the hilarious hobbies. Later in the movie she gets into the angry Young Man she is famous for but the humor remains. Memorable parts include his walk, speaking and speaking English, this song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> All in all I've rolled and laughed at all the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh's absolute best - this is it. It will be easy to give it a 10/10.
