If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are missing if you have not seen this movie again. This film is crazy hilarious, and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody film ... It's unfortunate that this movie has not been released on DVD because it's one movie that everyone I've ever watched him and loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers, definitley rent this movie. There is plenty of video rental locations with copies, but if you come to one you will not be disappointed.
