THE LOVE OF THE TOP - The American title is utterly harmless for the French movie "Le Mouton Enrage" (which means, I think, the Shepherd Lamb) - is such an original movie, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more surprising . This film was far ahead of its time; even at the highest level today, it accomplishes something that looks rich and new. Filmed by the director of the confusionist Michel Deville, he challenged the description of the way he combines social criticisms, comedies, mysteries, love, sex and satire into one completely original mix - leaving for the end a great but subtle surprise to render all that was Go before suddenly sadness and more understanding. Throw is splendid, dith writing and theme. But it's delicious Deville's tone, keeping you constantly off-balance but enraged, which pushes this "lost" movie to a very high level indeed. (The interview written with the director on "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)
