Well, this movie is about Bedknobs and broomsticks, it's one of the best, delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid. It's the unforgettable film about two growns and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun. It can slightly refuse to look, but try it, I neither my mother did not think it was bad, I was very enthused with the movie and the animation, all were well. It is a wonderful beautiful comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even children. Age 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful, comedy music with you and your family especially the animation. The animation movements and how are they really nice and deserve a thumb. It's a very terrific music for the whole family so what are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent beds and broomsticks right now.
