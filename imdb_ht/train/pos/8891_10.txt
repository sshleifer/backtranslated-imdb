I can agree with other comments that there was not an enormous amount of history discussed in the film but it was not a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think he did a very good job in it. <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes were gathered out of place. Like all of a sudden it would be thrown away by getting caught in the story and the connections between families later on and finding it very good. Although it was not a re-deduction of the 60s he brought to light the very large and significant landmark of the decade. I found it very fun and worth while looking.
