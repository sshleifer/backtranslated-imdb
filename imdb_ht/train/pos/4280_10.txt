The group of people is traveling to Belgrade in a terrible bus led by a drinking drinker and his dumb son (who likes driving with his eyes closed). Travel is often interrupted by many hilarious events that have a lot of history describing the fall of the nation's spirits in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common joke. Those who "steal the show" are a 4-foot peasant and 4 son-in-law who are almost twice as bigger. In the end, the movie takes a single dramatic turn and the trip gets nothing but a Swan `s song in a dead country.
