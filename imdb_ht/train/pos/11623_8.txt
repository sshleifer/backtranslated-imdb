(You'll know what I mean after you've seen red eyes ...) <br /> Overall, Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller. It gets off at a slow start, and slowly is building. But by the time it was over, it's a rider! <br /> It's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as ... typing as I found it. Except that, simply put, the director did a job credited to pull you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill draw. I prefer to forget about watching a movie. It says so much. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are "closeness" of victims and bad guys ... and that over time you begin to really deal with the victim. A scant 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
