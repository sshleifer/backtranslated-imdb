One of the best movies out there. Yeah maybe the cinematography was not the greatest, but an excellent draw with concepts. Great for the time and bright and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and great fun. One of my favorites and would recommend anyone who loves creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fight in gigantic robots, the actors have given a great performance and make it all worth while. The compositions are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a great view and lots of fun.
