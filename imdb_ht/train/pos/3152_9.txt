This show was absolutely great, and I always looked forward to watching it. All the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode gave laughs that did not stop, and it was completely fun and different from a lot of other shows .Everyone was just crazy and breathtakingly funny, that you could not help but love this show. There was a few dead weight episodes, but that 70 'shows still managed to create some kind of resembling atmosphere , in which it just really didn the problem. This was one of the best shows ever to be revealed, and I'll watch this show whenever I can, so it never gets old, never become unfunny, and never become refreshing.
