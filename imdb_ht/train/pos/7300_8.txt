Like the gentle giants that make half of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has favor, but it's also slow and ponderous. The last producer of producers, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow manage it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Madness was read in animatronix, which is always fun when faced with wonderful worlds under the sea's surface. But even that was only beams. Poor focus on some performing scenes looks like amateur. With dolphins and candles, the technology is all but wasted. Scenes and too many pre-ups in the giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of the stunning 3D IMAX capability. There are too many scenes in any depth or variety. Close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there are often only one animal in the camera field, so there is no integer contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got Shark-Week on Cable, its intermediate treatment and its substance is a constant deception.
