I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never watch it after that. The other day I was babysitting and cousin I never saw all the dogs going to heaven to rent both movies and watch them together today and he really likes these movies. So many memories come back to watch this movie once again and I must admit I even call a little. I'm 22 years old and the finish always gets me. All the dogs going to heaven are one of the most touched animated films and I'm shocked honestly by this rating at 5.8, I thought this movie would bring back good memories to others too. I admire the animation was a bit typical but the story is just for good and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog that is killed by another gambling dog, carb. But when Charlie wants to revenge him back on Earth with a look that can not stop ticking or ending his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for surfaces and spy on him to find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who speaks to animals and finds that which will be to win the races. Charlie took the girl, Ann-Marie, and made false promises in order to get the money. But she finished learning that maybe she should wear Ann-Marie first before herself when Carface goes back with her with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> All dogs go to heaven is the perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but this is an excellent family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's just so nice and touchy. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have soul. How could they not? They're just for love, and I think I'll cry again. But anyway, I would just recommend that movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> 7/10
