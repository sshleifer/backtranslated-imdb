Eye Red is a good little relationship to watch on a Saturday night. Large stocks, great cruelty and unexpected actions. Some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short minute and 88% of the movie is on an airplane and just talking. Do not worry they pull it very well with the intelligent and witty dialogue. <br /> A movie PG-13 seems to be the new reason for the creator of Wes Craven. But surely enough he was to fit as much violence as he could possibly enter this comedy. <br /> This movies most points is its cast. This movie needed good actors to deliver the dialogue and emotions. If they did not have people the movie actor would be lost and boring. We were Rachel McAdams from girl mean and wedding crater. Cillian Murphy from Batman begins with 28 days later. Round of this throw is Brian Cox from X-men. <br /> Rally in this movie was great. Just when your thinking it will get boring to throw a twist at you. Luckily this is not a long film and does not feel like it either. Much better then the flight plan in other flights. <br /> Here is my Flight Plan Comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby. <br /> 8/10
