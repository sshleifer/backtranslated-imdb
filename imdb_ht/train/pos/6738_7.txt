Where Sidewalk's end is quite a good drama film-drama dram drama and has been shot well in black and white and aside as well. <br /> A copper accidentally kills a mock who is suspected of murder and protects himself and covers this up and blames it on someone else he does not like has committed a lot of crimes in the past . But towards the end, she owns, but not before falling in love with a woman she meets who the lover of those he has killed ... <br /> <br /> Throw in includes Dana Andrews (While City Sleep, Curse of the Devil), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (Streets of San Francisco, Beyond Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens ( The deadly wonder). Good part at all. <br /> Where Sidewalk Ends Are Right If You Get The Chance. Excellent. <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
