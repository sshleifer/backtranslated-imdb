Nina Foch insisted that "My Name Is Julia Ross" in this film 1945 film also starred by Lady Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the movie is suffering. He could have been standing for a good fifteen minutes in half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing, Foch was a television device, playing a neurotic woman, the wife and husband cheating, the nervous dream. He became one of the great teachers acting in Los Angeles. Here, it is a nice genius playing the title role. Julia responded to an ad for a secretary and was immediately hired by Ms. Hughes and her son Ralph. Her little know - even if we learn immediately - that the work agent is a front, setting up finding the right woman for this placement, a woman with no family and no companion. <br /> It's a live situation; Once Julia came home, she's drugs, and when she wakes up, she says she is Ms. Hughes and is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The act is very good. Low budget but still fun - some things, particularly in the end, happen too fast, which is why I told the movie is too short. But I recommend it.
