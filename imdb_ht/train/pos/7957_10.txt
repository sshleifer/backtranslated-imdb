Hey guys, <br /> I was looking everywhere to find these two movies and I can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I am Australian). You might please help me and tell me where I can buy it. At Ward Home Ward 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie that I was 5 and still is even now when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. All my family loves this movie except for my younger sister because I watched her many times that she was sick of her. I love this movie and I can not wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> Sally
