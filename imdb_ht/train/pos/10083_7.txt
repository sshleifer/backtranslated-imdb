The fact that this film was put on DVD is still the format of television and a soft picture really annoys a lot of movie purists ...... and that's why. This deserves a better treatment. The story is on a street scene that needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and wind up with a girl instead (not the conventional way) .... and the problems that cause later. The old man bought the kid in a slave auction and soon discovered the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. "The old man" Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is the kind of funny-looking with a missing front teeth and an infectious grin.The girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cutie .. The rest of the story is how to manage afterwards .I usually love a handsome sentiment but this gets A bit carried away in the final 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's involving filling history with drama, thriller, humor and sadness. Just do not expect a good quality photo for the money you're spending on DVD. Until she widescreen, rent it.
