Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special way ways, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier gave lines still good story and performance, and they always wanted the errors they did . They advise people to see more episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The cast has a fantastic camaraderie and shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> The crowd of guest actors who make the marks on the show and fans attests also the show, as the story line goes out of force in force. The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and endemic mainstream - and these can rub a few people the wrong way, but this is what Star Trek is and it's all about. It shows these stories lines in a clever and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. <br /> Yes, they used some characters in trekking stories, but they did justice - characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, vastly underused at the show, had a rebirth of the New Frontier books, but they lost their sizzle After a while, when Peter David is more in the direction of wild fantasy against serious sci-fi, and HF displays these characters in a completely different light, which serves them better. The site also allows fans to communicate with chat rooms and forums and can get to know people involved. They drop bloated every episode, so fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people who make it in their spare time, with a dedication that would make many professional-wide Eyed Peasers in shock! <br /> What is this series, now drawing in a closed after 7 years, has been accomplished on such a limited amount of resources that have nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same . HF lives for a long time after it has ended, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.
