This movie is like a moving, amazing piece of work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 & did not really well "get it" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course & i now owned it) & was just hauling. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from the beginning to end. I've read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. The casting, acting, music, costume, scenery, everything, it's just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you applaud ... it carries out all imaginable emotions. it is one of her finest pieces of work & should not miss!
