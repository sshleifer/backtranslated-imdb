I've always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you've seen the cast, the act is superb and help make this movie move along pretty well. Cybill Shepherd gave great revision for his role and was well-deserved. Starting in this movie begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose photo-perfect wedding comes to a break when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot of life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth like Alex Finch's newborn (Robert Downey, JR). Alex goes on to live his new life for a while past while Corinne tries to get over and over. Here's the cross of Alex's path 23 years later when she meets Miranda's daughter Corvey (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and nasty situations happen.) It's great and the scenes are heart felt and very nice. You can not be ashamed if you give it a chance, Chances are you going to love it. Very funny and sweet!
