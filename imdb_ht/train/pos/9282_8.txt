In Iran, women are not admitted to football games. Officially is because they must be killed from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are the lowest forms of human beings. <br /> Some brave girl opposes this and try to get to the stadium using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage, until the police are coming and pick up them. Despite the crazy situation, this is a very humorous movie. It also encourages them to see how people always find different ways of fighting asthma. You will get touched at the same time as you have a lot of laughter. Good work by Jafar Panahi director. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
