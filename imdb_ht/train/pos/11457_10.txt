As the jacket proclaims, this film is "Gorgeously Shot and Masterfully edited," and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful. The timelessness that we see in stoic rock and the steady ebb and the flow of effervescent water frame from the Goldsworthy so that in many ephemeral are shown in eternity. So the beauty of her composition haunt us with just a touch of sadness in the knit - or in the words of Matthew Arnold from "Dover Beach": <br /> Listen! you hear the size of the grate of the pebbles that the waves draw back and throw, In the returns, the beam, Begin, and stop, and then again begin, With tremulous cavity slows, and brings the Note eternal of sadness. br /> <br /> At one point near the end of the movie Goldswill says "Words are done, but what I'm doing here says a lot more." As a mo I I take any offense and not for a moment I think it immodest because the combination of shape and time with changes and textures and colors and compositions that Goldsworthy passionate and intuitively create, is really something more than words can only say. <br /> At another point he noticed "What's here to stay ... and what not." That's her theme. <br /> I think art sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so began to reflect on this understanding by composing work that was spewed by ephemeral. The idea was, that does not emphasize how short live the same work most of men, should be a sense of the timelessness of art. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the efficiency of Goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression. It partially composed some straw or leaf form where the tide will reach it, or place it in the river where it will sweep away; and in this process is merging both the composition and its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Both the timeless and timeless transitions are needed to understand our world and our place in it. And it is important that such work must be done in the context of nature so that the compounds are set in what is natural. So the walls of stone and eggs in the stones that Goldsworthy construct are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but instead will remain for some indefinite length of time and then disappear and return to a state like that that existed before we came together. This art is as art should be, the analogous to the spiritual. <br /> In a Goldsworthy job is an inaccultural understanding. It is a purely experimenting time and form. In a sense the work of Shelley's famous "response" of "Ozymandias" when she says, as the tide of washing the job goes, and as the river followers of the expression, even so the art lives on because of our experience in it. Likewise a person thinks of Tibetan painting sand so carefully compose and measure out, and then as they are so beautifully and preciously finished, given the wind, so we might know that all se flux. But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But in the modern world these works of art keep in picture and video. Goldsworthy is a photographer to realize (in need I might say) with all his work, even the people are unsuccessful and tells us to take pictures so that he can look back at them in a more reflective sentiment and see what he was accomplished and it does not have. <br /> This production cinemas directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer and the beautiful and proper haunted music by Fred Frith is not to be missed. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen with one of the most spiritual.
