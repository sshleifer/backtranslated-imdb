When a huge fan of Japanese Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a movie together and made it my mission in life to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film greatly exceeds my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are musicians rather than actors, I've been preparing for the brave yet not really performing performance, but I'm happy to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believe the story as it went in. Moon kids have just the right amount of humor, action, romance and severe, heart-wrenching moments. I can not say that I have ever called more into a movie and the more sensitive moments they are excellingly acting by the fear, in my opinion, definitely prove their skills as actors. The fighting scene is absolutely stunning and although there is a moment of uncertainty to start with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bail with the characters. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
