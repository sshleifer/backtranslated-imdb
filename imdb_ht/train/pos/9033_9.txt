I watched this movie without knowing anything about it as it found it the same thermal Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a father / child fear pair. In both films the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons are facing humming by their peers and both have a strong role model that teach them. <br /> <br /> The biggest difference that I found between these films was that October Sky was an infinitely more exciting and touching movie. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance with Chris Cooper playing dad decapitating very well that she went to perform at the American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston seized me with his subtle direction, very different from its other features directly like Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).
