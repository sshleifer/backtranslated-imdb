I highly recommend this movie. Put in the Bladerunner-Scrolling Future in 2054 Paris, it is in most respects a script movie noir script: lady in danger, sister trying to find her, honest players fight everyone. Luckily, it avoids being stereotyped, and combines a very good and exciting, innovative visual scenario. The movie might remind you Sin City to look, but it has a whole, even more graphic novel look that I've found really compelling. Each frame, each sequence seems like it could have been pulled out of the office of a graphic graphic designer. In terms of history and artwork, you can find nods going back to the quaint ones (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and cinemas like Casablanca, as well as looking towards a mortar future where our destinations are led by corporations. Make any excuses you need to view this movie.
