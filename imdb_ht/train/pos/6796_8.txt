Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film from German born director Ulli Lommel. It directs, produces and co-stars in the latest production. Not only does he manage to make an interesting film about the cheap. But it came to a new bar when Mr Lommel worked in footage from almost all his movie catalogs. I saw film clips in Boogeyman I and II, Birds war, Tired of Wolf, Brain Wave and Coca Cola (even Andy Warhol made a comic from the courtesy of this movie). Even if it uses many old trees, it works well (and many creativity I might add). The movie follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer. It also corresponds to a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about serial killers during the late sixties and early seventies. The Writer's Friend (David Hess) helps him try and find Zodiac wannabe. Can this killer stop? Does the writer put two and two together and claim some of his old glory? Is David Hess Always the Man? You will have to find out for yourself and look at the Zodiac killer. This movie is NOT about the original zodiac killer. I also heard people on this movie being shot on video. So what. The former school artistic director director outshines the fact that he was shooting on video. My only complaint was about the use of stock footage from Mr Lommel's best movie (but I understand why "wink" "wink"). Do not believe the hype. This is a horrible film movie strange and street. As warnings at the start of the state, this film does not praise mortals. You liked the statement. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
