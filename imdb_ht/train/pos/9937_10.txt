This TV series was one of those I loved when I was a kid. Even though I see it now in the pink-bold glasses of nostalgia, I can always say it was a quality, very educational, but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish. I have no idea how good the duplication was, it was too long ago to remember. <br /> <br /> The situation in the show showed you how the body works. I swear, school has not yet taught me half of what I know in this show. It is also tied to other things, as it happens if you eat unhealthy and do not exercise, and beautiful examples of the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature tank types can invade you? : D drawing in beautiful, very child friendly manner of course, but with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and anything else are represented by smiling face figures, looking very nice as you would expect what should look like in the body animated. The series of stories (especially the final final of the environment) was the crucial part of my childhood. I am so happy to find them here.
