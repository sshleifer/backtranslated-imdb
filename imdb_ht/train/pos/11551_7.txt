The ODD Couple (3+ outta 5 stars) Like most people I will still feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "Odd Couples". Their incredible work on the TV series since early in the mid 70's was a major brand of TV at the moment ... easily exceeding the scene and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with a jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau couple? Matthau is especially good Oscar, the slave. Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to Felix, especially if you've already seen Tony Randall's performance. The good script ... definitely Neil Simon's best. (I'm going to go to the file here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most subtly-rated video of the American theater.) The scenario is simple: Felix, a clean freak and newly separated from his wife moved to and Oscar, the Slob who needs some help saving money for payment of alimony payments. Living arrangements become so much a wedding as well, culminating in some fun tiff and spats. Many of the fun with some great one-liner covered.
