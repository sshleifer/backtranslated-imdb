Yes, it's over the head, yes it's a little tricky yes, Constance Marie is a total babe and worthy to see again and again! The jokes and gags can get old and repeat after a while, but the show is always fun to watch. Since it's a family show is the tone humor down and the writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals in between gags. George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously and show off a winner. I am sure he did not intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue. Declaring it and talking in the hilarious glee ... <br /> I must say that one big, black, bitter place is Benny. I hate the character ... so that whenever it's over for over 30 seconds I'm mute the TV just so I have not heard it. There is nothing funny about his dialogue or jokes. As a mom she has to be the worst out and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, like the character, would not stand like someone screaming for long .. <br /> Though ever I get my cut to see Benny I think myself: seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the Bill Engvall Show. Now there is a bad Sitcom ...
