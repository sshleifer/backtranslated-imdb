I can give you four reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the earliest Mexican contemporary cinemas. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related to a great plot. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story of a comedy attitude to the authority to practice the extortion against regular people and still waiting to be appreciated by its efforts. <br /> <br /> Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with an inherited Italian neuroscalist history with a "Peter and the Wolf" - like anecdote. In the third story, one of the seemingly most independent of this series in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the last lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition of this terrible affair in the State of Mexico, this story could not be more updated. <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor of the "Grand Final" in which he puts together the most of the characters from the last sequences of one of the best comedy pieces they have ever filmed. Represents the scene scene from one of his previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti to make a short string. <br /> Once the movie was over, you get a bad feel about watching a good movie (and maybe enjoying it) with a very painful topic. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own shame and this is the best example. This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learned to live in a state of crime (and perhaps accept it), between fire: Criminals and officials are so full of corruption. Even this film is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people were a victim of crime and did not get this hurt. If you had an attack without a scratch then you're lucky. Meanwhile, do not lose the chance to see this film, highly recommended. <br /> And it is a beautiful life in Mexico ...
