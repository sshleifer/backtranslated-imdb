In the element that does so best at this point, I must say # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when poisoned and its reaction is truly magnificent. I imagine that, as a poster suggests, Christine tried to keep laughing during this scene, but it actually made it seem even more delightful to evil, to be smitten at maybe the death of Shemp. Helping this stand out is the Goon. Watching her was a great cross between horrible and funny goof-ball balls. Hardly a character I would choose to encounter in a dark walk or, for that matter anywhere. I'd rather a bit of this whodunit true mystery, but hey, when a short one is right, who will complain.
