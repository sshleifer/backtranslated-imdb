You do not get more dark or tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the game fairly well, with outstanding performance by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expressions show Othello's misery as he falls on the Iago's very compelling, even giving a real epileptic episode. Jacob is the loyal and loyal Wife who becomes the Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of her anger (it is unclear that since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, it is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes though, like Iago, seem more important to the plot. I have not checked the play account movie to see how many lines have been cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even those who seemingly impractical, very well. <br /> If I had any criticism in the movie it would be that the story unfolds too fast, and that the relationship between some of the characters does not expel more. The principal had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and between Emilia and Desdemona need more to develop earlier in the movie. I have a feeling that they are closer to one another than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late film. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although suffering is convincing, the amount of interaction with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand, maybe the only encounter- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> In brief: good performance, too short.
