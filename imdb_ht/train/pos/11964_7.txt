I went to the movie theater in the afternoon to wait to be underwhelmed by Scoop. Fortunately, the movie overlooks expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not anywhere as good as any real number Allen chief - but it's also quite enjoyable as a light comedy comedy. There's something simple and sweet about it. "Cute" was the word I heard from the audience as they walked out after the show. It does not feel like Allen puts out to create a prince here, feels like he wants to do a little comedy and have fun making it. Compared with just about everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. The same thing is fluffy. These days it's just worthwhile to go to a movie made by a real person.
