Samuel Fuller is an interesting movie, especially because he has some very consistent policies in his film. While "Corruption Corruption" and the "Naked Kiss" represent the hypocrisies and lunacy in America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "The Marauders Merrill" painted war as needed hell and "Pickup on South Street" is about the dangers of communist spies. All its films make it look very fun, and even though it was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as any of the major studio designers. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the movie making style is remarkably ahead of its time. It is also a very fast-pace, tight, and sometimes brutal movie noir. <br /> <br /> The action across the board is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes for a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her Communist spy companion. Stealer's show is Thlema Ritter however, in an absolutely fun performance as a police stoolie. Angle fuller staff are great, making the sequences acting more interesting and brutal (this is very violent for its time). The camera continued to move just like Tarantino and his school would be forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action-rhythm noir thriller. "Corridor Shock" remains my favorite movie Fuller, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
