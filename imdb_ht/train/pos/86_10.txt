I remember seeing it in a movie theater (where I went to "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a young boy and never forgot it. She simply surprised me with my friends. I wish there were some ways I could see it again! I tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that with no avail. I only recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film and that blown my mind even more. How heck accomplished this is beyond my understanding. The fish is actually at the CAT at one point, if I remember correctly! If someone could help me find a way to see it again I would be very grateful!
