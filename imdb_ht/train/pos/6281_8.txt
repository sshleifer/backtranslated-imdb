I had the chance to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVDs. This movie remains in its wonderful action and great history. Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it. No movie on DVD has helped make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent act that does not always go along. In general this is what makes this an excellent fun movie to watch. Now, on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you either find two things. A picture that is almost clear crystal with no deformation or a movie with hd hd pictures. I was disappointed when I did that first movie blu ray. I almost started to think that this was a standard blu ray. Although after watching other movies I know better. I do not think they spent so much time they should transfer this movie to hd. This is generally the problem with some movies. And for the price of players Blu Ray and Blu Ray discs you should only have the best picture. So I only consider this a worthwhile investment for those who have never seen the movie or bought the DVD version.
