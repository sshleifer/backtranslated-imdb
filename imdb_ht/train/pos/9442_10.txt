Deliverance is a stunning comedy, every bit as interesting as any good thriller should love to be but also in chest-churningly awesome. Even though it's not a horror movie, it's just as terrifying as any classic horrible movie. The very thought of being a normal red-blooded habit is to enjoy a mild future in any form of civilization, only to be captured and sodomized by a couple of violent hillbillies, is the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population lan. It would be easy for the Passover to slip into exploitation territories, but John Boorman was cleverly avoided the temptation to descend down such a road and made a movie that explores, challenges and challenges the great significance of virility. With many films, you come away from the heavenly wish that you could step into the hero's shoes, perform heroic deeds and save the day and receive the girl .... but with salvation, you become far from praying that you do not Never will experience what these four protagonists go through. Four Guys - Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) - head out into the desert over a few days running down a huge river-to-be-dammed river. The guys are riding the rapids in fear, and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others to pull to the river and wait their pale in the adjacent woodland. Here, the bad falls of two local woodlanders (Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward), tied Ed on a tree, while one of their bandits and rabbis Bobby instructed him, perversely, to "squeal like a pig." Lewis and Drew came in with Lewis, being a fair archer, killing the comrade while other hillbilly beat a sharp retreat in the jungle. Under great emotional stress, the four cans decided to hide the event and get out of the area. But finding the river is increasingly dangerous to negotiate while browsing travels, and the life risk increases when hillbilly survives the vaccine and rifles from some countless vantage points in the side rock cliffs the river.

Although all performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of Beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would have to turn down. The movie is very similar to the film film in 1971, the movie - both movies deal with horrible sexual violence in isolated locations, and in both eventually the violent revenge victims of victims do not cause any sense of satisfaction. The group in the Resistant Province of Deliverance is beautiful look, but it also adds to the tension by placing four kayaks in an environment where they have to have mercy in the hillbillies and landscape, and nobody rely on themselves than themselves . This is truly the film-casting of its finest.
