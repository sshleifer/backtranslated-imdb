I can not believe that others have taken such a serious view of all this. God, it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a huge tribute to the Westerners in the years ago. It was not meant to be a great movie experience, except it was. So what if there was a big bonanza special effect. It was a pleasure, tongue in a cheek, looking at the old west. Man, relax and enjoy.
