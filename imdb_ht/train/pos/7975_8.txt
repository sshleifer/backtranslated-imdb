I just love Malle's documentary. They are so easy and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But Malle managed to make it fascinating and interesting. Love it for humanity, even racist or homophobic, so overwhelming that you just can not help but also fall in love with them too. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of her in 1979. It turned 6 years later to see what had changed. This would be a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this little made it great. It may sound like Malle has just done that in the series Up but in fact it's not. The Up Up Series are about people. Malle's opening is not so much about what happened to everybody, but what happened in this community. And the change is great. 1985 is Reagan's era and farmers suffering. Once a proud community, now no one sees the future at all and parents expect the kids to educate themselves and do something else than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite important today. Our financial crisis today started because of what happened then. Just take a look at the final words of the movie, which speaks of an older lawyer in the city (in 1985): "I'm quite hopeful for this country because things that are going to be right now can be only characterize in my head as an obsession with greed ... And a nation does not live long with that mania. And particularly a democracy ... There's good - there's good - a lot of good in this country and the lot good people and will not - they will not subscribe to the philosophy of greed that is going on now. It's awful. "Unfortunately it took over 20 years with a hell of a headache before what happened.
