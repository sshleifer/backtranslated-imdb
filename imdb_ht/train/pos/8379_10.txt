I remember this film from when I was 12, it was amazing ... i remember it's the day not as much stuff i look back then i was even trying to buy it but like horse chic sh * t! Anyway, the act is a bit darling, but the story is amazing to consider it was a real movie B and a low budget and scene events fighting were amazing to look, I must have looked at it about 20 times. It was a very well-made film and I liked the idea of ​​fighting giant robot man controlled, gracious being looted by making a turn turn into "crash and burn", not watching this movie in its way to pants ! If you are a real movie sci-fi fan then watch this, if it was re-made today it would be a winner .. I really would like to see a remake or even drop the DVD into it.
