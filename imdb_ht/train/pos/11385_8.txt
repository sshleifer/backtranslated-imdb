This is your typical joyful and colorful MGM music from the '50's early and it's definitely over of the ones that are best to watch out. the lead lead. Both have done quite a few movies together back in those days, in which this one is probably best known to one. The film itself actually managed to win the Oscar earlier picture of the year, which meant it beat out movies like "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Wanted Desire", "The African Queen", " Quo Vadis ", the" Blue Veil "," The Salesman's Death "this year. A real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this fun, bright and fun movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all, which is also thanks to the movie to look its beautiful color and many beautiful characters in this movie. The music numbers are also all nicely done, which is not great surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> But really, could not have been all that got told in this movie did in halve an hour or so? I mean, we already know where the film is heading but it manages to stretch it out for as long as possible. Not that it does drag the movie any part, it just does it a bit upstairs. The movie has also been definitely made with a few numbers less music in it. One of the best MGM musicians, that's not its flaws though. <br /> 8/10
