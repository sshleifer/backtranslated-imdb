This documentary was revealed on both RTE and BBC in recent months. When you saw it twice now, I would recommend it to anyone with a media interest and documentary film making. Initially this document meant the details of Venezuelan political life Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew is set in with the intentions. What happens when it comes to Venezuela is thrilling as witnessed first but the attempt is reversed by rebellious factions (particularly oil worries in Venezuela) in Chavez and its government. What we witness to the audience is just how the media manipulated the situation with the backward reverse effect of Chavez by distorting events that transpired as the height of the coup. It's really an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers. <br /> <br />
