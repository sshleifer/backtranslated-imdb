"Writing on the wind" is a melody of the Douglas Circus. Douglas Circus was rediscovered by the "Cahiers Film Theater", Fassbinder etc. .. who considered it as a master director - I think it is because of the complex of his movies - "Writing on the Wind" offers colorful pictures of yummy and gorgeous decor. But I ask myself: Is it enough to bring a movie? Acting "Writing on the Wind" chains of weakness in just (except Robert Stack - he is convinced as the playboy is weak & spoiled). Lauren Bacall, virtually a powerful presence on the screen, is bad in this movie. Dorothy Malone as the seducer, the care-free "femme fatale" is OK, but she misses the strength for the role. Rock Hudson is effective, but steam. The draw contains very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's frustrated with Lauren Bacall - a women in principle, formerly a secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought up with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, pistol, laughter, death etc. - well when I read the story summarized on the back cover of the DVD I thought I was in for a treaty. My fault! Why? I will try to explain: "Writing on the wind" takes seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before the act, in general, is not good enough - the intensity is missing. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just make an effective job. I think perhaps with Italian actors or Spanish scenes would explore completely - they would end up (to us) in an explosion in laughter or tears. What remains to us is the beautiful cinema of Douglas Circus. For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melody, see "Aventurera".
