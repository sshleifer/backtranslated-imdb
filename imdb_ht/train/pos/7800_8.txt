The first time I saw this film when I was about 13. She made me go then and with great respect she still does right now. But I'm less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece right now. There is little effort designed to examine and communicate with racism - and thus fail to recognize that the anti-racist anti-racist gun is understood by its many core of those who committed it. What we find rather is a dichotomy - on the one side, Beco and Woods in 3D panoramic rainbow visions - in the other, two character characters are described as unapologetic misfortune. <br /> This all makes for a big movie story, but it worries me that people see the painting as 'accurate'.
