Why can not more director these days create horror movies like the "shining"? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick has proved once-and-for-all with this film that he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> So the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, lonely hotel to look at it for the off-season. The Kicker is that the host of the hotel violence assassinated his wife and two girls. What follows can be more easily summoned by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me like "scary". It's some things seriously messed up, but in a great way. One of the things that add to the scary factor is the amazing music. Music was a big part of Kubrick's movie (2001: A Space Oddysey and an Orange Clockwork, just to name a couple) and it definitely does not disappoint with this one. The note completely sets the tone and this movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convinced as a crazy killer. In fact, just staring to steal a few scenes from this movie. This is top-notch act that must be seen to believe. There is never a horror movie that matches this one. R.I.P. Stanley.
