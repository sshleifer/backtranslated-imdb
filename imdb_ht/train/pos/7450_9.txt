This is the best quality of Shelley Duvall's high-quality "Faerie Theater Theater" series. The ugly ugly exercises are comedy quality relief, and Eve Arden is the personification of cruel stepmotherhood. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straightforward Cinderella, especially at the scene scene of the Prince Charming Prince Bruteick. Jean Stapleton plays curses in fine, although I'm not sure I liked the "southern" features and some of the lines. Steve Martin's comedy comedy as the Conductor Royal Orchestra is Martin's excellence but a little bit moved to the show's show. <br /> <br /> As is ordinary and the series, there are several comments wry thrown in for the older children (aged 15 and up). With a couple of small rides, the show flows well, and they live happily ever after. Children under age 8 will continue to look after parents finally get tired of it - I get 3 times in one day to be a little too much.
