Closing up your daughter is one of the best comedies that has so much jealous I've ever seen. <br /> It is misunderstood since it lacks the social value of many film films of the day (1969) required to success. The characters are the top-satires of everyday people and played with this goal by all the actors Christopher Plummer shines especially brightly as Lord Foppington, a noble and too big hair to fit into the door. The draw involves the usual 18th-century things; the identities of errors, romance calls, official government officials rotten, and jokes at every turn. <br /> It answers the questions: What happens when 4 rambunctious, craving the sailors on leave in a British coastline? And, who makes them involved with and how it all turns out? Despite the sore at the box office, it has great costumes, excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater music in the same name), large, active living and lying which is obviously authentic. This has never been released on either VHS or DVD is really a shame, since many bad movies are released every day.
