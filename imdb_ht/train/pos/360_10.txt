11 nominations Oscar and Zero win !!! I do not yet understand why - it's not like the actors in the movie made any better afterwards that you can do it by giving them prizes for trivial roles as it did with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery , Danny Glover etc. - was all amazing - I'm curious to get scripts in the discussions of the Oscars this year ... it should go to the Shoulda-would-like category for the judges .... <br / > <br / It is an amazing book - but true to Alice Walker's style of writing it has a way of looking like it is exaggerating its character - so I am glad that the screen adaptation took a few things out. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amazing - African scenes to live a lot to be desired - the African part of the book should be put in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think in Africa in the Safaris - so yes has to be a flattering grassland and wildlife when we all know no West - West Africa - and most in all why get the people to speak Swahili --- that in West Africa speak Swahili ?? I've just found that out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, movie-making - out of this world - classic yes !! <br /> <I own it and look at it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
