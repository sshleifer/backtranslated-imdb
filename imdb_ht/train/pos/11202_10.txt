At first, I thought the ring would be a movie more than usual and its ordinary plot. How wonder I was! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two people - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver plaque, with laughter and fear, and compassion and anguish. The way he painted the popular people in the fair, the force of the girl's attraction to both men, the tragic elements that come along with techniques that opened the most of his greatest movies (North by the Northwest, code, etc.). The master made him great even before his thirty.
