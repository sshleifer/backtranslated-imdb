Undoubtedly beat the street is the best movie on the crush scene. Everything about it is spot on, the clothes (puma), the music and the most important dance! The scenario is basic, but hey what has to say a story about? The whole point in the movie is to show what kids at the moment of their time, what counts. It shows that adolescents are good, all that count in these kids every day was music, dance and friendship. Having watched the DVD lately I was plesantly surprised how well she stood the test of time! The clothes did not look dated (perhaps because Puma is now having a massive comeback), the music always sounds cool, and the dance is always fascinating to watch. A movie anyone 10-25 years old should see as part of their youth culture.
