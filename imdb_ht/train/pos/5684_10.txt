Wonderland is the film's fascinating film of x-rated films by John C. Holmes's involvement in brutal gems. The movie promotion misleads one of the thoughts of a romantic painter in the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights and that is not the case here. In fact, except for a few references made by newscasters that John Holmes is a porn star and a short mount of real life in John Holmes film is intimately drama about involvement of a fallen celebrity and murder and how it happened. Despite being deceived the movie is actually engaging. The action out of the cast is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to go down all the styling of John Holmes.I was completely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes probably looked and act like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or love stories about Hollywood then I think you'll enjoy watching gems.
