Sidney Franklin of the "Good Earth" has achieved statue status thanks to a timeless and superb act, especially in Luis Ranier, who had an Oscar for painting in O Lan. Rainers performance is so comprehensive, it is almost unmatchable. Having a lot of dialogue in the entire movie (and it's a single length), Rainer depends on facial and body language. It looks like Chinese acting to the point that anyone familiar with his work could easily mistake him as such. The movie remains important today because it explores the old clothes in rich history and universal terms that come with it. When Lung and Wife's wife finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of good, but lacking in meaning. Only when they return to the ground after fighting in a swarm of cricket (the special effects used to create are always incredible and beautiful to look) that they again get gains. A common formula was said with unique perspectives of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) to make the movie a classic. Money is not worthless without friends and family, a point that the movie drives home perfectly into it's last 10 minutes and an emotional conclusion concludes.
