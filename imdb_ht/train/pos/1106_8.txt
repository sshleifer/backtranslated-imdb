If you are a fan of Altman great pro ensembles, as evidenced by major films such as M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and younger have seen such a movie as a wedding, then you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH. Centrally located in a Health Convention where two women are running for the presidency, HealtH has a lot of realtors of the Altman's 70s such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett, and Henry Gibson, while also including new Altman stars like Lauren Bacall, James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. Like a lot of Altman films, there are many subplots in this film, but it's not as overwhelming as films such as Nashville or A Wedding, rather than having a more centered feel, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire on the Health Movement, filled with self-scrutiny, weird, contradictory characters, and guest stars like Dick Cavett giving a Wry Next to the whole thing. Underlining the whole election process is Altman's charismatic politics and public appeal but most appealing to this film is the absolute fun that most people seem to have. This would be one of Altman's latest films like this for a while!
