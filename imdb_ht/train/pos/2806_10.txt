Well, the first I hate commenting on this stuff but I felt I had gotten up for this movie. So many people have spotted it and I felt like people would want to see it should take a second opinion. <br /> <br /> The first, bend it like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of centuries. If so, you are looking for another place. Just because it is an independent movie does not mean it has to be artsy. It should make you feel good, and you should have fun watching it and the things that are easily accomplished. Second, the act though not "Halle Berry in the Monster Ball" is always good. The film does not have to act like that so honestly does not look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you want you would not or should not even seek in this movie honestly. <br /> <br /> Lastly, she had a really nice story. I think he thought out well and it's fun to watch. It's also very true in life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you are looking for something that has thoroughly thought out drawn lines and dramatic scenes this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
