This was the black corporation that was like the epidemics crack, gangsta rap, and AIDS that handle the ghettos in the eighties. Dependent, hardworking families have struggled to find out with all the traumas and tribulations they have faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Always full of hope and high jumps on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were difficult but still worth fighting for. Keep yourself upside down, make a wave when you can, show this show how black society struggles to work together as people and their families, before they started cattle on each other and everyone else in order to survive horror at the ghettos. It is heart-breaking to see what black ghettos were like then and what they got now.
