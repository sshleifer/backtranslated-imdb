Joel Schumacher Made a heck of a choice when it was decided on this cast with this script. The story is well written and well laid out, and this totally new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. It seemed that there were 6 "drives" and about a dozen dozens of support, and by far this is the best thing about the movie, facing fresh youth the next day. It has been a long time since Hollywood has touched the controversial Vietnam War film, saying something for the "story that needs to be said" (as indicated by schumacher) and Tigerland ground in that handful of war periods cinema. But he can not mark as a movie war because he seems to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and others. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie and out all the special FX, but just good, bravest drama should go see Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best work in the past 8 years.
