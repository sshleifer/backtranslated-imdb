Jeopardy has felt for being a stock movie of kind - one of the movies that the studio pumped out of big budget budgets / box office. It is only 70 minutes and it does not feature much to lie, and the star is only Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into a convicted escape while seeking help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. The majority of the film is focused on how he deals with his captors, who wants him to submit him in exchange for his help. Some psychologists are fighting. <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little short - short film it makes it tough, and that Stanwyck is great should go without saying (but I will always praise him every time).
