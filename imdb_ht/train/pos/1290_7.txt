Yeah, I remember this one! Many years since I actually watch it. The story was entirely surreal, but great! Whichever percentage and revised movies should bring in mind is that of the respective movie. It's the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Certain films - like this one here - just aim at plain and humorous nonsense. These films can not be rated from the point of view of an hyperskritist. Of course these cinemas lack quality, lacking a sophisticated storyline, often lacking first-class acting, but if they make their primitive satisfaction - this is okay. I do not have this movie here on my list of ever-favorites, but I always thought it was funny, there were some very enjoyable sequences and did a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
