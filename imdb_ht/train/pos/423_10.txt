I just read summary of the plot and it is one of the worst I've ever read. He does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the list of "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a toddler. My sister and I could not wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies in his time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The Romans are clean and endearing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies anymore. Good act and not on the head. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, with many other great character actors.
