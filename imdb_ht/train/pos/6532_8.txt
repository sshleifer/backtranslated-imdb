I think that part of the reason this film was made ... and it is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the games Nancy Drew PC. There have been a lot of movies recently based on video games, and I think this in one of them. <br /> So this movie does not follow any books. But it follows part of the toys. I buy and play each Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. And the games from HerInteractive and for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games actually won the Gold Choice Awards Awards. They are not just fun but you can actually learn something or two while playing. <br /> I took two of my stepchildren with me to go see it and love it! 10 years. Old started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she had so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was allowed ... he not only liked this movie, but could not wait to get home to finish his first game and start another .. <br /> <br / > My other steppe daughter is only 7 and she also liked the movie but it still a little girl also plays the games again, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> The games are based for children 10 years and older. All games are usually found beautiful descent review and are classified as adventure games. For more information about the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was very good and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
