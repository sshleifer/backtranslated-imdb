Featuring Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a beautiful movie, but in my opinion it could be best. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes from the film seem out of place and the romance between them and Van Heflin develops all too fast. I mean, a minute she is ready to beat her, but the next minute she falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the movie editing, and the script (even though the photography was great, the scenery was beautiful and the costumes were beautiful as well) could be a little better. It feels as if the output was too rushed. <br /> <br /> Throw in support was good as well, especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter of Rosie daughter. It's the age of 11, looks really nice and it's a shame that she did not develop into a funny young actress. It is best in this film than in his previous movie as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers in 1938, it's really good at that), when they tried to do it in a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. In general, this movie could be best, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
