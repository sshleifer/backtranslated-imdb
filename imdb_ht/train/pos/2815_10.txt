Can not believe my eyes when it's quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. As if it was a mediocre film in some run-of-the-mill duds. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top though with minimal gore, and all the energetic way of the core. Loved every bit of it. Can not remember anything crazy as this was done for laughing with the martial arts shown. And now the most important thing (at least for me): it's the free computer effect. When I watch some Hollywood actors duking it out on the screen of modern high-resolution and damn big-budget action "fuflo" (a Russian word that means "bull * bip *"), I understand that any * * child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects, and stuff to the action movie. Here it is different. I do not think there will be even a dozen of advanced physical activity stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the movie or playing "Chinese Football". And it's just a little Hong Kong movie made for fun, do not pretend to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD and English band is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere with me. <br /> <br /> Can not help mention a very fine theater game. Some of us, suppose, will not like it. As I - it's amazing. Have a look at Dragon's friends who are talking in a brave way to criminals and all suddenly become a point punch in his left side of the head. Her face expression changes into something capricious and it comes up with dragons and a baby expression. And take a look at the ominous size of her mouth - it's almost in one ear in the other time when it's screaming. <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for the releases of classic Jackie Chan movies. Her modern fashion is weaker in my humble opinion and does not deserve a lot of hype. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary film in its genre. Thank you for your attention.
