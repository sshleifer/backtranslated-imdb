One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra story of this movie added. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I was not laughing and enjoyed a lot of film in a very long time. Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you how Disney was used to be when you were a young.
