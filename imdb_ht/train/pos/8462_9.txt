I just recently bought a collection of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, I'm still amazed by the sweet styling of the animation and slow down, the actions are again reflected in the storytelling. I'm still a fan of ..... and some minor pain. Even though this slang of the Gundam legend is very cool and has what the previous series - a stylish satirical way of telling about the wounds of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything ( sound familiar?), I said that this one gets a bit too gentle-dramatic to continue to explain the lives of the main characters and the perceived abdominal stomach pain on everything that happens and what they need to do to stop The OZ group comes from succeeding in the plans (especially the character called Wufei ... I mean he whines more than an American character on a soap opera. advised, will ya?) <br /> In addition to the over-drama drama, Exaggerated (I think mostly from the dubbing of the English voice actors), this series is still very interesting and will always captivate me once more. I mean he can always get worse. It might be like the recent installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talking about double-dramatic .... I'll chat on one later.
