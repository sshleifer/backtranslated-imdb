Good movie. Tell a juvenile fantasy story, tell us how to pinch us into social situations and what kind of extreme measure one has taken to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you have to break all rules if you are breaking one. If you wanted to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating a social pressing situation? Also it's about the fascism of deciding on other cultural life, of what kind of culture is blocking our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or Suicide Bomber the right to decide what our choice. Is one not allowed to drink coffee in the morning by one self. Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, refer to the charts of the charts and street advertisements before we even had our morning coffee?
