"Sandra, Make a Woman" is an Exceptional Expression Film, and so for two reasons: (1) an excellent but easy performance by Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of projects a. These two talents, both of them well-behaved, make "Sandra" a movie that should be seen. Another key element in film success is its realism - nothing fake or "Hollywood" on this set-in-California movie. It's really a slice of life. The modest home of which Sandra lives at the start of the movie, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at his front door, and Sandra sitting on the couch without make-up , while Digart tries to sell some of its cosmetics, looking really like if it's just up (but nevertheless beautiful), the weird Sandra dangers that love to love with it while wearing a bra, the one-bedroom apartment in which Sandra moves - all of the elements in the movie seem totally real, and as such, the viewer draws to Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately gets interested in it and wants it to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free and eloquent love and dignity and comes with a lot of classes. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily fail from less competent, and could go to any of the usual sexual direction, but the Garver / Gale team sees in it that "Sandra" is not just done a woman but makes an excellent movie.
