Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this fascinating and totally original fantasy of "Lumage" (a combination of animation in stock action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything done by Ralph Bakshi in the great day of his glory. Brilliantly characteristic concept such as Ralph-shaped dog-shifting (one of a duo of bumbling, rejecting heroes), Synonamess Botch (bad-mouth-bad guy) and Rod Rescueman (the initiator firefighter superhero) breathes life into an uniquely intelligent concept : Frivoli vs. Murkwood or, the eternal battle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack should not work but somehow they do. It's a real pity, therefore, that I had to watch this through a really spit-looking boot (abolished from a TV screening) in the uncensored version ?? There is also a mild variant that tones down the language to release its VHS ?? since the movie is otherwise available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture of subordinate abilities.
