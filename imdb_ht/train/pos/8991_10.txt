DIG! is funny, fun, fun, interesting, stylish, and very well done. Knowing that he did on these budget shoestring over his 7 years is amazing that such a story can be said, especially with such style and substance. If you are a music fan or documentary fanatic is a must see. <br /> <br /> Focus on the Brian Jonestown MassSacre and the Dandy Warhols over the years are a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent meeting with moderate success in perseverance and the ability to compromise with a lead singer genius megalomaniacal backed up by a varied cast of characters that sabotage their own success in drugs, alcohol, and frenzy. If I did not know that this is real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative piece of scripted. The story is compelling, short, and simply amazing.
