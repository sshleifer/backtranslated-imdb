This film is definitely an odd love story. Even though this movie can not be much to call on, Nicole Kidman brings the movie on its own the rest of the cast easily can forget, though Ben Chaplin does well a great job in Hertfordshire life and vaccine at St Albans & Hemel Hempstead city center describes the true sense of the area. What starts to bloom like a regular episode of British TV series "Heartbeat" will soon become a flickering gangster action crew. Any really memorable event in this movie is quite small and thus end-up as entertainment without the end of the end decent week. A good thing to watch, and if you like the hero John is only thirty something you can find something to identify with in his character.
