I'll start when I say I'm very happy with this bigger in the Bourne trilogy. Please, please do not ruin it by year-end or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..Moving on.A talent and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it looks as if he just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Corner movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to that job and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how all the information found in the 'Identity' and 'supremacy' of the mails in 'Ultimatum' finally painted the full picture of the troubled past Jason Bourne. The action sequences are fast paced and keep you on the edge of your seat. The battle between the bushes and the killer is always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of cinemas that surrounds CIA agents and how the CIA collects Intel and this movie is right up the street, making it even more interesting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch the Iltimatum Bourne without looking at the previous installments 2. you will always enjoy the movie but I would always recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to completely understand Jason Bourne's character and become attached and to be part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might be, just maybe, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.
