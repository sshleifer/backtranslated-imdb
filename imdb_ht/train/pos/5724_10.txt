Massive multiple frills down the spine! I'm surprised there's someone who did not like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and always feared stiff! And I saw hundreds of thrill / horror movies! To cry, I 22 !!! I mean, OK, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-me. But the genuine look of fear, the sound effects, the sink! From the very start, hit you again and again with relentless, unreliable, terrorist scenes! So much shadow again There is nothing surprise / scary! You know he's coming, he comes, he comes, BOO! and you always jump on the chair. Grab a pillow with a blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch it at night! Hats off of the Japanese!
