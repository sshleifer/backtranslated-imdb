I loved this movie because it basically did more and less. He could have done more fun if they were kept in jail at the studio even more (though some of the tracks elements would have been harder to develop). The DJ playing guy did a great job in showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memory. I also found her dialogue with the callers very funny. While part of the film you can see comes a mile away, the other part you do not expect to turn out the way they did. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a beautiful ghost story for the most part, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were very well done as everything was revealed. <br /> While it was a shorter movie, she felt to be just about the right amount of time telling the story. Any further and it would have started to drag.
