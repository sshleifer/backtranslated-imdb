I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best suits ever as if it is not the best from the three lion kings movie! In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and having tight issues in with others like Timon have problems searching tunnels and other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa travel to find their dream place and find it and soon find it and it's simply the ones they are raising, but soon they have to choose between their dream place or help Simba to face her uncle Scar and proclaim her right as King The Lion of Rocky Pride! Filled with new wonderful characters such as Maon Timon (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because she was very fun and was voiced by a funney comedy Jerry Stiller, father Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to throw Stiller into that role! Full and beautiful characters, animations, and stories with music Lion King 1 1/2 are in my opinion best of any end and better than the Pride Simba though I'll admit I really made as one too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney end of the whole family can enjoy! She got a good story and she's funney so much! 10 out of 10!
