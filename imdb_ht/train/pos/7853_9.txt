For animation enthusiasts it is a must, but even general audience will enjoy CAMERAMAN's revenge, a very early example of 'pixilation' by the hard-working hunter Wladyslaw Starewicz. Starewicz and his assistants have manipulated a flexible rescue feature to tell this story, pave the way for Willis O'Brien, George Pal, Ray Harryhausen, and host of modern digital creativity effects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! , a prison cell. There are two dance dance in the nightclub (made by a frog and a dragonfly), a scuffle between a beard and a grasshopper, and a large-scale donnybrook in the movie, which ends with the fluttering projector in flames. Just elaborate-for 1912, when even John Bray and Winsor MacCay were just beginning, and Walt Disney was still in school class! It is interesting to note, too, what an impact the refinement of a silent film title can have on the story being told. I've seen two versions of this movie offered by two video companies, and look back-to-back, and although the content content itself is almost identical, two different sets of interludes tell two very different stories. (And the scheme to someone to say above is a third story, which suggests that there's another version out there somewhere.) The British Film Institute's printing, which has rhyming interstellar, tells the story of sibling cold, each secretly married, hiding this information from another in order to inherit their late fortune fortune. Other, Russian print, tells a simpler story of honest marriage that each guilty of infidelity. In the Russian version Mr. Beetle visits his girlfriend in the nightclub "Gay Dragonfly", while in the English version French Bill Beetle visit his wife in the music-room. Personally, I prefer the right - and spicier - Russian history; The BFI version tries to draw too much plot into what should be a simple story, and some of the rhymes are somewhat awkward. Still, in any pronoun, the CAMERAMAN REVENUE is a delightful movie, and would make an ideal lead in which other great animated work features beetles, YELLOW SUBMARINE.
