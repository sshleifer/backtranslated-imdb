It's nothing brilliant, groundbreaking or innovative, but 'Dog Day' is for some reason a very fascinating character study. It's like treating CRASH on a bad heroin dose, but not really. It is an Australian film following the lives of many people depressed, disturbing and annoying with abusive relations with each other. It's disturbing, yet very well-done and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the weak-hearted, this very pessimistic film offers no conclusions or revelations in the end, we just see the lives of these people sordid over the course of two days. Grade: B
