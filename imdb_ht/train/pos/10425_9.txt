Major CARUSO was hit in the world's largest in 1951 and broke all record box office at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most "movergoers" stayed-in-homes watching the new 7 "Motorola TVs. is fake --- because they do not adjust inflation ... Obviously today $ 10 movies are dominating. In 1951 it costs 90c to $ 1.60 in Radio City, 44c to 75c first run at the Loew Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in the neighborhood's run What counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unjustjusted box office "Media Turn." The engineering of the great CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the current life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and dropping it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the movie's focus was on the music .. So MGM gave us the best live opera singer MARIO LANZA perform the music of the best-ever-ever singer opera ENRICO CARUSO has been too bad LANZA would throw his career life into oversupply. Edmund Purdom took his seat - with the voice of the Arcy Lanza, and the ancient Lanza beautiful and low-fat in the picture. If you want to see the big CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Not to be put in the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
