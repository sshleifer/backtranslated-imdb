Ho, Ho, Maniac homicide! This dynamic trip-de-force adaptation of a great EC funny story story is undoubtedly one of the best episodes in the set of cable sets ever made. The director of Robert ("Back in the Future") Zemeckis is made out of a witty script by Fred ("Night of the Ramps," "The Squad Monster") Dekker which centers on a ruthless housewife (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when he starred in this episode) kills her jerk in a husband (a wonderful queen by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve by whacking her head with a fire-poker. Complications are being made when a fool crazy dress up as nicer Kris Kringle night out of a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor an unusual desire to visit. Alan Silvestri's spooky, vibrant notes and typically polarized Dean Cundey's movies further enhance the grim fun. And Larry Drake (Benny's cute sweet giant on "LA Law"!), And his guffs climb the steppes, a demented twinkle of his glowing green eyes, and a truly lean, leering, grin for a sensational bloody Saint Nick .
