I really enjoyed the first episode and I'm looking forward to more. A little soft on the front of crime (it's almost a backthought and not terribly suspense or meat out) but thought the edge of romance was pretty good. Will look again for sure! <br /> I hope they will have a bigger role for the aqueducts that are wonderful actresses and have been a bit underused this time around. The actress who plays the waitress / waitress (also out of shelter I think) is very sweet and dumpling and comes in as nicely dorky and sweet instead of mute and annoying that is very nice. <br /> Check it out.
