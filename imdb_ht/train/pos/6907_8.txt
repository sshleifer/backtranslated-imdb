This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" and Kevin Klein, you'll get a kick out of this. Think "Dave" goes to South American as Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between works, who is chosen by the head of the island nation of the paradise secret police, replacing the past drug to a dictator Alfonso Simms, after he He had a heart attack and died. Noah bumps together, helping in the role of the former dictator's mistress, as they try to block their plans in Raul Julia. Jonathan Winters also makes an appearance as a hearty American emigration that seems to be CIA. ALSO start Polly Holiday with Fernando Rey. There is an absurd moment like the old dictator body holds frozen for a year, with the final scene, where Sonia Braga, who has bee cradling the blood, bullets riddled in Dreyfus is seeing moments later all of primitive white, and nary a smudge about it. But all of it is a great stuffing.
