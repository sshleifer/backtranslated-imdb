It's probably not just that I've had to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get added that people have forgotten, but oh well ....... <br /> <br /> From a standard of act, how could any actor fail with these characters? Each one is mesmerizing and intense in the activities of life. Tony Soprano - while a "Capo" mob and suffering from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him, and knows what to do to survive. Each of its men, you see their lives virtually from the inside as the true form of vainism. It definitely carries out a sort of "island" side of each and every viewer, and I include myself in this! <br /> While some of the above do not care for Bracco, I said this is the coolest role it had in years since good Fellas. It's Tony's side that makes him listen to reason, making him decent, which offers him relating when dealing with his human emotions that he failed to feel for long, if ever. It is simply putting, delivering it. (Do not speak in religious tones) <br /> But the knockout performance here is undoubtedly Edie Falco. To see his guard's role in other HBO acclaimed series, "Oz" and then see it as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. It has exceeded the limits of a recognized actress, something only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with. A sort of chameleon quality transcends their role. But, as I mentioned earlier, with a strong character as such, how can any actor fail? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Livia's power is in its daily affirmation of faith in itself. She is a survivor, as she hopes her husband and family will survive. She was prepared for the worst because she knows her husband's dangers business, but she knows the shape she is more and more women from Jersey. It's wise whether there's no wiser and more compressed street then Tony himself. <br /> In all, the biggest crime in the soprano family is that the viewer has to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series. That was what made the Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, dreaming about, and others back down the world of popularity and eventually killed them. Too many space between season and many times. Until then, I will look at the reruns in the hope that this difference in programming is full.
