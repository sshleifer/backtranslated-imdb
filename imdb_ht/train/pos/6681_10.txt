This movie deserves its best It's great fun, there are some wonderful jokes and gags in sight, some of the things for the "Geeks" amongst us (and we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effective. Watching Paul Reubens Fart in the face of a Academy Award winner is worth the cost of admission alone. I never read the comic series before I saw the movie, but they have since been. As good as they are, I always recommend the movie MM. (Although the Carrot Flaming as a Character would have cool, too) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE might be the Shoveller except William H. Macy's favorite line of film in? "We had a blind date and Destiny, and it seems he ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. Buy this movie! Only 5 bucks and some changes to your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Really you will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. ALWAYS makes it look-worthy
