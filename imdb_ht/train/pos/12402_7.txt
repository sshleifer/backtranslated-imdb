** Warning! Spoilers ahead! ** This short is part of the two explaining the short portion of the "Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the womb came. Because we already know the story, the plot itself has no surprise; and the short is not so fun as informative. But that's how it is presented, as a record of the historical archive. Visuals are better than average, and the colors generally cool to help the goal of the short. <br /> <br /> A couple problems. The violence in the story is a little free and combined with the occasional dose of political regulation (UN scene), detracts from the narrative narrow in the short. Plus it needs to be seen with the two parts to be completed. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix composition is brilliant, and despite a few problems, this short story always meets its goals. It would not have fit in the original movie in style, content, or sink. This is the perfect method to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good information. Could have been said a little better, but still a solid 7 of 10.
