I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year, and it was just overwhelmed by it. It's a rich, warm novel to bring to the screen, very well-acting, and well-directed. More than anything, she reminds me of the films of David Lean, both of her ability to handle a complex story, with her tales to create powerful performers that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in the years.
