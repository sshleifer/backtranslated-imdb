Have you ever seen the original room room, and I judge this movie on a clean slate. And I must say, I enjoy it. Sure, some of the act by Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was 80's. But even if you can not get past it (and I almost could not) or kill It's revenge (which seemed a little bit .. overdone; P), it's worth it just to Harry's room. Or at least at the very least, the bull dog is affectionately named 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
