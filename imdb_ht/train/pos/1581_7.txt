Goebbels motivation to back down was not explored. In consequence of Stalingrad, the Reich decided to go for 'total war'. This is referred to in the movie. This part was used by women in the war effort, which Germany had not already made at any major limits. A woman SS massacre would have faced Goebbels with a disaster public relations in massive proportions. His preferences made the problem go as slowly as possible, on the basis that the Jewish guys could still round up later. I understand that the majority have survived the war. His other problem was that Berlin's 'Red' had never been very enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be cautiously handled. Again a massacre of women could cost the Nazis the level of mediocrity in their support of capital. <br /> It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms showed the patches that the guys brought were not in German nationality, but they came from German origin in other countries like Lithuania or Latvia
