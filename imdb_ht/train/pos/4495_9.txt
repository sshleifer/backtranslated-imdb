Outside the house is a different world and the family struggle breaks the line between Father authorities and their hopes and dreams. The period is captured; The lightweight lightweight, Georgian flooring, the photo rails, the wallpaper, the short skirts, the cheeky boys, the Mini wind, shiny modest manglies. <br /> <br /> The place was captured; A glacial garbage landscape landscape, rocks of local stone, community, freedom. But there are many more; Women, happiness, sensuality, pride, worth, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in deep sense), love, struggle, growth, naivety, morality, faith, faith, trumpet, machis, behavior, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice , horror, acceptence, revelations, comedy and parents are all there. (And in no particular order!). This film is a rich expression of family tensions that are as journals today as ever. The fact that some of these do not directly address God's covenant in the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a test of skill to act, the story and the direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Maybe I misunderstood - the bankruptcy and gloom felt by teenagers really disappear if they deal with it (**) - maybe the movie trying to send the same message too - well worth doing. is the movie trying to say? Kids: Parents are young, parents are also fighting, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, struggles can end up happily. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to welfare. <br /> It sounds simplistic by it? Sometimes the movie feels like it, but it's then that you notice how much they were challenged and discovered. <br /> <br /> The movie is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No problem themsleves.
