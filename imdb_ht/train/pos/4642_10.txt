The review called this movie has a clear bush to the point. Obviously it was not young or innocent in a very long time, or it might have been understood that the tragedy in it was that the significant significant young characters actually thought they could make a difference by setting up posters and holding a disadvantage for peace. If only it was that easy. But the cynics sit and the epidemics of those who seriously try their best to do better things, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Both sides will tell you stories of atrocities committed by the other side, which they think justify committed themselves even more in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently it lacks the meaning of the "bubble" referred to in the name, that people living in Tel Aviv are unusual to cut out from the ugly facts of what goes on all around them, which is partly why they seemed naive. (He also thought that Ashraf could slip into the dams without a problem, telling me he had not paid attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he met.) I found it pretty brave to the director, writer of scenario, and both star star lovers, to update the Romeo & July story in a modern twisted country, and to perform both male lovers. Let's be honest here: Very few people would have a problem if one of them was a girl (young people have the whole heart) - but when people are in anxiety and sexuality added to the fact that, incredibly, these same people prefer to make them hate each other, then the conclusion is inevitable.
