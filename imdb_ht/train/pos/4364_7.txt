I never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. Playing the character's title, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit into the role that he leads to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a really good work as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person who is very likely to make your skin pull. <br /> <br /> All in all this come out as good "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think of how Hollywood released nearly back-to-back movies to take a slip in England. Really good. Also begins John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
