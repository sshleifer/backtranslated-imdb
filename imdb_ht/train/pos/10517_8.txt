Lavish production value and solid performance in this straight line adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic on the wedding game in and between the classes in the 18th-century England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mix as friends who must pass through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a bravery virtue that goes a long way towards explaining the accessibility of the source material material (which has tone down a bit of its difficult doubt). I liked to look at the movie and how the shots were set up, and I thought it did not exceed too much succession of top shots like most other films in the 80s and 90s. Very good results.
