As a knowledgeable fan I recommend this movie as loyal to the realities and acts of kindness. As a 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused the girls to call. I thought hmmmm, if girls love them, they must be crap. Only my files until then were Haley Mills, Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly after vacationing with the family in a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I learned was 'like me doing') and was floored by the difference between it and all the songs I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Beatles Beat' album at my older brother I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book at the beginning (by Davis) I was surprised that this film was followed by doing so well with the exception of leaving most of sex with some of the drug usage (she was touching use of metadrenal / dexadrine). >
