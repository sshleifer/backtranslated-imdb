This exciting Giallo boosts a typical scheme but still thrills with a really sadistic assassin who obviously likes to hunt his victims down before killing them in gory style. Led by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year earlier, also made very interesting in "The Night of Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (also watch my comment on that one), the movie begins to slow down , but all in all, there is no time to waste and unnecessary sub plots or sequences. /> <br /> This movie is a German-Italian coproduction, but was released in Germany on video only in a ready-made version by 15 minutes to draw under the title "Horror House". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are completely intact, and the viewer still gets the killer motif to the end. But the Italian version of the foot is always the one to look for them, of course. <br /> A convincing Giallo and Torsion binding with red herring, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended Giallo fan and a little superior to the Miraglia above mentioned other thrills.
