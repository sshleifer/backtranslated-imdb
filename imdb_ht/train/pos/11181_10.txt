This is one of the most creepy movie cinemas, and most bride ever! (Louise) and her family move to a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and son (Gage) all looks normal until Dr. Creed loses one patient to him who was a terrible head injury, That's why he's haunted by the ghost knowing as Victor takes him to the pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis does not know if all the dreams were talking to Ellie who was worried about her cat that would be killed by lorry and then later on Rachel says Louis is really hard to talk about death because In her sister Zelda who was really sick (as we see in a flashback how her siblings really were and this is one of the most creepiest scenes ever!) The next Louis Louis gets a call from Jed to say there are cats as being killed by lorry and Jed taking it to the place where the Victor Holy said he did not go! And bury the Cat, his wife and children are going to see Grandparents and Louise are home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it's as wrong in her eyes so she goes to see Jed And Jed tells her that He was buried too (as we saw other flashbacks). Later in the movie The Family comes out having picnic, Gage is playing and looking at the Gage says I drop it ", the wind blows the stick near the road where a truck comes in the fast past, Gage will get closer to routes, Louis is rushing to get her, the most heartbreaking scenes in any horror movie will be left with your paw on floor or Shivers going down your back when you hear Louis shouting, Soon she misses so much, Louis then Gage Gage at the same place where the cat buried. <br /> <br /> The horrible thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from real life. This movie is just amazing and Acting in everyone was great! 10 August 10
