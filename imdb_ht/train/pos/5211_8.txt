Since the nasty divorces from Disney Company (with Disney kept Mark Miramax) Weinstein's company seems to specialize in movies above the average and then under-encouraged and noticed by some. FLOCK is a prime example. <br /> A story about civil servants who have nasty jobs in keeping track of sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex gangs than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives her best-ever performance as the soft-speaking agent worn-out by the work. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk normally gets stuck in) and makes the most of the novice play. Cinematography, rhythm, correction, all of it is the first percentage - and I've seen no trace of attention-to-go-camera-jumping cats or around camera cuts others to complain about. The subject is busy with constraints, but it's still a difficult subject and it can make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kind of sexual offense shown in abundance that will be even jaded. Then the Supreme Court ruling that at the same time tied police but as the "rights" of sexual perks were opened up with America turned into a buyer's paradise for sexual perverts, both unwilling and unwilling. Each step was met with praise by liberal, who celebrated the Warren Court's misfortune and sparkling over time with Newsweek. Daily Libraries also praised the action of the Court and passed those who did not agree. In 2007, how many Americans know that pornography depicts wild violence and torture to young women - can subscribe and delivery to subsidized periodic discount rates by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem - a problem that can tear people in the family of slaughter. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but gives her best of her performance here. Perhaps at his mature age he became a measure of wisdom.
