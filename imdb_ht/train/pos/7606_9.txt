The first series of Objects chase with a bang ... literally and slowly reduces the speed. This can put some viewers and people who started looking halfway would either be bored or just plain confused. <br /> I would advise new people in the world to lose simply look at the beginning and not get pt off by the slower episodes. The act of all is excellent but why there are 5 series' planned ... WHY ??? All this means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years, or I will continue to look at whether he tries to lift the tension and dialogue flowing.
