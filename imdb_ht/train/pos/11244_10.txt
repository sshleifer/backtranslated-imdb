One of my best films ever, maybe because I was fine at the punk scene in the late 70s and went on a lot of concerts, but the movie was a good and very good story acting by hazel and a rose, it comes Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders! Excellent performance by many unknown actors that if you keep your eyes shaved will see them in many of the soap UK today ex: Carver from the Bill, the more I watch it more of them I spot, well if you have not seen it again have a night in with the video, do not forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and makeup black eyes eyes and head off yourself Mochanian style .... Enjoy
