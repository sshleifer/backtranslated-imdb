I dug out of my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Academy Awards for Best Photos in 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of mean and she is very interested in helping her, but soon finds her like the guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls for beautiful girls, Leslie Caron. Its main dancing partner, and I must say that they are fantastic along the floor and otherwise. Best French singer Georges Guietary songs, too. So, if you like dancing good and full full fun full of Oscar Levant pianos pianos, the songs of George Gershwyn live forever on this colorful gem. 8/10
