I've read Blaise Modesty for many years now, collecting numbers in the field. After the fiasco film made many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise" I was surprised that the result got this good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie that is not based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How Modesty was created based on the own story and that part of his life was affected by his childhood. I think this will give a much greater understanding of the next (I hope) movie. I simply liked the old-fashioned cinema style. <br /> However everything was not that good, the gambling was not that good. almost boring and real. The act can also be improved. I do not think the bad guy in this film felt real, the only reason he was so Modesty could have someone tell his story for. Also they could expand the movie, showing more about when it builds up the "network" but I'll guess that for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please forgive me for my bad English
