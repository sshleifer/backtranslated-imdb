Clair Denis again reviewed his theme of elected father, men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion, without the emotional number of families but while nénette and boni from the earliest movie live in a narrow world of Marseilles , the test of Louis Trebor of the Intruder takes us from a remote location on the French-Swiss border halfway across the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again the movie begins in the middle, and Louis, in its sixties, for survival with a sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of physical condition. We learn that Louis is not alien to violence as his cabin is the place for smuggling and bullets at a regular event. Louis sleeping with a big knife under her pillows and nearby rifles. Denis is in no hurry to move the action together, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis out of his everyday activities and some people he deals with together the border including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost inconspicuous with long hair and a wisp in a mustache) who rejected him as a "crazy":, portrayed as a dedicated father in two. There are many short scenes that, while still relating, build an impression of Louis and his thousands. Ms Godard's camera work is exhilarating here. The metaphoric control is Louis's heart transplantation for which he goes to Korea and then Tahiti to search for another son, does not find, and where Louis's new heart rejects him as Sidney rejects the old . We are accustomed to the short scenes of Denis's movie which are inexplicable: Never spit eating bonuses with a spoon; a drive by shooting to Bonny's father and then the briefing of images of bonuses and a bullet injury to the head; a scene from Louis in a mog with a coffin and the mark of a transplant but the body of Sidney. Implications, two of the last, are a rejection, real or imagined, not a father, killing something indefinite of a son.
