I was especially pleased that in this film Othello itself was black-skinned and Desdemona did not have hair just like almost always. The cast was played very well, too, and I liked the script after Shakespeare's original text for loyally. But I must say some scenes have acted too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I always thought it was very modest, and that's why it's not good at all to show him in bed with Cassio - although he's only happening to Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little amazed that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona showed so openly. But, as a whole, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the dead scene.
