I was very surprised by this movie flick. Even if the budgets were obviously lacking, you have to be impressed that this film took 7 years to make and always got back good. The act was very impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the finish really was a bit abruptly for my taste. But hey if your audience leaves wanting more then this movie has succeeded. <br /> I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella Rio who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now day with all the bad novel about acting). Antonella RÃ­os is really a star on the rise.
