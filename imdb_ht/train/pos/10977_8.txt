I took this out of the night library of other, with no idea of ​​cult, influence the movie, or that it is now being staged as a music. (!) Most of the comments here are about targets, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad explosive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The Chritterion Scripture has been extended to anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> I think you can also see in little Edie falling into a class of sort of missing, you can hear her in old movie by Jackie O too; people just do not talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would be interesting to find out more about how the house falls into disrepute, Old Edie at least always seems aware of what's going on a certain degree; Could not He See the Once Spectacular House Disintegrated? But the film's subject is the life of the women to build themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act. Well worth your time.
