Kurosawa is a story that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and the act is true to the story, and each star plays their role as part of the bigger story. It is touching, funny and intriguing to every part. The character development is near perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you to. <br /> I would like to say that the "samurai phenomena" and those obsessed with 18th and 19th centuries Dynasty accounts in Japan can skip this movie as Kurosawa's best work. Perhaps not his best, but even in his worst, Kurosawa is better than much of the best. This story is so based on elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite being put in the not-so-distant past. <br /> I would recommend this to any movie manure, and especially to give people the chance to continue on the novel on which the movie is based.
