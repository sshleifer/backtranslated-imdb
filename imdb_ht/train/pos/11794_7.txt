This is well kept, fascinating, tragic storytelling. Well, and for the most accurate part, consider it a TV movie rather than a documentary. They created some fictional characters, and combine several current people into a character, but otherwise this is a good say in a very tragic and black story. The final moments of the movie, depicting suicide / murder suicide, are almost directly taken to an audio recording performed by Jim Jones. This recording took place during the last 44 minutes of the temple's existence. It is available in many places on the Internet. This part of the film is almost spot on in that regard. <br /> <br /> For sum up, a documentary this is not. However, it covers most of the base elements in the People's Temple history.
