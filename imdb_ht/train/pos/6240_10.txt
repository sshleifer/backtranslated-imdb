Dog Day is one of the most accurate films I've ever seen describing life in modern cities. It's very hard and cruel at some point and unfortunately it's very close to reality. Insulation, despair, deep emotional, problematic, pervertion, complex, madness. All that is present in the big cities advanced in today. It makes you realize once again the state that tends to who has lead society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city has never been photos on the screen for good. I just want it a lie. Unfortunately, it's not. That's why ... 10/10.
