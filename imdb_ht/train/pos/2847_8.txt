As it is generally known, film anthology does not make very good tickets with American audiences (I guess they prefer a standard line line). New York, I love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & people who live & love in them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I really enjoyed. The film has made several sections, each writing and / or director of a different director (most of them were French but have a very funny segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like Paris, this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), and also likes' Paris'deals and New Yorkers, and why they love their city live in. It features a toothpaste, featuring the love of Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki, and also features such as seasoned veterans as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, and others do not (although I suppose it will depend on individual flavors --- I will not ruin it for anyone else to reveal what worked for me & who is not t '). Word is that the next entry into the series will be Shanghai, China (is Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece out of the question?). Speaks mostly in English, but there are bits in Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. MPAA's Rated Rated for strong language and sexual content
