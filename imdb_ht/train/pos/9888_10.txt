Although this beautiful work of art uses some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort. It is a political allegory and cultural monument in Mexico's post-colonial Odyssey, as a glimpse into Mexico's history. <br /> In contrast to "Like Water for Chocolate," "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet at least half way so that his understanding takes a little effort. (A good starting point is to see the grandmother character as Spain: proud, aloof, mourning and, above all else, press-down-and-history.) <br /> <br /> The ultimate actions of the heroine They are dark because the "result" of history (ie the present) is still dark, since we are too close to honest evaluation. The cleansing of the same loose tip is the only real choice available to the director, providing the movie ambition. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is gorgeous. A great screen experience would be ideal, if you can catch it in a local art home or university screening. But if not, VHS is better than never seen it at all.
