This would be the 2nd best WWV in the year after Wrestlemania was a good surprise! Jan Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jeriko. Jeff Hardy kept her IC title in a short sloppy match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a violent matching match on Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman who was suprising me. Booker T beat the Big Show in a no dq match, at a Booker T score gave the Big Show kick scissors and sent it right to the table. In a stupid decision by the Christian WWE Christian and Lance, anti-US jealousy defeated Hogan and Edge with a lot of help in testing with Jeriko. RVD and Brock had the match in the middle of the night and was filled with great high spots, and RVD had caught my IC title in a DQ so I was happy to keep the title. Triple H has also signed up with Eric Bischoff and Raw which means little is nothing. And at the main event the Rock became the first ever 7-time WWE World Champion to beat both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple threat match. Overall this is probably the second best WWE PPV in 2002! 7/10
