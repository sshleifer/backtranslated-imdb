I grew up in Brazil and I was visiting and surprised at the beautiful coast where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and it is part of the "Green Coast" in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is some 150 miles from the city of Janeiro. This film brings back to world life in 16th century Brazil, where the Europeans have barely begun to explore the coastline, which has always been in primitive and little populated populations by various native tribes. French and Portuguese fought each other for territory and upper hand on Brazilian trade, all while negotiating with their native, who also fought each other for whatever reason. <br /> A French misfit ("a mercenary") who left dead by his own compatriots, but managed to escape and keep prisoners by an all-naked tribe. While it is a "slave" of the prince, according to the custom of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to kill and eat at a ceremony for revenge. > <br /> What I love about this movie is that it recreates in the love of the native villages and their way-of-life (they were naked and cannibal) and asked us to recognize and accept life At such times as it was: in a gorgeous garden-of-eden, life was dirty, violent, full of pathetic and customary superstition. The Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence and better weapons and greed. There is no romantic "fantastic nobody" or "heroic explorer" here, it is just those who are trying to survive in a difficult world. The film is neither too sensitive nor reminiscent of the natives. From what I know in the subject, the deposition is fairly accurate that adds a time to the uniqueness of the project: how many movies did you see regarding the lives of native Brazilian and early affairs with the Europeans?
