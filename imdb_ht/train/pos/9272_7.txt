This was the first of Panahi's films that I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I have totally absorbed the different characters that it creates and how different they react and behave compared to Aussie kids and again on other similar levels. I think maybe if more people could see movies like this, they could see people as people and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown. There are obvious major political differences between Oz culture and Iran's culture, but I've found the more subtle differences between the characters, that this film is out for successful on screen, very fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies of the characters that look like me, so unique. I found it made the characters compelling look.
