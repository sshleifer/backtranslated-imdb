Maintenance Jim Belushi car, a modern version cockeyed in It's a wonderful life. Michael Caine plays a sort of angel that allows Belush to see what life would be like if he "made it big". Jim is at her best with a good story and casting support; looks like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not a Oscar contender but good hot-hearted fun.
