Number one size - read the title as "time of the angry dog," or perhaps dog. This is a beautiful piece of nice (look at the cast and rent it - you know you are curious already), and first time Bishop director gives them the chance to take his time, leaving the characters communicating with the landscape screens as they stay Waiting - not enthusiasm - to return to the "great boss" and regardless of the revenge indices ... For some of us, the record will see Christopher Jones after exposing self-imposed him out of film; he remains a movie attendant presence. And yes, and Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor participate, this is the "Wild at Streets" reunion party!
