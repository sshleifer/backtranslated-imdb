Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or here) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same can not however be said for the rest of the movie. It's not terrible and I'm sure it's done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I was to be honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest you are the best only to read the Old Testament.
