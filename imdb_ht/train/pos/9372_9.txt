Red Rock West is one of the rare films that keep you guessing the entire time like what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to get jobs. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays the best. Look for a short look by country song star Dwight Yoakam. This is a very serious drama in the time but there are some lighter moments. What is important is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality efforts!
