I saw it many times that I could before leaving the scene. A delightful and fun movie with some of my very favorite stars. Only want I could get it again! Would certainly buy / see if I could. Please, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, with its leading lady, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver was beautiful and charming. It was a music, but also romantic, funny, and smart. This was my favorite movie starring Haver June, although I still love her. Smiling dawn also lit up the screen, and his beauty and talent was an advantage in any movie. Throwing credit support supports individual roles. A well-rounded and light-hearted movie; Only want we were more like it!
