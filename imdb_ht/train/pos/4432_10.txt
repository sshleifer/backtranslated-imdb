I happily admit that I'm a pistons for a beautiful movie, and enough to invent camera motion and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a long film movie. There is no Gojoe longing though, though it has some of the most remarkable movies I've seen since the Korean teaser period. However, Gojoe gives far more than beautiful images (such as MUSA ... does not mean a contrast) - it's second-most powerful force is superb act, with a fascinating story and some very dark philosophies. I must admit that it was well known that the point he was trying to do in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts on the road. The waves, but definitely think: p <br /> A department in which the movie could best be the action. There is a tremendous amount of bankruptcy in the movie, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and often observed by objects in the foreground. It creates some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would be nice to see some more current moves, something to make it more credible than the bandits could just walk around the entire gaming army. Still, the movie is definitely one of the most exciting and most beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
