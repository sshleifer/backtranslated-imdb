This film is basically a documentary of the chronological series ordered at events that took place from April 10, 2002 through April 14, 2002 at the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. Pathos in the movie is real and one feels pain, sadness and joy of those who have lived in this fate of the coup of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> One comes away to watch this film that Hugo Chavez is really a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personalities brought one-handed Venezuelan people to the three-day military installment and re-establishment of the Democratic Venezuelan government. Bush helps with the Venezuelan abuses of the coup. This mainstream media helps and abides George W. Bush is not surprising. What surprising is how some people saw this film and how some people realized the total corruption of America's mass media. <br /> It took only 20 years for Ronald Reagan to eliminate the Fair Doctrine of 1986 to turn Americans into blind and rudderless states. May Hugo Chavez opened the American patriots' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
