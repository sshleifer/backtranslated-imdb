My second move to do this in a movie, it would be great !! I was also amazed at the storyline and characters built in this game. I played it again and again (more than 20 times) just try something different and it becomes more interesting every time. Final Fantasy feeds your heart out! This should be done in a movie !!!!! If someone has some help getting started for a petition, please contact me. I would like to help with this project any day. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget it is PS1 most of the time. The people in side quests make it different every time you play.
