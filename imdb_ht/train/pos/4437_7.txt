This police procedure is worse than many others in its day and better than a few. Obviously it follows in the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but results as an enjoyable programmer. The best thing about it is the unadorned look given in a world now long ago ... the lower New York class at 40 late / 50 early. Here it is in its seductive glory, from the old-school saloon tattoos to the cheap hotels in the fatty spoons. The old police films are like traveling in a vintage era and many sums of money to anyone who is disgusting to sanitize, the city is similar in today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our main hero, Tobin and Corrigan detective, do the footwork, but without effort they are tiring and slow in the "laboratory boys", they would find nowhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops here use the dogged persistence of a C.S.I. investigators to track people. <br /> <br /> How some reviews have been written about this movie, you think it would be headed by Ed Wood and acting by spending out of his movies. Ki bosh! I enjoyed John Miles as the old Marine gangli turned to Tobin's Cop ... he had a happy-go-lucky, easy-going approach going to the role that is a welcome shift from the usual rock-facing Histrionics to most cops film of the period. Patricia Barry is beautiful and delightful as her perky girlfriend helps resolve the crime. Walter Kinsella is clogged and rubbed as the greatest detective Corrigan. I prefer to love these two chemistry and it's done for something a bit different than the robot approach "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> Mystery in itself is not too deep and the chase and shoot-out finals certainly will not rank among the classics of crime movies, but while it's time to run, the "Stranger shopping "more than held my interest.
