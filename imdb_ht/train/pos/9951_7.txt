If you ever wonder why they do not do pornography with a conspiracy, look at Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must provide the Armstrong credit both to strive to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some power beyond it. On the other hand, it also rapidly becomes apparent why most pornography never has more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue connecting sex gaps together. These people simply can not act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to a ridiculous degree). <br /> <br /> Still, I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there does not seem to be a lot of an effort to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more attempts like this one. Perhaps one day I'll see the perfect combination of pornography and draw.
