With stunning cinematography with a sheer string of Kafkaesque, this film made me out of the opening but simple but fascinating scenes. The movie plays a lot like a dream, and I think that's why people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and maybe a bit pointless. But these are weaknesses in the movie but conscious choices. The movie works is not trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of the 1940 cinema war. <br /> I would have problems arguing that there was so much real substance in the movie, but the movie is such an amazing cinematic that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautiful films ever recorded, and there is a wild imagination in its style. I can fully understand why people would hate her, but I give her 9/10.
