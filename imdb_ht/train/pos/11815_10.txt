At the time I write what I see from over 15,000 votes it has a rating of 5.8. Something wrong with this picture. Personally I give it a 10. I can see a 7 at the lowest or 8 possible if it's rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It is a movie based on a comic book hero. This film was more than shared in awards. Won 3 oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... right have told me it's better than a 5.8. Some great acting of some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not a classic for years to come. If you are looking for more entertainment, make sure you check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can watch over a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
