The throw is different and now they have taken a different approach we have the smart street team "Networth" vs. suppose professional team "Magna" but boy if you think the smart street team would have problems you should be fine. While the Magna team struggled at times, the street team was simply disintegrating week after week. <br /> The first few things are repeated as far as the "Apprentice 3" first of it continues the same absinthe mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if you are a good project manager but you lose, The team will turn to you, and you will be fired, despite the fact that your team's outfits are often the ones that perform half ass jobs. Simply absurd, that a game shows that claims to hire the best candidates actually "weeds" come out the best while the dysfunctional candidates sew each other until one leaves and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone who this season, weve seen a total of cursed, backstabbing and even gay offensive stag babies being carried out as teams attempt to campaign. The list of victims until Tara Dowdell's cast, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner three is just that I felt unfairly shot by Trump, the rest really came as they were just encouraging conflicts, anger and suffering. It's just amazing as one candidate Audrey Evans said as he did a good job shooting and how some of his worthless jerseys are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes it's the game, it's the "Apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing, and still popular "all gang up on the project manager" mentality rules. <br /> It has a fun ride, though, the candidates are given a wide array of duties in photo shoots in the construction of golf mini golf, in the new apartment building. <br /> <br /> Always if it's still the "Apprentice" though so all you can do is basically laugh at the whole time as the frenzy and chaos inserts until the lucky person is the winner.
