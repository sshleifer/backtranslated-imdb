[No Spoilers] <br /> Being a movie by David Lynch, one could have the idea that it depicts that the enigmatic idea of ​​it as the majority of film features it does. But it is a very straightforward story as the title might hint. Not to be kept in the usual Lynchian cancellation of incomprehensibility usually following after seeing Highway Highway. It's a simple movie but it's indeed a great movie. This is both in an innovative and fun way. It's innovative because it does not Lynch. But maybe Lynch. He likes to twist our spirits and therefore putting together a movie that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avid director, he might just make a movie like this just to torment its regular audience because he knows what to expect but does not give it. That would be crafty. <br /> <br /> The mash in the movie is slow. I would almost say lawn mower speed ... do not expect an orgy action, but the movie is really fun for those who go and the movie flow. Look carefully for these small details that Lynch draws throughout the film for our entertainment. Look for great movies that make this movie come to life. And listen to Badalamenti's notes with the main theme that really host Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes are often shown. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth put in one of her best performances in this movie, making it one of the most favored people ever to portray on film. He does not need to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. Her fraternity just shines right in her and her acting made her an Oscar nomination. Need I say that her poor health in this movie did not act? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was completed. This knowledge just puts more emphasis on the movie because it gets more into a Farnsworth homage. <br /> <br /> All this form is above a very beautiful motion picture that is appropriate for all kinds of people who love a movie in the ways they are supposed to do. One might ask for omeliness that is not obvious and somewhat naive but it does not ruin photographs in general, being that it is a memorable motion picture. 9/10.
