This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I was in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favorite and I doubt anyone could ever re-make the story of Oliver Twist on screen , any better than this one did. <br /> <br /> My favorite time '' bad guy '' must be done by Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did she scare the life out of me when I watched her as a 6 year old, but now as a woman I can spend more with character Nancys, bar / whore maid who helps Oliver get this life to which he deserves. > <br /> Jack Wilde as the artful winner, was fantastic, and I do not think anybody could ever out-do it, as the poker street-pocket, and best friend of Fagin. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's number, I am also very grateful to not give Bill Sikes a musical number, he would not work with him being such a disaster character. <br /> I think Carol Reed has done an excellent job in Nancy's sticky finish, keeping it a G rated movie by disguised beating her, but giving enough away to show the violence in Bill towards her. This film is both good, and charismatic as a singing-song, as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find his place in life.
