I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson but I must admit I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit disturbing and some edgy a bit bit, I do not know that this movie was a bit SF and a bit horror cut thriller.I saw this in about 2.00am or so on my local channel I had nothing else about so I decided to watch it. If you did not see this ID movie recommends reading it Not really that bad, the characters are interesting enough but do not really explore all the potentials that could make this movie even more better. I don, t know if this movie went to the movie but it felt like it was make for TV or go straight to the video, for one would buy this if it, on DVD it fits well with my kind of movie and has a little bit of the X-FILES story attached to it. The corporate governor or cereal corporation involving drugs transformation drugs. Generally a good film.
