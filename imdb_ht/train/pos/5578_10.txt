A hilarious and perspective perspective in the dating world is described by this comedy beating the first time writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds as the four protagonists meet each week in the local diner conferring on the dating woes. We meet Brad: a good-looking, mid-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp language; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: A sexually harassed guy with an affinity for hand cream and masturbation; and Eric: The bride guy, who likes his weekly encounters with his sole friends in the hope of his late boring existence and bold marriage. New York's trials and tribulation trials of being amusingly expressed, mirrored in the City's Sex and the new HBO comedy of Mind of the Married Man, and bring a silly light into scamming. The story takes a twist as the three Singletons meet Mia - wittily playing by Amanda Peet - and all fall for it. It seduces each and its puzzling ability to conform to their personality 'to show. When they came to realize they all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose him about their friendship. Hit is a realistic painting in the world dating, one that the critic failed to recognize. In plain language, they missed the point. The protagonist here is caricatures of real people. Exaggeration is hysterical, mixed satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the criticisms suggests suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from start to finish.
