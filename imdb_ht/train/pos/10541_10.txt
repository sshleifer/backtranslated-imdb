I thought this was an awesome movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bit bitterness I was at the start, when everything would have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is especially what I'm talking about. In addition, the movie was very creative. I think that all the act was well done, the actors were acting their character's personality perfectly. All fit together well. It really is a shame that is not a band. That would be good! Because this is a Canadian movie, and because it is one of my favorites, I give this movie a 10 out of 10!
