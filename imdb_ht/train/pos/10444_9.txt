Sweet and good, funny and intense, drawn less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film of Richard Linklater, dedicated to everyone who has ever been in love, is in love, or never was in love always dream of it and hope to find it. It is one of the many rare movies that is / should be / will also be interesting to adolescents, parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple little movie that has no spectacular visual effect, chase cars, or long sex scene with steam scenes. Two young people in the early 20s, two college students (Indian Ethan Hawke tourists who returned home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who went to Paris to attend classes in Sorbonne) encountered a train. They attract each other immediately even before they start talking, hop off the train in Vienna where they walk to explore the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It may have been boring and funny, but instead, it is a beautiful, creed, smart, and moving romance that only gets better with every look (at least, for this viewer). High praise and sincere gratitude go to the director and writer for delivering good characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogue, awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falls in love is. Julie Delpy, similar to Botticelli's angel, is great in intelligent, independent, and incredibly attractive young women.
