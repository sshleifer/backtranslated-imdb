Years ago, I found a "bin bargain" copy of this movie for a buck or two. In many ways, this is quite tight, as when it was back in 1933, it was really a movie made by the studio's "poverty range" studio, majestic. However, while the film is rather derivative, it is still well worth looking and gives a few surprises. The story is very, very familiar, as in some Germanic cities, people are angry because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires! Adding to this familiar is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - even though he plays a most innocent Weirdo. In this case, he was obsessed with his pet's bat, and people begin to blame him for their death. The film does a great job of giving some "red herrings" (ie, false driving) and while it does not take a genius figure out Frye can not be responsible, WHO and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average film supported. In addition, while the production had little money to talk about, he still had some good actors in the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and he also used Universal Studios lying at night (when they did filming for the day). As a result, the movie looks pretty good overall, though I thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was awful - thought it was not noticeable to the film's dismay. I saw him in more movies than most people on IMDb and I came to notice that his character has no depth - he always seems to be cast as the "screaming lady" and gives little to every movie. <br /> In general, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. For those who are NOT fans of the genre, it's probably pretty jump-able.
