This movie took my breath away at some point, I simply liked it! <br /> I admit that the character dialogues and scenarios could be a bit better, but hey, this is just a simple (brief) story of a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, nothing more it! <br /> The overall design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all just magical! <br /> There was plenty of love in this film. Cartoon characters were great and funny. A bit Tim Burton-eh if you like. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in great design, appearing in a simple, but beautiful story.
