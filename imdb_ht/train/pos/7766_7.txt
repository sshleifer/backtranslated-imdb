After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN on the WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said good-bye in his sister's sister role role and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same sort of tramp - and for her effort here in a very manipulative role, Malone won a better Oscar comedy support. <br /> <br /> The movie it's in is not quite up to Oscar's standard, but it's a strong melodram under the hands of the Douglas Circus. There is an almost noirish look at the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story with ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY Malon as their headliners. <br /> <br /> Domestic squatter among the wealthy family and an oil background are the main focus of the drama, with the emphasis on strong players supporting Stack and Malone. Both of them seized the opportunity with both hands and stack, too, should be given for his sterling work as weak, alcohol driven driving despair by his own wild motif. <br /> <br /> The nominal stars have less impressive work done, but do it with the usual skills and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play more sympathetic roles and quiet and understanding skills. The use of color is particularly striking (as it usually is in a circus movie) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking of the film as a Teknikolor film Noir in the vein of leaving it in the sky. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
