Grinch's part was made for Jim Carrey and I was very impressed with his performance. Not a big fan of her I was fearful but pleasantly surprised with the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest girl I saw on the screen for a long time and showed a mature beyond her years of acting skills. I was even drawn to tears at one point! I have never read Dr. Seuss in the story so I did not know what to expect, the humor was quite dark. In general, I liked the movie (apart from the songs!) And would recommend it, for families to look specifically.
