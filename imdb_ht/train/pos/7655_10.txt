Do not you see this film in about 20 years I'm always impressed with it's hard-hitting impact and great elegance. Of course, one Mr. Mickey Rooney is true, incredible in his role as the ring that leads "killer". (In reference to another review here-none other than Orson Welles evoked the name of Mickey Rooney as the greatest film actor, too.) I also note the jazzy-brazilian and dark and white scores. I love Mick's last line before going out for her dosage of lead poisoning. (I think the Stranglers have raised it for a line in one of the songs-Get a grip on yourself.) This is a great movie and unjustly bury film. Let's get it out! Note notes - A recent Review magazine film gave a great deal of Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", made a couple of years before "Last Mile" and also started Mickey Rooney. Another rave of Mick's intuitive and simplistic performance. Even at the beginning of a groundswell of appreciation for some Cinemas performance is really superior.
