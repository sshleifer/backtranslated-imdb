I will not lie. Although looking interesting, I looked at Bettie's Notorious pages because I was listening (and it was obviously just not a summary of anything about the movie), that Gretchen Mol got naked in her. I've never been a fan of Mol, but I can not resist seeing an attractive woman getting off her clothes. Yes, that can be perverted, but it's a central theme and ideal of the core of the film, and helps make the film a lot stronger than it probably should. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. He wants to be an actress, but he must also pay bill. After taking some seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, Page slowly becomes a model sensation, and quickly skips in suggestive pictures in provocative sexually explicit pictures. <br /> I feel the brighterness of the film (just about ninety minutes) is both a curse and a blessing. On one hand, the film never oversaw its welcome. You get to know Page in a few minutes, and then it gets right in her model career and does not look back. But he cursed the movie as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that's going on. It's just the kind of jump around between the model shoots and the controls that they create before jumping right into investigations of major senators who take a lot of the final act of the movie. You just sit there, and try to absorb it all, and more just happen to your right. It feels like the filmmakers wanted to resume too much material in too short a movie. It begs for longer sequence, and furthermore for further explanation. It does not feel rush; it just does not feel the whole. Another bit of a fumblish, although a bit more of a curiosity, is the use of color throughout the movie. The majority is in black and white, but often, flying and sequencing from color to exit. But while this can be done as a symbolic gesture early, it gets a bit of a distraction as it always pops up later on before cutting back to black and white. It gets confused, and gets more of a tiring interference than anything else as the movie goes on. While it may fall slightly with the actions, the movie remains dead-on with its theme. Page, who I know little is nothing about, is the innocent play, and her world is exactly the same. Saved for a few shady characters during her teens, everyone she encounters is an innocent, and everything she does has an innocence. I never thought I would look at full nudity as it was something else other than vulgar and sin, but here, it really is something to be surprised at. All at once, it is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually perverted moments in the movie (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling. There is just something about the whole body of the mole's mole is to describe it just to hit in like a different code than naked bodies of other films. It just feels so natural and so beautiful, that if there was no reason to watch the movie, it would be to see the Spectacular Spectacular Mol's bodies as it plays Bettie Page. <br /> <br /> Another reason is Mol itself. As a page, it exemplifies that all Belle 1950's everyone knows (or may at least imagine). Despite his profession, he is still a normal person, and always looks at himself as being religious. Mol play exactly it's the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness to make this character genuine feel from the 1950s. She plays it with the-of-faitness things that you might be hard-set by thinking that Mol was actually Bettie Page itself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supporting cast has so many moments to shine, and they are fully overshadowed by the wonderful Mol's performance. None of them are doing anything particularly fun, and none of them really have the same strength in their role as Mol do. This is not really the fault of the actors, but more in the fact that they do not have much to work with. Many of them are fully recognized, such as Oscar-candidate David Strathairn (in a role near one of his best performances), Sarah Paulson (recent Golden Globe candidate for Studio 60 on the Sunset Band), and characters actor Lili Taylor, but you should be hard to put really put their performance into being anything other than hiccups. None of these characters are really developing, and they really just stand as cut-outs characters that Mol runs loops around as it picks up steam in its brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Really, this film is refreshing for its paintings in nudity, and for Gretchen Mol's excellent performance in Bettie Page. Everything else is a bit too trapped and awkward than it should be. There was more work they had done to develop supported characters and not just exploding right into the story, this movie would have a better biographical film. As it stands, it is just a Mol for cars really riding in the stratosphere of popularity as an actress. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
