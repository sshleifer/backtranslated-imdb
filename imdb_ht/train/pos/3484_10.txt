This is just the best movie of all time! Padon, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's, as soon as it appeared on the Bulgarian TV, and I liked it immediately (I was 14 then). 25 years later I bought it on a video tape, and a few months ago she finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this film 35 years already, and so do all my friends and family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, he liked it immediately, too (and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and not talking or understanding Russian at all !). What makes this Danelia chief so special? It's hard to say, as it's difficult to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch these dozens of films twice with the pleasure as it was the first time. I can not remember any other films, no matter how many million dollars it cost or how big the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
