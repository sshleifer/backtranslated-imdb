This is your music comedy standard from '30, with a bigger plus that it features some well known' actor 30 in the funk's fun fun. <br /> <br /> There is not much of the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and 'no-worry' general type of atmosphere, and a typical Hal Roach comedy touching it. Apparently it's a 'Cinderella story' but I most certainly did not think of it this way while watching the movie. The story becomes very wounded in the story, which features many different characters and also many small appearance devices, when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios. Of course the film highlight is when Laurel & Hardy makes their appearance and shows some of the routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free. Also Laurel & Hardy Regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine with James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as the director of the short. It is certainly true that all of the canoe and subplots are distracted from the main line of character and character but in this case with no problem, since all its ways are more fun and interesting to look over the main plot line and features the main typical fund. The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre film in the same time period, though the rating over here would suggest otherwise. <br /> 7/10
