The star of this movie is the scenario. Attention to detail for the period of clothing, language, social life (we do not hurt women) and politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo in the day. The subtle pieces of the action scenes are for an attentive viewer and choreography in the sequence of actions is superb. Maybe this movie is close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. It is such a staircase for increased violence and pause to stand in peace and tranquility between every step. A great movie.
