A documentary without a word loss ... ever ... <br /> Let's assume that the narration is more than a parody, let's assume it is a commentary on Japanese society. And as this film is as fast as a absurdist documentary as it comes, the word is constant, as fast it goes, and as badly translated as it is - in its version now screener festival as seen tonight in Copenhagen The Cinematek - It's always quite enjoyable. <br /> But for the patient, ONLY with the patient really patient and open-minded, I'm talking to you Jim Jarmusch fans and ADD relax, I believe this is a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you allow it to win you. <br /> <br /> Pretty, well-brushed, and Japanese sub-culture. And quite experimental. 2D stats in a 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that spoofs Japanese food culture. A thumb if you are in the mood for something completely different.
