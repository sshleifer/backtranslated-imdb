Real fan of movie will love this movie. <br /> I do not agree with the trolls that movie this one-star movie and call it unrealistic. While I do not have the background or out of the environment at the protagonists, I spent many years working at lower income and working class neighborhoods and feeling the act was very real and representative of how teens behave . I do not know which basis is for other people's comments that are "unrealistic". The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> The low cost production budget did not bother me a bit. I felt that the natural lighting increased the movie's character. The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy propping or melodrama. I was completely bought into motivation of the character and reaction. The act was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you enjoy good drama characters, then see it. (Regarding the negative comments being "troll": click on the name and you will see most no other reviews or just negative reviews.)
