The core story is here, Aditiya (Kumar) is the son who is spoiled by a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in the eyes of Ishwar Aditha, his son can do anything wrong, Aditya mom Sumitra ( Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring her son to the responsibility of the path before it's too late, for Ishwar is a patient in lung cancer and has only 9 months to live, when her son elopes and married Mitali (Chopra) Ishwar easily forgives Aditya, but when the Aditya happy couple and Mitali returned from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, with Aditya's kickback from the house making him more responsible, Aditya does not know his dad suffers from cancer Lung, and he also does not know that his father was chasing him out of the tire making him more responsible, Ishwar could not bring himself to Aditya's height that he was about to die, and a hungry and pregnant wife. It is a race against time so Aditya does everything he can to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die. <br /> <This movie is absolutely brilliant, this is the American movie tool that needed for the Bollywood industry, Shah's direct is almost flawless, but that movie does not have any flaws? The best part of this film is the father's son's relationship with a tearjerker. The song interludes are just set at the right time, the landscape is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav joke are too long and after a bit they are annoying, but the This general is a brilliant movie, I advise anybody Reading this review and watching it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
