The movie I loved since my youth! Its excellent. Although, it may be a bit too much for the average film smoker if someone can not interpret certain intricacies of the movie (for example, our hero's name is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander he's shot the heel and a rocket, as Achilles in mythology fired at his heel). That's just a little bit of fun! Anyway, great movie, good story, it would be their own to see it redone with special effects today! Strangely enough, Gary Graham was the average success, starting at T.V. show the alien nation. This movie is a fun look and should be more appreciated!
