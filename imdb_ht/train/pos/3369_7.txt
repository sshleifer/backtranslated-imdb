Despite that the title may mean, "Swine is pig" by star Porky pig. Instead, it features a young pig and a more insatiable appetite than John Belushi's character in "Animal House". Her mother repeatedly reprimanded her, but she does not. So much so that it goes to another home where a scientist denanged his strength-food more than any mortal can only handle (but there's a surprise to the end). <br /> I would especially say that this cartoon seemed like a holder of places in between the really great cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after this out). But make no mistake about it, and do some things that are right here. The whole force-feed sequence seems more important today, providing overeating outbreaks of our country. <br /> In every way, by the older cartoon, but worth seeing.
