I went to see Ashura as the 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one fresh hit. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, he's still in Japan ... Oh Lord I hope he gets better and makes many other movies. It's very simple, but somewhat original ... The spirits are roaming at Edo in Japan and Swordsmans are called "Demon Wardens" to kill them and fear the rebirth of Ashura, the goddess goddess of sleep and supposedly is very kick-ass. /> <br /> It brings us Izumo ... there are some types of eagle swords called "demon slayer" and his friend Jaku in the typical violent stupid jealous ... <br /> Seems boring? Well now he thinks .... <br /> Izumo has retired from killing spirits since he killed a kid on the "impression" that he was demon, he never knew, but he had to kill him. So, Izumo went with his life and recycled himself in theater kabuki. In a beautiful joyride on a beautiful night, Izumo spotted a girl hidden on a bridge and changed his life and resumed kill half ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... guy It is known how to handle a sword and pull a fun massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo brings the movie as far away as playing it ... it's the total package ... he knows how to fight (hell yeah he knows), it's witty, it is clever and he's there are gravel. You never need to call: "NO IZUMO, IT'S A TRAP" The guy already knows he has this sense of meaning. It's really the perfect hero. As far as movie goes, the aesthetics are very interesting. It's far, the movie that looks much more like a manga. It's full cream of special effects and nothing, at all costs will prevent this movie to look realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Much of the color of a "real" photography, other than that ... it's pretty straightforward ... but as I said, the main character is carrying the movie A must see, a lead but not self-mastery
