] Never seen this movie? Not even heard of this movie? It would not surprise me. One of the truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio has been trusted in the photo and has never been picked up for larger distribution. Independent Films, Films, gave Boesman and Lena a very limited run and virtually no promotion, and the majority of critical movie critics did not even bother to review it. I guess a movie based on one act, a series of plays on the apartheid and affect it on those who never really had a chance in the market today - and it's the smart movie-lover's loss. Films, Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve Ocsar nominations (such as the movie was made), but the film got as little fanfare that I can not even blame the academy on one. This is a film that is difficult, think-provoking, and heartbreaking, and it actually asks the audience to meet her on her own theme. Taking this into consideration, it's definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to play Athol Fugard's dress-up. Sure, we're giving some reflexes to fracture with some scenic scenic shots, but the movie version of BOESMAN and LENA remains, on the whole, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. The basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to go hand in hand with each other. A third character joins them temporarily (Willie Jonah, amazingly in a largely silent role), but the movie's advice never loses out of the title characters and what they have become. Bassett and Glover provide brave performances as the broken couple, performance that simply can not improve on. Cruel and brutally interesting, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN and LENA deserve to be rediscovered in their home video. Hands down, the best movie of the year 2000.
