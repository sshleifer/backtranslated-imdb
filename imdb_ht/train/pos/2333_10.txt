I just started watching this show, and I must say that it really makes me laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, and everything else. Some others say this should be more realistic reaction to the deceased, among other things. If you are going to accept that Ned can bring back the dead back to life, you have to accept that other bits are completely crazy in the show. I could not help smile after every episode I watched. I really think it's great to have a show out there that can take a very strange topic and really make it great to watch. I absolutely love the narration, I think it adds that extra bit of wonder the entire show. You can not always compare old shows by a writer to his new, you must take everything as it's own entity. Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
