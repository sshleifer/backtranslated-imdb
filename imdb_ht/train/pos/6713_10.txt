I liked to show this TV because it was something of a girl who is about sixteenth birthday to find that she is a witch and she is living with her akunties at home and both witches too. Well this took him a few weeks to getting used to. When he used his power for the first time he was so funny because he turned his enemy into a pineapple. He turned back and repeated a day. This series is really cool and it's a typical gene range but it's been minced when it moves out of his home and in an apartment with his fellow colleagues friends and then it's boring and I stop watching. His Aunties love was so funny and the other one was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and I hated Libry Sabrina's enemies she was ugly.
