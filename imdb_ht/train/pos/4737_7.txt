Hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call a ballet with points and explosions. Make sure the plot tried and heard before, (An ingenious biological fate that is part of an elite fighting force in supermen that decides it feels that kill and brutal forces are not ways to solve everything and become a peaceful, and a librarian but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to find an antidote that will keep them alive when taken over by police-this best friend is a copy-it becomes the black mask.) in go for, very visual, work and at least for me is fun. I love a martial arts movie that is a spectacle. People flying lighter than the time and recovering a second split after the impact of holding the pace and action that does not stop. But that's what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of Jet It does what he does best, and that's spectacular display of his skills, which says at least is toothache. Like most of the fast-acting martial arts actions. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung are just now showing themselves here in their first state, these movies are low on plot and high on astounding physical facts. But I must say, even with the big holes left in the draw (like how we see him safely in his apartment when one scene before he had 20 people not more than 15 feet in his hands and sign in the escape scene just just cut it into the apartment ... Ohh quite suspended from my beliefs guess), the film I'm still interesting. Only up to the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could be a little shorter. But still all around a movie huge rhythm action.
