This is a comedy of moral, so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs, but a slightness sucks all sarcasm and irony flows until all a sudden suddenly one will stop your heart and change everything. , wonderful writing and directing, is a gem that glows perfectly, and beautifully acts by all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual, and Romy Schneider is a perfect, glowing, glowing, not to be missed. A really wonderful movie!
