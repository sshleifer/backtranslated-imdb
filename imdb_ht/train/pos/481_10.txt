This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. Perhaps this is because Gorris took Nabokov's initial idea and gave them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view about Luzhin who dignifies him more than the one Nabokov. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie that I do not like is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhin's destination. I can not imagine Nabokov creating someone like Valentinov and giving him great influence on the Roman act.
