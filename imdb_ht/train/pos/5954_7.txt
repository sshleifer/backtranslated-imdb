I feel out of a blend of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reaction of this film. Yes, there are stereotypes vampires. Yes, scientific stereotypes are covered here. Even martial art stereotypes. All good and good, and make sure, not all perfectly done. However, I feel an important point on this film was neglected ... cultural significance in its place. The movie is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid that. This is a bold move in the movie world today, and a rare treat for fans of Indy film. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world renowned as a marine city, a city of aviation, a city of wood, and sometimes even as a hotbed for conflict politics. Rarely is it seen as a growing movie city. But that's all right now. More films are coming to shoot. And more authentic Pensacolians discover the power of movies for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend of independent film based Pensacola, and more on the road. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by and by, the world is getting more attention. Watch and listen, world. Pensacolians are coming. Such a virus.
