This is a very, sweet, and complicated movie that unravels slowly, revealing detailed details, such as paying attention to a novel, and watching this film "is" like watching a woman unfold. While I did not care for the narrator, as I felt it was out of balance with the rest of their performance, this movie features some of the best acting ensembles I've ever seen, and the lead, summer Phoenix, it's awesome. His innocence and some naughty may find implausible, sort of a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that criticism, but it's still fabulous, partially because it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. This film is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique on this film is how it never shows what you would expect. It's always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals much more than it needs. In 163 minutes, it's very short, in a fault, I'd say, that's one of the wonders of this movie. It's full of short moments that are simply stunning, some of the best you are most likely to see all year, and all of these moments add up to the end of an extraordinary movie experience. Families are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie said about the theater was not seen in film since Cassavetes' "Night Opening," or perhaps the "Limelight" Chaplin. But believe it or not, this movie is very much "less" conventional. I never knew where this film was going, and now she saw it, it still has multiple possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative movie.
