Three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, monsoons, and bad moods. Interesting and well done; This style of film always makes me wonder where facts leave off and imagination take on. Though these are the scum on the ground I always find myself pitying them. They never really stand much at a chance.
