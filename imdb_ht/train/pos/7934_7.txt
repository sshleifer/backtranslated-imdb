According to this table, I guess you either love it or hate it. Usually how it goes with all movies. There is no need to get testy with others though. All we are doing here is giving opinions. I rent this movie last night and I want to come and throw my opinion into the mix. I was surprised by how many people are launching it though. There's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a fan of movie horror. Most plain though 'movie fans do not like horror movies. So many low-budget cam corder buddies will come out these days. It's hard to keep. And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come up with a review of "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is very damn good compared with the rest of the junk out there. It's nothing special but it's these horrors movie makers who try too mischievously end up making a horrible horrible horror movie. I really like this one. You tell me there is no effort in this one? And one more thing, I bet all you have all those great DVD collection that you are so proud of, nothing but Big Picture Movement right? There is nothing wrong with that, but you must know how to value low-budget self-sufficiency. I knew what I got when I watched this movie. I'm not going to be upset because I thought he was going to make some 100 million films. Some of you might need to stick and watch the uterus over and over again and stop trying to compare things to the matrix. But if most of you are under 24, explaining everything. Good movie folks, check it out.
