Whoopi was the only reason I looked at the Oscars this year. It is hilarious. Of course, there was a bigger side of the show. It was great not only because it was funny, but because he said some things need to be said in a public forum. The white seeds need to be reminded that ceremonies, works, and Hollywood pricing representations are WAY out of balance racially. There should be no need to show "black" awards. White-pen, nominee and judges need to bring themselves to the sun and see that the great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was deep in the poor taste. He had no business being there. The fact of the problem is, this is the first Oscar presentation I've been looking at since the "Purple" was up for awards. This miscarriage of votes sucked me on watching the shows until 2002. Which is not delegating other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot.
