As a single horse lover can only appreciate this movie. There are some movies that show chinni as this one does. I would like to know if Brian makes her own up in the movie. He would also like to know if he likes the horses. Brian was in a lot of movies where he got up dog. Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is hard for me to take is that the scenes rise are still full of tilt, as a horse can run forever in steam. The camera-work is the first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse's head. It would be very interesting to know how to go about casting this film to get all the pretty good riders.
