"Scoop" is easy to film in Woody Allen in 2000 so far. Allen, although ultimately looking at her, is at the top of her toy as a low-brow magician Sidney Waterman. Its one-piece material and their attitude are hilarious. Do not let criticism convince your opinion. "Scoop" is a top-notch "Woody-Lite" photo. <br /> <br /> Classic music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen. Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in this bath suit. Jackman is superbly. Cinematography is growing. "Scoop" is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish. The last shot in the movie alone is worth the admission cost.
