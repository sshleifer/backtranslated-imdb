This movie is a bell of fun rock punk, from start to finish. The Ramones, ruling chief at the late-70s punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Sol star as Riff Randle, rebel high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Rif is obsessed with song songs for Ramones, his favorite band. He holds rockin school, and encourages fellow students to join him in his joyous antics. <br /> While the school is Riff gone, she just hired a new brand director, named Madam Togar. It's a tall, intimidating Amazon at a woman. And he promised to do the students' toes. She even has a couple of students acting as monitors, who report back to her and dirt on their peers. Mrs. Togar is specifically determined for Riff Nab, and puts a stop to Riff's anarchy shenanigans. But Reef has smart ways to make Falun Togar, at every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos in superb performance Mari Woronov, in his role as Director Togar. Mary is a legendary film actress B. And in this movie, she plays Madame Togar's fascist, and sneaky relish. PJ Solo as Reef, turning into an electrical performance. Clint Howard as Eaglebauer's duplicitous, is very fun with his role. Ramones are doing lots of hit songs in this movie. So the viewer saw why the Ramones were so influential, at the rock punk rock scene 70s. Certainly, this is a good movie for fans of Ramones. But even if you do not enter Ramones, or rock punk, this movie is a terrific explosion (literally) of energetic fun.
