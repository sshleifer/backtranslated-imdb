Wow! So much fun! Probably a lot for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this kid's movie, this movie reminds me a bit a bit of time bandits - lots of Terry Gilliam all the way to . While the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, Miike still throws in a lot of surreal and Bunuel-esquire times. All the first act of juxtapose violence from the scenes scene to the normal family life of the main kid / hero, and the world of evil and evil happening there is. And while the finish has a bit of a common light aspect of Miike's work, the layers of significance and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is very damn intensely. As fascinating and imaginative of fun like other great Miike films, only instead of the top and gore torture, it gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk-lore creativity conceived via CG and puppetry wrap in an adventure imaginative multi-varied. There is clothing, and one of the best best!
