This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupation lies at the time he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who leases a Parisian apartment where the tenant before committing suicide. She becomes obsessed with discovering what brought her to him, to the point that she was dressed in dragging and reenacting the road event could be unfolded. The film is disturbing at one point, and it has the atmosphere of screaming dread that Polanski excels in, but it comes too much as a rehash in the "Baby Rosemary" and "Repulsion," the other two other Polanski films that deal with going they are unheard of over Moody's apartment. But, as for the concentration .... unless I read too much of the film, I must believe that this reaction to Polandia was the feelings of persecution he felt of marking a sexual pervert and capturing out in America. Do not make a judgment on it one way or the other myself, but it is difficult to deny this evidence of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
