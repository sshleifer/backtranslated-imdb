I'm surprised that movies like this can still happen. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Never think that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it over and over. Washington, charismatic and intense as ever, plays Kreasy, a former-counter-terrorist-savior agent who was taken to the bottle. Once he was assigned to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico, her emotional and retroactive arc is jumping in the only way an adorable little girl can provide. Inevitably, later is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take his character Teddy-bear character. Yes, it came ... someone on fire. <br /> You must see this movie.
