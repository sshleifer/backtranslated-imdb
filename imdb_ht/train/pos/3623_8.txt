Disney might be just about something here. First, they were "Remember the Titans" and Denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small city among America. Now with Quaid and the rookie ... yet another story story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel all hot after seeing them. My wife and I took in the rookie and we hope she must be a great feel of good quality movie. We did not let down, when asked if we should buy this on DVD when it came out, it was an arm-no. Most definitive.
