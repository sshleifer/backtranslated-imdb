Maybe the last movie you would expect from Vittorio de Sika and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this movie was based). It is a neorealist fantasy, the kind of an oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises her as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a boy (called Toto) and the foster mother is dying. She goes to an orphanage and, when she finally has 18, she leaves. Immediately she finds that she has no home. Toto is optimistic, though, and will not let anything get him down. A man robbed his responsibilities, and instead of becoming angry about it, Toto became his friend and went and stayed with him in a small shantytown. Toto took some initiatives and organized many homeless people living in the area and built a better Shantytown. Soon, landowners are trying to sell this plot of land, and the citizens of Shantytown have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner has a police force to get rid of homelessness. At this point, the film becomes full of genuine fantasy (before it was more comedian / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This is so strange and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves. It's very amazing, and very funny. There are objections you might be raising on the plot of Miracle in Milan, most certainly. Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they began to lose their neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. At that point, though, it's so enjoyable - I loved it very much. It might be my favorite movie in the Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and the boot robbers come very, very close. 10/10.
