Excellent political gossip, played much quieter and slower than other, higher ranking films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how to manage jumping on these amazing career performances? A tale of friends, father-son relationships, corruption and trumpet. The actors of players amazingly well together, with their support from Aiello and Fonda are equally as impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the paper runs in press. Instead of focusing on a complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure of a political corruption, the final scenes and each of the main characters are beautiful writing and acting.
