I really liked this movie ... it was nice. I loved it, but if you did not, that's your fault. Emma Roberts has played a good Nancy Drew, though she's not quite like the books. The old fashioned outfits are strange when you see them in modern times, but it looks good on them. For me, the wealthy girls did not have teams that made them look rich. I mean, it seems to have got all the clothes -blindfolded- in a garage and just decided to put it all over. All of the teams were remarkable, especially when pennies were pennyed with regular teams. I do not want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely was not! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will enjoy it!
