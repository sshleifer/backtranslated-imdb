I remember seeing this film years ago about, I think, BBC2. I would like to see it again - anyone knows how to get a copy? As I remember, it was a specially powerful film, in particular the scene that stands out in the horse wearing masks. Apart from that I really can not remember too much about the story - which is why I want to see it again! I've been trawled the web but I can not find a copy, which is strange in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS in this film on the market. Would appreciate any help anyone can give me on that. Thank you very much for your assistance. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
