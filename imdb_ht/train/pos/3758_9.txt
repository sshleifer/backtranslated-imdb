This movie is awesome. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; However, it's the number of "dudes" and "right ounce" to bring laughs and souvenir memories of about 15 years ago. I love her ability to make me simply chuckle in obvious jerk and silliness, and her ability to make me want to watch her predecessor, "Bill and Excellent Ted's Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a full movie of many jokes, and totally mature humor, do not watch it; However, if you want a movie that is funny and funny, but intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. I actually want more of this sort of photo appeared in today's theater. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves acting way everyone to parody him like acting ... right ... do not get better than that :)
