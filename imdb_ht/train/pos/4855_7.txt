The question of whether one likes this movie version of the "Ghost Train" consistently depends on one thing and one thing alone: ​​your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> It tends to fly almost every stage it is in, and not always in a great way. Sometimes you want it to settle down or back in just a little, to allow many characters of the draw to introduce and develop (which they make to some extent). But somehow everything keeps pointing to Tommy Gander's character Tommy Gander. <br /> I personally love the movie, and even like Askey at a level. I always seem to be taking it to the VCR in those odd hours in the early morning when I can not sleep and really can not get the energy to watch anything else. There is something about watching the old b / w movie theater in the quiet dawn of pre-dawn that I get appealed.
