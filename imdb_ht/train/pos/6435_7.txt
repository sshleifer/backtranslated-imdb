I think most of the folks who posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First, to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the movie works together. Modern sensitivity requires great drama. No, I do not mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to ask emotional tractors that are very tragic or very comedy. This is a subtle movie. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the simple characters of this movie. It's a very well-filmed film that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, vernality or her name. The world she set in would be alien and does not understand today ... a world where if you have it you have flaunt it now and LOUDLY, even if you only think you have it. <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian as people understand today's terms. <br /> <br /> This movie helps set the record straight.
