In general, I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to independent film lovers. <br /> However, I really want to remember the similarities between this movie part and Nichols' closer. A scene especially where Adrian Grenier's character encounters Rosario Dawson about her sex life while far away is remarkably similar to the scene in the nearest place where Clive Owen's character encounters Julia Roberts, although she is acting less heavily and intensely in " love. " Also note that "Anna" is the name of both Dawson and Roberts' characters. Can not coincidence. Now is closer to Patrick Marber's play and supposedly this film is the injuries based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen" so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has an idea?
