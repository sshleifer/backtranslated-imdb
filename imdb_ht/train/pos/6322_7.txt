This movie was recommended for me not a friend. I never saw an ad or trailer, so I did not know Clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought to throw at all was inappropriate, and found the movie very enjoyable, all at all. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing by the road, whipping and haggard, keeps my attention immediately. He had a way to tell you, "Do not go away, this will not be boring," and he really did not. It turned out to be an interesting, light-hearted comedy with twisting enough and turning to keep you in your chair at the very end, but when the finish came, I felt a bit cheated .... just a little little. The events keep building so that you hope to continue building, but at one point I can not define, it sort of level out, to make a slight disappointment. I figured I expected a bigger bang in a climax, but it turned out the sort of key low. If you watch the movie with this in mind and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should get this movie very fun and well worth watching. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
