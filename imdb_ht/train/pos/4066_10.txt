Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, brings joy to the storytelling of the audience. It's kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid anymore; it's just magic. It's a crime that it has taken so long ago that it must be released in the states, but now that it's here to check it out! With stick and original language; The dub changed my impressions of the characters a bit, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or books, whatever.) <br /> I give it a ten / ten.
