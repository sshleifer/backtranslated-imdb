I was very young then from the U.S., but I registered it on TV and watch it over and over again until I had everything to memorize. At that day I always catch myself quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. Voice were great, and sounded just like the characters showed. Mary was also well done, although slightly creepy. I was surprised to find out recently that he was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor in the nose, a show that I am very dear. Like someone else who wrote in a comment earlier, I was stolen from this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I'm sure there was enough demand for this show to guarantee a DVD release, but I do not think there are enough people who have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-Bay ...
