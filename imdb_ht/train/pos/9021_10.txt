my self and 2 sisters to watch all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the best BBC series.The entire cast was very compelling in the parts they showed and although the 3rd series was a The slowest bit it was compelling look and the evening I had the same without it. And doubt we'll look it again as it is a series that I would never get sick of watching.Excellent look and full brand the BBC for such a brilliant and timely series. The first rate in all departments and this series would be recommended to anyone although some age limits should be considered because of some adult material. Be thankful in the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and video.
