This is the movie I've seen more times than any other (I believe I've seen it average once a year since it was released). And every time I see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most likely a combination of the best ever had in ancient Yu sinema. This movie is an absolute must for every movie lover respecting herself. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of all movies should have in his private video collection.
