I absolutely love this movie! I was reluctant to look at it first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how difficult it was when John was shot. However, watching "Two of us" took me back to a happier moment when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did an amazing job describing what "might be." Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the head of challenge. I was impressed with accent and styling him. Jared Harris is also very talented and well-liked as John. My favorite part was the scene of the park and the three scenes - that was so intense. The movie left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of them I feel are inappropriate, given the circumstances.
