Back in the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the Lost World. <br /> At this end, the five people were led by Challenger back to the tray where a group started drilling for oil that threatened to destroy the country. Gomez has something to do with that. They managed to defeat the drillers and the tray save, lots of fun of the natives. As in the world lost, what some dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner deny their role as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are also back .. Although it has several bad reviews and those looking cheap rubber dinosaurs, i Enjoying the Lost World Cup. <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
