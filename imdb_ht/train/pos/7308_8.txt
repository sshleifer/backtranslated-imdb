With a simplistic story and a heroine engaged, this movie was the horror that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a nightly night-watch on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her first, quarantined role role) and her mischievous friend plans a night of fun-sneaky fun at crossing the path with a relentless psychopath from hell. Michael Myers escaped from a nearby Crazy Soldier ... he killed his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back to Haddonfield, sleeping in the Illinois city where murder has taken place. Once he looked down at Laurie after he went down to a pack in the abandoned house where he had lived, he started blue stalk with his terrorist, turning his night into fun in horror as he chose anyone on the road read to get to it. br>> Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this horrible awesome awesome movie Moody ... and the gloomy long shots she still feels like if you're backed by the maniacal assassin series himself. Myers hide well until completely revealed in the interesting conclusion. Although "Halloween" is certainly obsolete, it is no less mean refrigeration. The idea alone is bullshit bullshit induced, and this little shocker is one of the most popular and memorable horror movies ever made to this day ... it spawned seven sequels and eventually Rob Zombie's same scary remake and It puts a new standard for horrors that still exist today.
