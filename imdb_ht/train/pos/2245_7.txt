Salva and Bigardo his pals were in the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car in the underground, where the locations get donations so lame and no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a stubborn criminal petty does not even have any kind of redemption, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religions and business shows prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalized on. He and Bigardo were in jail after the accident death of a priest who was critical of the duo. Salva shows it is a natural reality show. It transforms itself into a Christlike figure as an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a woman-no-show producer of the show, can not escape from Salva's way to pay attention to her weirdness. Ultimately, Salva is victim of his own success at the end. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first directive of this film, has had some success in how the movie satirizes the role of television. Spain, who was vulnerable to these kinds of programs, saw its part of the scarcity, which is what the director felt was an attack on the public watch and wanted to put his story into the point of view of the people who make a fortune from the naive audience. The cast of ensembles has some good moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decided to direct his first feature, would be more effective to focus on the camera's front picture. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest respond well to the new director.
