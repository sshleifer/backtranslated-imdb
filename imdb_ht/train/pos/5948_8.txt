Some of the posters seem less gruntled because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly does not pretend to be either. You will look a long way to get a bigger Rodgers and Hart fans than me but Burke and Van Heusen did not exactly cut times in addition to being known to the Bingle inside out and preparing some great songs - Handsome, Moonlight Come to you, It's Still You, The Day Forever, etc. - To fit her very personal style, it's here to come up with yet another fine - and unjustly overlooked - ballads, Once and for Still, more a couple In optimistic philosophy-lite enter If You load your toes on the moon and handle not doing anything. The delicate conspiracy does not mean to be taken seriously - why else makes Merlin a heavy air at most, if not all, in the other versions it is more a friend / adviser to Arthur - so if you start shouting why Sir Lancelot has been sold to historians as the epitome of Knights and metamorphoses of the bully bully you will not find much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. On balance she does what she sets out to do, enjoy, good luck to her.
