I first saw this back in the early 90's on UK television, I did like it then but I missed the luck tape, many years passed but the movie still stuck with me and I lost hope to see it TV again, the main thing that stuck with me was in the end, the part of castle mansion really touched me, it's easy to look, there's a big story, great music, the list goes on and on, it's ok I say how good it is but everyone will take to have their own best bits go with them once they've seen it, yes the animation is top and beautiful teeth to watch, it shows its age at a pretty part Some but now have become part of it's beauty, I am so happy it came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time. Buying it or renting it just to see it, better look is at night alone and drink and eat at the end so you do not have to stop the movie.
