One of my favorite shows in the 80's. After the first season, he started going down when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to throw. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and she was pleased to watch her with Ernest Borgnine's character to visit her with each other. The last episode he appeared to was one of my favorites for the second quarter. Sadly during those days, black did not last long on TV shows. Some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third quarter was more about the human character than Airwolf and has not been shown until nearly the end of the show. When he went to USA, he was lousy !!!
