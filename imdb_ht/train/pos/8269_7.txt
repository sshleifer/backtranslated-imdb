I was intrigued by this film for a while, in part because of the incredibly high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 and more than 300 votes gave it the highest rating of any movie that is accessible in silence! How did I not hear from this movie before this website? Well, you can not always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good movie, preserved well if the VHS fine I rented is any indication - excellent acting by the principals, especially William Haines as Brown, and working good at Cambridge with some fine footage in Harvard the climate / yale football game - but the story must have seemed a beary chastnut even in 1926. Obnoxious, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in place, gets into the caring process, self sacrificing friends; I doubt people in 1926 found so much that were really interesting to the last few coils, the predictability factor is high. Still, it starts out very well, and it is certainly worth remembering, if not praise the sky. Maybe the voters before 350 are mostly Harvard people ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score has actually gone up over 9.2! Seriously, as there are ballots-stuffs going on here - I challenge anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or the "General"!
