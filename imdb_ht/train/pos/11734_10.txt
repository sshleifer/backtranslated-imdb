This has to be one of my favorite flicks, unlike Hamlet's Elvira Hills' ... nevertheless I love the movie way is a goth / com 's wizard of Oz' ... <br / > Elvira is a Dorothy goth who is trapped in a town familiar after the death of a good witch (elvira Tante Morgana) ... he inherited a very powerful Ruby ring and was sought after by the Warlock (His Uncle). .. He befriends four characters that he inadvertently helps to grow in the entire movie while there with a dog in tow. There is a show down with his uncle (the wicked Witch in the West) where Elvira realizes that he has the strength to him and ends up defeating him. At the end it is sent to by the popular cities after they have on their hearts and finally become their destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). There are many references made to the wizard of Oz in the movie ... he and his uncle both line lines related to parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be A Em A, and you must be Uncle Remus .... No place like house, no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'm going to find you pretty, with your little dog too!" There is a sign that Elvira passes the first time on his road trip to the state of Kansas. /> <br /> But, on the contrary, the fact that one of the sequences it "torn off, um ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance" is engineering more ... and if you do not roll around the street he titty twirling at the end of his "80 very" Las Vegas show then you do not have to lift a bone to your body ... This movie is a Classic / Classic Classic
