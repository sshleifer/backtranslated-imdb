In the hands of younger actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could become funny and frank. But with those having experienced thespians leading the way, I found "Silent Wrath" to be a most interesting and fun little mystery. When the marriage is cut off by an alien who claims that Colbert is already married, and that he was the best person in this marriage, one can feel that there are some sort of conspiracy against him to work. As Colbert, Ryan, and his lawyers set out to disprove the alien claims of a previous marriage, they meet at every turn no further evidence that strengthens the claim that it is true already married. Although it is not very difficult to figure out just that the main "baddie" is, it's still much fun as the intensity and speed of the story increases. All in all, a good, solid mystery movie and fine performance by the two leading actors and a fine casting support that often includes the Communicate Paul Kelly.
