Rock n Roll is a Dirty Business with DiG! demonstrate this mastery. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps deficit, the film maker can be reminded of seven years of agitation following the group of sick people. With that said, the abundance of quality materials ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you've ever been interested in any domain in the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a watched look. The music of the film, although it suffers from minimal cuts from collapsing cuts and glued, is worth the cost of admission alone. The following morning I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown massacre album (I had already initiated in the sounds Warhols' sound). Essentially defined in his exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. DiG! is a sincere, and sufficient goal, look at the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process with those who try to control these forces.
