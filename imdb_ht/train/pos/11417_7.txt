This movie has hit me as a project that has a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not quite come along. I do not know who did it, but it has a little Disney-esque feel. While its part is incredible (such as a pre-adolescent run for a public office) and tends to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a normal dose of health (all that is) keeping things they are balanced and out of perspective. Acting is good. Strange, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... at. It's interesting to see how she worked hard to maintain a balance between her best friend, grandmother, and her passion: ballet and baseball. When a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to see Frankie trying to keep her own on a team of boys, but she did a great job to show the struggle he was facing. I read somewhere that it is not really ballerina, but the correction of this movie has done a very good job of doing her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. In general, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its stars Mischa Barton did not quite realize the level of realism we had seen during its performance at "Lawn Chen", "Lost and Delirious", and Opposing Small Performance but it's shocking Haley Joel Osment in the "6th Sense."
