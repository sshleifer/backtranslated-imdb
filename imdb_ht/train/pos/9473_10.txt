I was lucky enough to see this in a pre-screening last night (October 20) and I was extremely surprised at the wonderful and hearty plot really felt to act. While the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels cool, unique, and distinctly "Indy" in style. It is not something that can be easily compared to the past movie, it's a unique take on a sort of classical middle age that has depressed love stories. <br /> I was particularly hit by casting in the movie. Down to every supplement of the family, it was a nice and talent throw. The three daughters did a great job, they were talented to dispute between them and none of them "out-shine" the other two. loudly funny while also being really touched and warmhearted. It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.
