I saw this time on the wonderful world of Disney as a kid, so I did not remember much of it. As I was watching it lately, I sat there thinking, "This is the strange thing I've seen." The 'Travel' scene looks like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly unusual color / voice versions of Jungle Books and Robin Hood characters. There are some not-so-Disney things I have noticed: children were threatened at knife points and prostitutes (during the song at Portobello Road). It was very fun, though the music numbers were long and I could see little kids getting bored with them. Also, the topic was somewhat black, see how it was set during WW2.
