The great Vincent Price has made many fantastic horror films, some of which range from the greatest genre genre of all-time. The greatest achievement of the cost was its film films in the 60s, and films such as Roger Corman 's brilliant sounds (always the biggest hurricanes of all time), Michael Reeves' Witchfinder General "(1968) or Ubaldo Ragona in" Last The Man of Earth "(1964) marks the latest point in this brilliant man's career. The films that made the famous man and thereby make him the iconic horror icon it is, however dating back to the 50s, and "House of Wax" (1953) clustered it into limbs. The "mad madman" in 1954 followed a plot that is very similar to that of its successor predecessor. This is not to say, however, that this movie is not an original, jokingly grim and absolutely beautiful gem itself. As the above lines can be suggested, Vincent Price is my favorite actor and, while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man was in, none of my fellow fans in this man could miss this gem little. <br /> Star Star as Don Galico (aka Galico Gran), an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices, whose boss, a slave businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from her. When the boss takes one of Galiko's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival, the Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico cut, and a murderous spree start to start ... < Do not you like Vincent Price when it came out for revenge? Some of her most famous and famous films such as Dr. Phibes's "Dr. Dr Phibes" (1971) or "The Blood Theater" (1973) were about absolute and cheerful killings, and the earliest movie Her horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does. This film provides a wonderful unique leadership role for Cost, who, as always, delivers a brilliant performance, and guarantees 70 minutes of fun exotic fun and fun fun for every horror fan. Another must-see for my fellow friend's likes.
