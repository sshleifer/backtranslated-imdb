Yes it can jump and can not seem funny as much as budget budgets out there, but this movie is really hilarious if you really look it. Tim Meadows has always hit me as being funny off at the Saturday night show. Each time he would make this character on the show I would crack up laughing. So, after I saw this was going to play on Central Comedy a night I decided to check it out. All in all, I was richly impressed with this movie, because it was not meant to win any Oscars or comedy of the year, but she had to entertain the Live Live fans who love the Ladies Man character. This film is also loaded with very quotable lines that can be recited for years to come.
