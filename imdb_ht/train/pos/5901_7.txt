It's a rehash in many recent films only this one has less stars, more complicated and a more soft feel in it. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own wedding (unbeknowst) starts its process of being arranged. In no time, the aliens are married and sent to a bee camp where they meet other couples going to the same motion as theirs. As they spend time together, the secrets reveal, broken hearts and / or mended and love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Private Honey Limits and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you've seen this movie. Twists are drawn to the same, no single element of surprise at all two and a half hours in the movie. Everything is predictable. I only loved it because I saw 'Darling' (also starting to lead to Deol & Khan) earlier in the day and enjoying their chemistry at that so I said "why not" when my sister suggested we rented ' Just marry 'too. <br /> <br /> See it: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and is himself usual to cherish him in it. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've had enough of all this nonsense story! <br /> <br /> C +
