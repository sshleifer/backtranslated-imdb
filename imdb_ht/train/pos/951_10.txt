I know that many people have a special fondue for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is one of beats. My wife and I own a copy of this movie on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very ghostly creepy story. Scott - typecast as Scrooge - is shudderingly mean and embarrassing, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving. I think it's up with its performance in Patton. Their spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal shape of the spirit of Christmas but coming send shivers down my spine each year. And what a support throw! David Warner, in particular, is in the head shape as Bob Cratchit, as Susannah York as his wife. <br /> I seem to remember that this version of the bat is closer to the original story than most others - but I can make mistakes, as it has been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a classic Christmas terrific.
