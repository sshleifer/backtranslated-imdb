This is one of the most popular movies of autonomous French in the seventies, starting with GÃ©rard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in a very sarcastic role. It is also one of many dramatic black dramas in the seventies / eighties, such as "Noire series", "Buffet cold", "Beau Pere", all realized by Blier. <br /> However, I would like to correct the previous comment posted on the movie: The title translated into English very far from the French version. It is true that both the protagonists will "place", but the French title might literally translate by the "waltz dancers", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testes.
