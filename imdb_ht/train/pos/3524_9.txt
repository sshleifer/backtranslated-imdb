For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when I was not yet a jazz junk. There is an exhibition until the end of June in Paris's new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY brand, named LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, not to miss, and as a special NINE special entertainment in jazz movies, including popular PHUNOM Lady DRUM series a. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr. - in almost every movie appearance, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr. was dubbed in the movie. This has been some progress, since most of the other appearances have been killed (especially in Howard Hawks's big SLEEP). 2. Krupa probably ami Cook in PL. I could recognize her style, since she had already graduated from Tom-tom's use (and abuse) at the start of her career - namely in the SIX SIX SIX, 1923 SING, SING, SING - and eventually got all that was possible in what we call in French "la caisse claire". 3. Sequences from PL, at least as shown in the Museum, are not censored.harry carasso, Paris, France
