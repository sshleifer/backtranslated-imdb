This movie has captured my heart since the very beginning, when Quincy Jones' first note heard or seen the wonderful color of the purple flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie to cry and die for ...! The entire cast gives the best performance of a movie I've seen in years and Spielberg has really outdone itself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh lord!), Danny Glover, and others, all give us the best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, gives him insecurity and feels the inferiority necessary for the character, and we grow up with him, we grow strong with him, throughout the film, and triumph with him. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she's the most arrogant, and shows us that "fisherman", indeed, "there's also soul". German sympathetic, good Danny Glover does a wonderful job of making people hate her and the magnificent music of (I'd say to him) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid movie! The photography, the music, the director and the music make this beautiful, sentimental movie of an experience in life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
