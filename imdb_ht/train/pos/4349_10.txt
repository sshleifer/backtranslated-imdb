Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) came to his son's place unexpectedly. The son Ben Benman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised to hear that his mother Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) left her father. The wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters tried to get Muriel while Ben and his father went to see a farmhouse in sale. But that's not the end of the trip. The road trip came in a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of the thing about my folks (2005) .Pol Reiser is behind the scenario and he does a remarkable job. Dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing. When he worked with the script for twenty years so do not be surprised at this good .Who would be better to play dad than Peter Falk? No one, I can tell you .And I really love the story about why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the party.Peter was an actor who made his father laugh .And Peter certainly made me laugh in the movie this is just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy defeated the youngest in the game of pool and then beat him with the stick.The femel is often very funny to me I find myself laughing several times. But it can also be touched from time to time. You could not tell a story any better than what it says here.
