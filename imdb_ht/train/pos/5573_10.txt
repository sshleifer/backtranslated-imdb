You must see! I saw WHIPPED in a press screening and it was hilarious. We're talking about laughing. He does everything about Mary looks like a drama. Amanda Peet screams quality stars and combinations have it's beauty, brain, and serious ability to act. Peter Cohen, the director, made a cutting edge film that shows raw inside of the male ego in the urban world dating. For all of it's comedy, its success team and its intelligence. Which is so rare for the first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. It's an important talent. Judge Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zorie Barber round out the cast with depth and depth depths as would be the male slick lady. You've got to see these guys going to work and get caught up in the Peet Internet. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth 3 minutes to download.
