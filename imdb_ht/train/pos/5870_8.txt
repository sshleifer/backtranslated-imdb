JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play 'Strange Snow' (the sync also written by Metcalfe), sensibly directed by David Hugh Jones, who explores the effect too often forgotten in the fight against permanent veterans damaged by the heavily ill Christians . It's especially intense to return to this 1989 movie as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the treatment before they receive our Veterans Hospital. Three friends went to the Vietnam War along with only two alive: The problem is that while both people suffer from one of David '' Flightigan High School '' Ed Harris so seriously damaged in posttraumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with his very close sister Martha (Kathy Baker). As David deteriorated to his friend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returning to the city in an attempt to help his friends. In the event Jacknife event offered first Marta warrant and eventually the two - in a Marta Prom must go through - and in that ball bom David completely fell apart, destroying relics at school and the turmoil of the townspeople and the students. Jacknife makes Dave revive this moment in Vietnam by losing friends and doing so bringing David to the point where he can start riding toward the recovery. And Martha suffers from finding her needs by trend of Jacknife, too. <br /> All three actors give amazingly fine performance: Ed Harris offers one of the most accomplished roles while De Niro and Baker hold the high standards set by their careers. More people should help to resurrect this all but to forget film as it is a fragile reminder of the war damage we bring to the guys who fight with them and the families who receive them after the end of battle. Very recommended. Grady Harp
