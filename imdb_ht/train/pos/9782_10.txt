Peaches is really a wonderful movie. I write this to refute a review from someone called 'Auscrit', which appeared on this site. First of all the idea that either the Monahans first movie 'interview' is somehow television is an extraordinary statement. Here is a movie that has been significantly praised around the world as it is simply one of the best Australian films ever to do. It's completely worthwhile to win better photos. Peaches is a brave, bold, and courageous departure. For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice. Monahan is a cinema that demonstrates great incredible skill and sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is not good simply by 'finding' the movie. Or more particularly does not want to get it. Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from inside the industry either distributes, exhibits or bureaucrats. Your average punters, I find just do not write comments like that. I noticed other comments on the site with references to Sommersault's film. One has to ask what people think they are looking for. Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS has released the push was, if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you by the movie. This manipulation of the media is very common down. The fact is the only similarity between the two films is that they are right in passage films. Unfortunately to me SS is a movie about nothing, which could be said in 15 minutes. I see it as a movie about anxiety. Peach in comparison is a piece of master. Personally I can not wait to see what Monahan does next as it is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to movies. In conclusion, if the film does not win all this year's AFI and IF awards, then it's a rugged game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive to do with your time
