I picked up reading the comments before that movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see him in a theater, and I'm glad I did because visually it was a striking film. Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s (except for the shrinking office, which was dating in a different way), and if you let nephew Campbell sequentially out, the whole movie has a wash out of early 60s ambiance. And the use of the movie's restaurant was fascinating. For a first-time director with background, I believe, is in writing, he has a big eye. In the first ten minutes I felt the plot missed plausibility, so I just want to stop my disbelief and go along for the ride. In terms of acting and the casting of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationship, the film was spot-on. William H. Macy, a fun to look, seems to have completed the void left by Tony Perkins late, if this and Magnolia are any clues. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was well moved, to me. It was a three-dimensional illustration of a character too often seen by two-dimensional society. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to her collection of unforgettable paints. Parents 'presentation (Bain / Sutherland) recalled me, in an indirect way, at the BUFFALO' Vincent Gallo, although tone-down quite a bit! I would definitely pay the money to see a second film of this director. She has self discipline in a 50's B-crime movie director (something P.T.Anderson will never have!), But she has a visual style and a way to actor who cares attention.
