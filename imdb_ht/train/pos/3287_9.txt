My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" from a hump of cinemas on our weekly breakout in the horror section - neither of us have heard of it, but the explosion on the box was really promising. And the movie did not disappoint, though I still probably would not call it a horror movie only. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a house, and visits her to her dreams. He is definitely sleeping when he sees the house, but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of event later, does not seem like a far cry from the truth. Anyhow, it finds it can be added to the home, its contents and its settings are not simply added to the picture. <br /> <br /> While this will be over, Anna is becoming increasingly more sick with a fever, and besides getting totally obsessed with the house and drawing it. On top of that, he and his mother also faced with his absent father; He has a job that takes him away for long stretches, even if one gets the impression there is actually more in the story than that. <br /> OK, so the drawing thing sounds nice enough - but frankly there's something really ominous about it. Dreamworld is the surrealist - home, for example, just a gray block in the middle of a desert garden. How to make the movie did a great job to make us very comfortable with this other world / dreams ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house is a little bit Men, Mark, who seems to be the same patient's physician to keep talking about (I do not give it away, you know at the moment it looks like it's the same kid). In fact, Mark can not walk due to a disease; In Anna's cartoon world, she can not walk because she did not make her any foot. He blames himself for his real life illness and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything begins to become really weird. She even carries her absent father in the cartoon, with the result of disaster. The bits and dad is really terrifying. <br /> I do not want to give anything away, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot to go to this movie. I'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing to make your death and pains after you look it - Is it a simple story like it looks, or who actually is the meaning layer? I do not know, but either it is quite fascinating. There was a "Nightmare on Elm Street" -the quality of it, in which at a certain point of reality and crossword dreams. I love things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it might have ended many times, but not. I'm satisfied with finishing it (some of your sensitive types might want to have Kleenex handy!), Even though it really could have a variety of conclusions. Anyway, it does not exactly feel drawn once it's actually over, but while you watch and keep manic back in, it's a bit nervous wracking. Still, "Paperhouse" is a really good movie. It's well done, and acting - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna - is toothache. Burke, who never before or since appeared in a movie, is a real gem. I do not know why he never goes on doing anything else, but either his way is really compelling and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's sort of a fantasy / suspension / something other kind of movie, and some definite horror moments - but you can always watch it with your family and you Do not be worried that your baby or grandmother will get grossed out of blood splash or something. /> Give it a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book, too ...
