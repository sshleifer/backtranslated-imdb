8 Simple rules for my teenage daughter's date had a good start. The very talented Tom Shadyac was involved in the project. This means that the comedy might have nothing less spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: The show remains one of the coolest, unusual, wittiest shows made in a very long time. Each line, facial expressions, casting choices, scenes, all wreaked in perfection. There was not one episode after I thought, "Man was not as good as the rest". Each person was an exceptional. Again, this is the kind of perfection that we have expected in Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first movie), the Nutty teacher (first one) and lying. Quite a summary. He is a producer here by a director, but is touching magic he felt in every episode.The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): cute, slightly neurotic , can be a pushover from time to time, works as a sports writer. As unfortunately passed away in 2003 left a memorable fan and pre-assured control cancellation by the costumes. Mom: Cate (Katey Sagal): Come on, who did not fall in love with Katey when she played Peg on couples with kids? Al Bundy was our hero. Our viewers gave him the respect and love he never had. But without Peg's peace, parasite, lifestyle, Al would have been probably another Chicago father instead of the mess that Peg (life, actually) caused him to be. Katey was a milf back then and still is: a brown now (instead of a wheel) and just as bukom as ever. Cate is the conservative mother and love wife. I know it sounds boring, but comedy, it fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Daughter Double Blond: Bridget (played in perfection by Kaley Cuoco): almost never has someone idiot played so well. Aside from Gob about development arrested, Bridget may well have a shoe-for any award given to this archetype. Bridget is deep, self-centered, not very bright and a tight slutty in his look. She plays the dumb blonde bowl better than absolutely anyone IMO. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> The girl Geeky neglected: Kerry (Amy Davidson): a brunette with a geek, she has no love out of life or circumstances. Feeling negligible, under-appreciated and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (in fact she is older than her) and the personality is very opposing to brain causing endless clashes, in many of our entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! -The problem-maker that he used was: that was to go through David Spade's character. <br /> <br /> Those characters were the main ones at the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, Larry Miller's insanely hilarious (one of my favorites) did not get much screen time. He plays co-worker / competitor Paul. After a prime breakthrough of his life's life expectancy in 2003 (September 11), the show was over for a while. No one thinks he could return, but he did later on, and a couple of new additions. This began the second phase of the show, with the new characters being: <br /> <br /> Strike, trust the principal: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on show talk. It was the first time that I saw him doing nothing. Impress, the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Her sadness was not brought in sooner. He also plays Cate's love interests after Paul passed. The gradual progress towards this point (which would have blown crazy at the start) to earn the many creators of praise. He did slowly, carefully and with great respect, with respect to the constant pay of Paul (Ritter). Father Attitude: Jim Egan (James Garner): An amazing welcome to the series, it was cannon fraud for old 'old' jokes, especially by ... 35-year-old old-wise- Bravo half-brother of the mother: CJ (played funny comic heights by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just did not know it was so funny. Somehow, the very familiar presence of the Spade feels inside his character (as opposed to a separate character), which is understood, since it is a funny and it's about a comedy show. This strange feeling is a bit like seeing a lot of people from material from David Spade's appearances in movies, show shows and functions (premium shows, etc.) and delivering a superb home in Spade's voice and comedy style, except that it they are spade. Not that I mean you realize it's not trying to play another person, or a whole new character: it's been the jump, funny spade we've come to know, and it takes this fun comic formula to the sheer head. Every line he spoke, all sarcasm he started, all classic, literally. Spade was crazy-funny; So the comic. <br /> Humor show and drama were both up after the show turned, but hearing was thought, "John passed, he will not be the same again." This is understandable, considering we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who gave 'Yes Dear' a free ride but that caused Andy Richter to control the universe to be canceled in no time. As the show's quality increases, its evaluation has been denied. Soon it was no longer, sadly. <br /> And I saved the best for the latest: The fan of the bride and the children in for a treat. And boy, what a treat he was. I'm still awkward just remember it. It's a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even though I'm legitimately done it under the "Beeker ..." apologizing. Suffice it to say it's something you will NEVER forget. I know I will not :-)
