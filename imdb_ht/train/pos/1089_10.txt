This film was made in 1948, but it still rings today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family wanting to buy a small place in the country and it "build" out there. Anyone who has ever built a home, will find this movie extremely endearing. Great throw. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made at the price of these things, and the comparisons of today's expenses are very amazing. I can not imagine anyone who does not enjoy this movie completely. I'm surprised by the average number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.
