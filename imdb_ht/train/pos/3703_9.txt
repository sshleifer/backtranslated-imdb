Ok, so it's an adult film. But it really is very nicely done. It is obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money to make a stylish sort of movie. I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. Even the act was fairly decent. The draw was more solid than most adult films I saw. The camera's work was higher than average. That's just a good flick!
