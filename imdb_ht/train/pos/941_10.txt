I saw this first version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I'm currently anticipating seeing the movie when it's released and it's more than live up to my expectations. I have now purchased the DVD and plans to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a nice life" I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas films ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a superb cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again that he is one of the most actor actors in our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acts ability to play any role and keep the character unique in itself. How can one be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? Scott does so easy. The direction is wonderful and fine costumes, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling at the time, location and era shows. You will simply love this movie and will put it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
