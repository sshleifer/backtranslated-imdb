Well, what can I say, this movie really happened to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really love it, although the idea seems simple, and rather boring, it's not. First of all I enjoyed the band (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. The second story is simple, and the spirit drama gets your attention. One thing I love most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with other horses, making the film more realistic, not a lot of animations seem realistic right now, but ... i do not That's right, to talk about is just so ... lame. <br /> One of the most beautiful animations in 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it's very relaxing.
