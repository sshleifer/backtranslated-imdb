Great, complete and passionate summary of American cinemas as seen in the eyes of Martin Scorsese. Needless to say, never had a dull moment in all 4 hours it runs time. Many genres, periods and directors are all examined, discussing more from the cinephile perspective than contemporary directors. For anyone even remotely interested in American films, or movies in general. A masterpiece, with the best of the BFI century in Cinema series. <br /> <br />
