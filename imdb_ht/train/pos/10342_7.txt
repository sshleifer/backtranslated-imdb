Melvyn Douglas once more provided a polished performance in which, at that time, she occupies the role of a detective who can not put love before the advent of Joan Blondell (which, far from being illustrated, as a suggested review, wrote a novel about her early life) is as enjoyable as ever his love suffering. It's almost a vicious comedy, almost a movie Man-type movie, almost a series, i Guess, which did not quite make it to an end. It does not quite happen to classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minute fun with a script episode but script, character character character, and the direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you almost do not notice that Williams ( Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting. I hope there were more movies like this.
