A great and terrific movie slowing camera-work adds to the dramatic make this a treat to look and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma performs a super Hitchcock-imitation (many call it a "ripoff") and this movie with the DVD 2.35: 1 DVD is a must fully appreciate the camera-work (with several scenes and hidden ones each side that is lost on tape-to-TV tapes). <br /> <br /> The downside of the film, at least to anyone who has some kind of moral standards, is the general toughness of all the characters, including policemen playing by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking and a long dark shower show at Angie Dickinson who is clearly even 25 years after his release. The film has several erotic scenes in her as Dickinson (if that's really read on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies. <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent that the assassin is, it's still pretty good suspicion and pleasure to look all the way off, particularly for men shaking the naked women.
