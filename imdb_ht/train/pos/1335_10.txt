After a love story triangle in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega these 3 stars were again chosen by this controversial flick. The film would be considered to hit if there was no conflict with the production value of Bharat Shah. Here Abbas-Mustan duo director has done a very different and unique work as compared to previous and subsequent businesses. They are considered actors in Bollywood. But this CCCC has proven that they can be equally busy making a romantic family drama. Usually there is a single action scene when Preity was being raped by Salman's colleague in his apartment, Salman slapped him. The movie has almost all the standards and ingredients such as songs, stories, casting, performance etc. which required a movie to hit. But of course, this Salman was something of a surprise gift from him. Why? Because for a long time it has been the role of a scene that shows the body open and the dance all around. His role as a wealthy young businessman with no-nonsense and normal attitude is really impressive. After all Madhubala, a prostitute role made by Preity is amazing. Later when she too turns out thinking about her life she deserves proper attention. Its facial expressions and body language become more attractive, and focus mainly on it. His role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not that heart-touched as she is here. Of course, this can be called as improvement. Then Priya, a very innocent and helpless wife of Raj who only depends on her for a better result. It does not have much importance in the story as the main ingredients are from Preity. Finally, the main point in the story is very rare and unique in itself. In real world at this age it is not entirely impossible to reach such a step to find a substitute mother. Perhaps, many are happening in this great world where they hold secrets. And in this way scriptwriter at CCCC has discovered a hidden truth that will take place in other daily lives. But still then is a doubt.
