Anne Brontes, THE WEDDING WALLS WILDFELL HALL, should be studied and read in all schools and libraries and people living in the halls. It's a fantastic story and says the "real" truth about alcoholism and lost marriage and a mother struggle to keep her son away from her brutal husband. It looks like stories today that we see and hear and I believe that people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on possible experiments true that the author was back in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Do watch this movie, read a great version of the book and very much move. I'm sure Anne herself would be happy with the way she was producing. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting with great location.
