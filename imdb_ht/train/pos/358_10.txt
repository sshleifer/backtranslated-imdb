The purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps these people strongly affect their struggles in life. Each character has a component of the purple in them. The movie touches on love, loss, hope, hatred, and triumph. If she had Celie lived in hell and lost her sister, and Shug came to her life to show her love again, Albert did not have her right man in the direction of Celie, Shug shunned by her father and confessed her to The end, Sofia and her stubborn good and bad, and even Nettie, had the loopholes and difficulties in the movie but were overcome at the end with this signing of a good movie. Good job at all the cast and crew.
