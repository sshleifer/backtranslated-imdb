Maybe Disney is hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different scene at the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly thrown and delivers a magical performance. There is something tasty dotty about her character and she is giving wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can bring a tune but it is certainly not much off as a singer. It does not matter he was like a gifted actor or hardly noticeable. Some camouflage comes from a lot of stars at another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and much love to the Tessie OSHEa who does very little but beautiful to see the old gal. It is also nice to see Sam Jaffe and the King of English TV Bruce Forsythe in the role. The note contains a couple of beautiful songs especially the briny sea and the age of not belief. The Portabello Road number is stretched to the limit, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects of watching a bit clich√© today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the heated army of films is very impressive. Children are not as annoying as other movies but one struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved singing in the Army home market. The home keeper was very important for Britain and this is a hot tribute. The animation is delightful, better than Pixar which I found grotesque. A hot movie happy with her an amazing she does not perform on stage.
