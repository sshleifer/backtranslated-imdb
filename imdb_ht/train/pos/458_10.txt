My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can not wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would like to know what the catchy song called and who wrote it, maybe because I am "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If anyone has complete lyrics, please send them. <br /> Of course a great reason why my wife and I loved so many series that we are 75 years old and retired, but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show indicating the contribution of society that can always be done by older people with special skills and experience. Aspects of human interest that show the interactions of the characters and the smaller ones around them are an important part of the show. This series is very fun and very sophisticated, on a par with some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
