I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I'm not sure if this can apply. In the last few years the movies have become filled with comedy movies that are way too stupid even to make you grin. Therefore, I consider the movies that do not meet these conditions as "serious comedies". 40 Years Ancient Virgin Fit Into This Guild? That's finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh much, plus it delivers a social comment to some really great characters and situations. <br /> I'm pretty much older than one 40 year old girl outside, and even those who do not exactly fit this specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially boys. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, is about Andy, a shy, silent guy, who collects face figures, survivors watch with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia . <br /> <br /> Here is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. She believes Andy must be a psychopath until Andy's secret reveals. Cal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet it seems to get what he wants and the opposite genre. David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who runs with another guy. And Jay, a man in a similar relationship must be affected by continuously copying him and getting hold of acts. <br /> I'm pretty sure that most teens from 13 to 21 have already watched this movie, but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. So in case you have not seen it and will enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, go to your video store and rest out of the deep and independent depressions films. <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
