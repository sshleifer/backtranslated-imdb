The film starts something like a less sensitive kinetics, more pasty dies or live: strange underground activities performed while the bodies were discovered by police officers. But when a police officer dies, one Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his Shihito brother also participates, things get pretty good. <br /> <br /> An earlier job in the Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of its usual use of ol 'ultraviolet and sadistic acts, even though it's not one of its more eclectic or flamboyant blanks. Instead, it's a little beautifully fabricated in fake pokers, as Tatsuhito digs his way to the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally taking body organs from Taiwan and holding a brothel almost to young boys (one particular character that killed the cop at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with the corporation, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use as violent and sadistic tactics to enter into this murderous domain. What's particularly interesting about this little at work is Tatsuhito's relationships with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back to Japan, and marginalized for her. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so killing his father and developing a crime zeal in Japan. Wang is also an amazing character Shakespearian, which is oddly enough as it is, much less than you actually start to feel sorry for him by the time of its ultimate confrontation with Tatsuhito coming to be. And Tatsuhito himself is a similar tragic figure when he was forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it's rude in the state that Miike's movies are successful mostly on the value of shock, it's true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, ten-round character. <br /> - -PolarisDiB
