The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. As he played a very bright and fragile character, he took his ability in the very corner and really worked the role. Her character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not half as interested in the party as Sandler has done me. For someone who plays primarily comedy role, he pulls on a serious role and it seems to be his own career and opinion. I especially liked the scene in which Adam and Don's characters gathered the motor scooter across the city. I am familiar with this moment, because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam had to get away from all of this. With his video game, music, and many other things he did to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter and his headphones over seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the look.
