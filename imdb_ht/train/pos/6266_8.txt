This picture for me notes very highly as it is a hugely fun and entertaining parody of alien invaders taken over a city and many of its men 'men. <br /> <br /> The city and players all covered out of the 1950s style and the whole movie has a minish delicate and kitschy feel it. Some of the scenes are hilarious as the birth of an alien creature. <br /> <br /> All actors provide full and severe performance that makes the movie even funnier with the special effects and aliens at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd to add to the entertainment. These types of films often deserve one such cult: 8/10.
