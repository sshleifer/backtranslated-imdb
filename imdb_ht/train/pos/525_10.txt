Just after the end of WWII, Powell & Pressburger urged to come up with something to try to heal the rift between the UK and the USA. At that time there was a lot of "surpure, about sexed and over here" kind of comment. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie ever. He got everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religions, dramas and many original. <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but it hit all the buttons right and although I've seen it hundreds hundreds (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points at all. <br /> <br /> Has it been the magnificent act, the wonderful device, the inspired script? What knows. But * make * look at it and you'll see what I mean.
