A prison cell.Four prisoners-Carrere, a young company director accused of fraud, 35-year-old transsexual in the process of his transformation, Daisy, a 20 year old mentally challenged savvy identity with Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. There's a stone slab of the cell, Mysteriously pulling loose, to discover a book: the newspaper of an ancient prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The newspaper has magic formulas that supposedly allow prisoners to escape. "Malefic" is one of the most creepyest and most cleverest movie I've seen this year. The film has a weather, incredible feeling influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, making for a very creepy and uncertain atmosphere. a fair amount of Gore involving some imaginative and brutal and dramatic death scenes of the four amazingly-well-captive captives. It's a shame that Eric Valette was remarkably horrific at "One Called Call" after his first stunning .9 out of 10.
