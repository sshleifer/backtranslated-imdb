This movie is a great fun. I recommend you look it yourself and then watch it again with your friends. I made last night and was fascinating how Norma Khouri could pull everyone in her world! I felt a little weird watching my friends go to the roller coaster as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie is talking about the movie! I saw a man standing almost up to Norma Khouri at level, but there is no place near the same size ring. It deceives at very gullible and rich people in the old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone trusts others. It would "sponsor" only those who seemed very well done. Who knew he would be stolen in excess of 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in town for only 1 month. Its victims were very fragile as they were in the first months or weeks of mild. He was wrong with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The highest crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did in his old neighbors. But I do not want to give anything away. <br /> I just found this one night on a late night movie channel, "Showtim" I think. This is still a fan of bigger experiences to be totally mislead in seeing something and having your head blown. Just drag your friends to see this and do not tell them something. It's a very fun movie, it moves quickly and never burns you. This would be an international classic forever. I believe that all big movies eventually climb to the top. Time will be very good movie. I'm just sorry that no one has ever heard of it, in some ways that the surprises are even better. The principal and editors were fantastic. They deserve the best documentary. <br /> JUST WATCH THIS FILM!
