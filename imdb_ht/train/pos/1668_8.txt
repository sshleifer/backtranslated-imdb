Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I would like it, but seeing I did not feel asleep again and nothing else was over, I continued to look and felt myself intrigued by the young Artimisia, a young female, pure and passionate. His novels and the older Tassi were reciting feelings of recognition. Though the film is based on a very romantized level and not reality, I liked it a lot more than the usual biographies or drama drama. Great play, great camerashots, great music and text. I liked it and I want more of it! :-)
