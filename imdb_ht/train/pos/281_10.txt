This game was really great and quite a challenge. It has a great, spooky storyline and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very attractive from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would like more weapons but that's just me. <br /> A really great game for RPG fans and Shoot'em'up.
