This animated film is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation, and storyline where all remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw her again for a second and we got more insight from her. We invite a couple friends to see Spirit with us and they really loved it very much. When I asked them to come together to see him, they thought it was a movie about horses, but after they realized it was much more than that. I love Esperanza, Spirit, Rain, and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who smiles a Lot in dance with wolves. The spirit has symbolic profound meaning and metaphor that I have found to be abilities and inspiration. <br /> I saw Spirit for the third time and I want to go see it again. I enjoyed many "minds" because American Americans are realistic, dignified, and non-stereotypes unlike the movie "Road to El Dorado", which was a total wholly because it described Indian Americans in a respectful and stereotype. But Dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making the mind a great movie that I get to be acceptable! I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit, and I would like to see the spirit of spitoffs or spinoffs if they respect and without stereotiping the American Indians. <br /> I highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay for seeing the Ghost: Stallion in the Cimarron.
