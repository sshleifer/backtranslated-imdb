This film was filmed at the Rotterdam IFF. You can ask some decisions in the marker - such as choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and awful topic - but this movie sure hits you in the gut. Especially the recent scenes were almost painful to look. Hope it becomes the distribution it deserves.
