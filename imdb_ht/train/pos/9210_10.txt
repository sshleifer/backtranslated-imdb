I feel this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older and more western man. I like movies based on at least part of reality, if I do not make this mistake as a movie. I also love movies of revenge, This qualifies as well in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and scene of shooting galata. I felt the scene of choosing Choir was a little overkill but did not affect how I feel about the movie full. I saw what I think is a continuation of this film in a fire fighting episode. I also liked it. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie and watch it again. I also felt that the romance parts of this movie were well played. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play a bad guy, but I still enjoy his acting.
