Now, for all the cinematic enthusiasts out there, this movie can not rank high on your list of the things they see. But if you know anything about the scheme development, the profound truth, and the intentions that this film (the series) has been, you would understand my pals <br /> <br /> Granted, the specifics of the movie are rendering to the writer, who can not hope to know what will happen to the end. But the film is accurate and justified "viewers" library of viewers about what can be. I am a Christian, not due to this movie, but because of my personal decision accepting Jesus as my Savior. The film and potential that something similar to the circumstances described here can considerably scare someone into thinking about the actions and decisions. It's not a few cheap attempts to scare people into believing in God, but rather, a means to get your attention. As a Christian, I know I will not stay behind, thanks to movies like this, I can look beyond the superficiality of entertainment, acting, and budgetary film to appreciate the movie's depth offers. This is a movie you should not only see, but feel with your heart and soul.
