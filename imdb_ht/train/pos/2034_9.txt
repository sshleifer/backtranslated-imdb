I've never been great about IMAX movie. They're cool, but once you get on that initial rush in "Whoa, it feels like flying!" The movies themselves are usually very coral and ordinary. The exception was the powerful "Everest", exhilarating "Wild California" and now the BBC "The Human Body", a super-size look at the bowels of our body. <br /> <br /> Our body is the machine of a complexity that is simply unbelievable. This film 50 minutes might be 10 hours long, and it still does not get through all the systems working in tandem as I typed this review and listened to my radio, and most of us took it all to be granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a heart pumping (looks like a foreign vessel), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum that sounds process, the development of a baby inside a mother In my matrix, and amazing, a few ... um, less attractive functions that I thought it would be shy away from (button, churning through acid in the stomach ...) <br /> This film also has a rather style funki read, which sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've seen all sperm finding its way into the egg, but you've never seen it put in tune in Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On"? It's a creative moment like what the "human body" is not just a healthy but fun lesson.
