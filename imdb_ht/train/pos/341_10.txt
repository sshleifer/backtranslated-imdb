I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. The cast was excellent, the plot was thrilling and fun, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! I would rate this as one of the best stairs I've ever seen! The girls in it were really nice too, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornery in the movie and gave her some OOMPH characters!
