Old old movie will know why I would call this one "The Man of the Gray Flannel Robe." Most of the Bible-based movies are basically klock- what might be called smiling and giggles here is how Peck, trying to raise awareness of a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying all neanderthals on it. As a great romance, it fell flat as unleavened bread. But there is something entertaining about this movie. In all the major Hollywood Bible pictures it is most striking to convey the ambivalent mood of the American average towards the belief in the biblical God. Land Billy's Sunday is duking it out with H.L. antithesis. Mencken's all in the script. Who gets better in it in the Chorus synthesis that is supported depends on your point of view. Other than that, D & B has many good performances by Peck (especially at the scene of repentance) and by Jayne Meadows as his first wife Michol, lively, moody atmosphere (good idea to put most action at dawn or night), and proclaim vibrant twenty-thirds Psalm at the end.
