As a guy in bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this one. The plot is not really bad, but there are a few situations where you really need to ask yourself "what the heck will be over here?" There are so many things that make this movie the bad movie ever. The first, Rudy Ray Moore has gotten so fat and gently that film was filmed that the special effects are composed of speeding up the stage in the double-fight battle. There are also scenes where there is an instant-motion recurrence, jumping over a ten-foot wall (by playing the fall of it back), naked people walking out of big letters, and gender that literally brings down the roof (and keeps up the back the house is caught on fire). Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie should complete without a completely free and random comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun of all the customers, interprets and makes some odd dances. There are many bad things about this movie, but they're bad in a fun way, and if you take your eyes off the movie, you may miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for current value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for picking errors and goofs, average from 7/10.
