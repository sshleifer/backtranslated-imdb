The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. It does not present a series of beautiful pictures. Instead it is a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to work constantly or maybe imagine the context of the various shots. This sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed in. The movie refuses to use the frog in a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer to find out what's going on. Instead the movie touches and moves in a number of different styles. The movie's liking trick is being able to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect 99% of North American viewers will just not get it. If you try the narrative bug in this movie, or the philosophical message, or the symbolic structure, etc. you will waste your time. There are none of these. The movie only feints in the direction of those genres and others at times. Only unified forces in the movie are Claire Denis's own sense of what suits them together. Some feature feature films that come close to satisfy the cant's description of what the art, namely the pleasure of the judgment itself rather than simply plentiful experience under concept. Movies usually take the easy way out and opts for the simplest fun to understand what's going on. Most films are not art. Most films do not come near art. When a movie does, like this one does, and is always enjoyable by a great view of the spectator, it's something of a miracle. I'm on negative comments is that at times I get the movie too simply to buy through the various narrative threads that run into it. Tahiti Father-son, though it's not exactly conventional, ends up doing things a little clear and simple. It dominates too much.
