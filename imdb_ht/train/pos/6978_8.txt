Well I must say that I was waiting for it to come. <br /> I will not try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly talked about the pilot. On the other hand I'm not quite certain to understand the opponents claiming themselves to be BSG fans and not like the pilot. <br /> What is the frustration expected? !! The Foundation will place 50 years before our BSG has helped in Cylons' birth, seeing Adam's family life (we already know some of it from BSG), finding a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and its perceptions in other colonies and potentially the origins of God are the belief in the human and the beliefs of God of God in the Cylons. I do not expect even profits of special effects or opera space like in the previous series, I make the difference between the two although I know that Caprica will boost BSG. <br /> <br /> This is the promising start 1h30, I believe as well that this will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I hope so much of these things but I have no doubt that we will learn a lot more. <br /> <br /> Look at the scene of the DVD also provide more material for your brain to grind. <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
