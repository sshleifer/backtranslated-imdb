Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors of Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Already a success of performing American sophisticated dramatic as a letter to three wives and all about Eve as well as successfully adhering to Shakespeare's life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz performed a nice job in bringing this hit Broadway movie plays and doing it with style . Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, though she can not sing too well. He is the only actor who can pull it in perfectly understanding his absolute calm and clear. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sara Brown and her scene with Brando sizzle and great chemistry. All actors are supporting parties, especially Sheldon Leonard as the Harry Horse in a very funny way. Still, Mankiewicz should give most of the credit for bringing a fine music into his own right of the screen in such a way that he feels native to many scenes but is still a story in his own world. All in all, guys and dolls are a great music and work on many levels it normally should not have.
