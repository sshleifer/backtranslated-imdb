Cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a new refreshing set of eye to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a great way. This movie is smart, short, and always fun and funny. As a writer / director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters both absurd and lovable. The story is definitely something you have not seen before that is a good thing. It's unique and fun, and manages to work visually fantastic as well as having the long slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy. <br /> A very promising first movie.
