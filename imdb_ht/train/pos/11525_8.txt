This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is beautiful aesthetics. I absolutely love that. There is a dark color throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque set. A photography that looks very much (and probably did not) supplement the look. I still enjoy the stories about group misfits / loners come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but this does not. This group of actors really shows quite flawed but very characteristic characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the wind and the road movie theme, I could not help, but remember my favorite movie last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, very interesting actor, and just was annoyed a little bit by Til performance at times. The opening scenes, all the scenes where the chaos are tricks are very funny. There is a mixture of humor and emotions throughout the movie. I love the end very. And of course it is all about terms of magicians. A good magician will make the audience look where he wants them, to create an illusion. What happens to be exactly what a movie director does and is therefore called it magic movie.
