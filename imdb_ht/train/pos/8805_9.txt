A patchwork on 911. 11 stories from 11 directors in 11 countries sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (one first, for example), sometimes used to say "we had more death than you and you killed the thieves" , sometimes really strange (but very symbolic and interesting). I really like Claude Lelouch (personal live in a couple of New York, showing that our "day" issues are not important), Shoei Imamura (rare, strongly anti-war in general), and Idrisissa Ouedraogo (comic, typical Africans despite day-long affliction), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peaceful, whose moral difficulties accept the American policy towards Arab countries). I'm really happy to see that many Americans have loved this movie. It shows that we (or they are still Belgians, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures, and may ask for past and present actions in our government, as we should be in a democracy.
