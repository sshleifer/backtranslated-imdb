Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films are very, very little drawn. Instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! Movies such as HELP MATE and BOS BODY are among the funniest as you see the boys are working or cleaning their homes. Here's hard work, most of the movie is analogous to these other films - Stan and Ollie are sweeping the chimney and spending most of the movie trying (quite unsuccessful) to a fool's own fireplace. See Ollie falls in the fireplace, the boys make the house a total mess and the crazy behaviors of Stanley all work together to make a very fun movie. <br /> However, in an odd twist, there is also a really strange subplot that starts and ends the movie. It seems that the teacher is really a mad scientist and is working on a formula for doing things younger. End of the movie, you see him make a duck in a duckling and even a duckling in an egg! Given that she then let the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? While this subplot was needed, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. Give the boys nothing interesting to do and you will be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the best films of the team and it almost earned a 9.
