From the first five episodes of short-run "Hammer House of Horror" series, this fifth episode and the wonderful title "The Bled House of Death" is arguably the one creepiest one. As a great fan of Gothic Gothic Hammer Studios movie fans for many years, I wonder what has taken me long to finally start watching the series lately. So far, I've seen only the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series remains as fun as the first five episodes, I'll be satisfied. Whereas the second and third episodes were great to look for the morbid senses and dark spirits in humor, this fifth entry is definitely the one from the first five who delivers the most genuine movie. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his master from unknown motivation. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) moved to the house with the little girl Sophie (Emma Ridley). Soon after the move, however, the family has to find out there is something terribly wrong with the house, which is seemingly haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is a lot better than his mediocre entry Before, "Growing Pain" (Episode 4), and the actors fairly gender deliver good performance. The film is also well-versed in terms of effects, cinematography and notes. "Bled to Death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer-fans would like to see in a Short Horror Story. The film delivers a creepy atmosphere, real-time scary and intense twists, and it is thrilling and very fun from the beginning to the end. In general, this is highly recommended Hammer fans.
