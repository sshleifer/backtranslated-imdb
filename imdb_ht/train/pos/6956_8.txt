I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. This movie was uber beautiful and I mean uber beautiful. It has all the "gender" content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something an extra island, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but credible chemistry that seem to surpass each stage. Both seem to create odd, braid, and exciting relationships with "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can not feel your face again. Anna Farris and the rest of the support team seem to play in the role of each other perfectly and even Wanda Sykes' rather small roles will keep you laughing. Even though these types of comedies are not for everyone, but I said I went with someone who does not usually enjoy those films and it was laughing like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since a few moments too ... well admitted to ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, the hard end I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * from 5 *)
