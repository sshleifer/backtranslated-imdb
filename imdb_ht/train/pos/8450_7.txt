Not really bad for the PPP's first PPV in 006. But the finish was really really shocking everyone in attendance and that was looking at the house. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITERATURE CHOOSE INTERCONTINENTAL WIK By a bad box, these two can seriously put on a great match if they have more time put on a lit. Flair wins by DQ after Edge Slams and his MITB backpack. 3/10 SECOND MEN STRATUS VS. MICKEY GAMES FOR WOMAN'S WOMAN'S CHANGES By bad noticing the fact that this is the first time the Divas faced in the ring together. Mickie goes for a chick chick to change, but Trish duck and nails his own chick chick for the win to keep his title. 3/10 THREE MATCH TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good match this was, really. All HHH's matches focus on wounding Big Show while Big Show is still fighting back. Pita HHH is able to release Big Show & Nail Pedigree for the win. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a match bonus} Not bad, it was OK. After Viscera came down, behind the referee, Benjamin's mother got a suitcase {which had brick in her} & was slamming Viscera on the top and read three times. Viscera up just get caught with a kick spinning heel by Benjamin to win in against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- JERRY 'WA' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS boring, slow & sloppy. Both men did not really put up a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a drop point for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH-TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A PRINCIPLE WHO HAVE THE FAMILY FAMILY It was very fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last to win First Match Gangle Women all the time. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR CHAMBER MATCH TO CHOOSE YOUR CHILDREN TO CHOOSE CHILDREN It was a cool room to eliminate match. But nothing will be top Elimination last year was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him. Six later Cena gets a roll-up roll over Carlito for three counties to win the room to eliminate & hold his WWV titles. But his night was not yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon came out and congratulated Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon stated that his night is not over yet, & says Edge Cash in his money at the Cena Challenge Banking opportunity for the title. Edge comes out with Lita, giving the Vince suit & top off of the ring as Cena has one more match going here tonight. ITEM / CHAPTER SELECTION OF THE WIK {Cena who is busted open while matching the bedroom} gets hit straight away by Edge, Edge then nails a spear on Cena, goes for the cover & his shock Cena break out. Edge nails another javelin & cover for the shocking three count as he defeated Cena & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So New Year's Revolution last year was better than this year, but it was still well. The EC match was also good and shocking at Edgeing Edge in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shocking about the PPV show. Overall: I'll give it 7/10 & C
