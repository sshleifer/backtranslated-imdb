This film was a fantastic comedy. He has a lot of comedy stars in it like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and Jan Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and that was all the air hostesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who love the Maggie girl (Neha Dupia). When John Abraram cheats on his work, he became Akshay Kumars and Akshay Kumar really become jealous because of his flatness to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starting to just John more. Akshay Kumar wants better than John Abraham to find a dish and he will come out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
