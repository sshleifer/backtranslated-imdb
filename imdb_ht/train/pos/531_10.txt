This movie has the most beautiful opening sequences ever performed. I saw this film for the first time a week ago, since then every day I saw the opening and every time I feel thrilled as I felt the first time I heard David Niven utter the immortal word from Sir Pilelerinaj Walter Raleigh: <br /> <br /> Give me my scalop-shell in quiet, my staff of faith to walk on, my scripts of joy, immortal diet, my bottle to deliver, my gown of all the beautiful power, true gage the hope; So I'll take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> You know why it would be a truism telling Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger's life to be quite justified to have crafted like a wonderful opening? Because they have already admitted to the paradise of Poets long before this film was made. <br /> I imagine both of them facing trial during Doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god: I ask your forgiveness, Master. So do you want to know what we do throughout our lives? Well, well you will see: We've written and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red shoes ?? Do you think that's enough? It is rather obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duties with God, the Nature Muse or whatever you can call It when they have shot a matter of life and death. The fact that the life of the other should be justified for their works might not be apparent to everyone, despite feeling my life would have a meaning I never did anything else to see this movie. <br /> Of course the old-timers will be tempted to say: They do not make movies like this one anymore. They will be partially mistaken; they did not make films like that in the past either. <br /> I've already quoted Keats here, but I'll repeat his words: Something of beauty is a happy forever.
