I remember this much more than Nausicaa at the bottom of the winds at an age when the tone of history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion in its Spanish audience, has the cartoonish knife at the first Conan production director. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan - who flew about a thousand stories to carry her girl in her arms and landed on her feet, then started running. This makes it the most animated and fun character to watch. The techie techie fans of Nausica can be disappointed by the flying bugs with the retro technology in out Laputa - the only exception can be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the term Laputa does not directly connect with the environment. If he has a whole theme of anti-war. The importance of living naturally - this is related to the flying castle, is dismissably briefly discussed, and does not really follow in. In general, I now consider the piece as being in an intersection between feel-good and blown.
