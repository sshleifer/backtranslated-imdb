This is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half critter types of people on an uncharted island, then calling all his old business and friendship friendship to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants sharkman to kill them! Many of the bad GCI, trace elements trace, and sweat sweats in tight t-shirts. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but that's one spicy fragrance and a bit of humor (I'm guaranteed as that which made this language firmly planted in a cheek), not to mention the sexy babes. But let's mention these little beards - several hot bees, tight t-shirts, sweat sweat. One of her undies at the start, another at the end. Thanks, thank you, musicians in bad movies! The plot is everything to jump, a guy drives up into a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone on the island of a helicopter. Yeah, um, well, how do you think about it for a while; we will get back to you. Sharkman is hilarious - either awful CGI or an equally funny guy in a rubber suit. The mad scientist provided a very good performance; It is wrong, this is his motivation, it does not make any excuses. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a stupid, FUN B-movie, this one should do the job.
