This is one of the best classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a very enjoyable Wallace crime movie movie film back from the 60ies: Despite his magic, Mr. Kinski, Missing You Still Have Young 'Joachim' Black Fuchsberger, starts once again as a typical smart womanizer, you have young Eddi Arendt at the best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British Butler - and you have (not so young again) Lowitz as melancholy yet very 'dry' ironic (and so: very fun) police investigator. In addition you will find a freakish and extremely 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie title!), You'll get a balanced soundtrack-out, classic b-movie action scene, partly filmed from Persecuted people (please remember when it was origin!), Crying rain, and over and over ... All these ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet little cocktail of pure Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended! !
