Meryl Streep is excellent in his nuances and stoic performance as Lindy Chamberlain's Lindy accused and tried to allegedly kill his own child Azaria Chamberlain and using his alibi defense defense as his defense. Based on the book "Angel Evil" and titled so in its Australian release, a CRY in the DARK is an ugly movie to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real to us in America: witch-hunt against someone judging an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. When someone thought his idea, someone who did not play the liking map, and someone who was just tough enough to move with his life despite his terrible hustle, was marked as suspicious and hate pi Far beyond understanding even when it was clear he did not kill his own child. The media started a tightening knife and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon all the nations stuck to their lying as they picked up this piece by piece. And in it all, Lindy remains as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael fell apart. <br /> <br /> This position, of course, is the power of force, as unsympathetic as it may seem, and people who react strongly to that. They want to see a mournful mother and cry and sometimes faint in every turn, do not sit there and look empty. People do not understand that not everyone is just like when someone decides to stop the speculators. Meryl Streep defines this woman attached to the pig and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one who is not convinced even if they listen to her freedom. Because of it, Sam Neill allows his character to slowly dissolve into despair - someone who, or Chamberlains should be too tear-off, and no one wants to see it. Except the monster that has at this time written become news-media. They will always eat debris train up and feed the movie mangled to the public uninformed.
