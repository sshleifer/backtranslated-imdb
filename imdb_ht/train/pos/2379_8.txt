H.G. The Wells Classic had several incarnations. 05 'Speilburg version with the classic version 53' But only this one remains completely true in the book. Nothing has changed anything to remove. <br /> <br /> Originally Released as a movie 3 hours. The director re-cuts the movie down to 2-hours of pure excellence. He has a chapter by visualization chapters on the novel pages that "Wells should be proud of" the story is as everyone remembers. The margins invaded the Earth and Capsules with an army in Tripod Market Machines for War. The 19th-century people are ill-prepared to repel the foreign forces and fight back with cannons and weapons that mesh shell tied right off the walkers, and when mankind is not a world wide power to save by the least of earth's organisms. The film is an excellent achievement for Timote Hines's great potential director as he has brought this vision to life with a financially budgeted 5 million dollars. Today B-Movies has the largest budget.
