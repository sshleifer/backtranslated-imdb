well done giving the prospect of fraulein doctor to capture both the cost and worthlessness of war. Excellent acting especially when high high commanders deny in the name of chivalry presents medals kaiser ordered hit. The scenes of carnage are probably too intense for American spirit effects that would probably favor some funny speeches with absolute abstract as the 14-point or league of nations. American realms might appreciate the story line with the action. For all the action and intrigue, fraulein doctors compare the fairy (u) rable to the guy Jacob.
