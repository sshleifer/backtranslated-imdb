My college professor tells Othello that Shakespeare's biggest drama can be. I do not know if I agree with it again. I bought this video version of the movie. First I like Kenneth BRANagh as Iago, it was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Unreasonably, he did not direct it, but he played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. not having a British vs American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses that he richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is faced with the problem of race. Something that has existed in the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could be best and show the complicated union union. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, it is weak for jealousy and fear of losing it to a non-Curiosity like Cassio. It's quite a big scene at the end of the movie but I will not reveal the finish. It's just worth watching. I think they are edited lots of lines in 2 hours but they still edit Shakespeare.
