I'm fond of ART, I love anything about Art, I love painting, sculpture, etc. This movie shows it, so I love it so much, how a woman wants to paint anything on Art, especially naked body, but not Can do it because of his family (father), at the beginning of the film he painted himself naked, but he wanted a man to paint it, but his family did not let his paintings look naked because of the moral account. Even so Artemisia can paint his boyfriend and his art teacher completely naked. She fell in love with her art professor, and she looks like the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too, so at the end she kills her freedom to not lie. He said he had raped him, but he was not true. Artemisie falls in love with her, but if she says he will suffer a lot, because of the trial of Artemisia, his father and art teacher, someone has hurt his artistic hand to tell the truth. I think this is a great movie about ART, and an artistic love, It's worth to look. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she acts very well, I also love her performance in the "portraiture of a lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
