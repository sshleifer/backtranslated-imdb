Life Pod is one of those movies that you just look and try not to analyze too hard. The act is rather amateur, at best. Special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer runs amoctic, but not exactly a computer and the running amoeba is very well understood when the truth is revealed. Always the movie has its moments and is quite watchful. For me, at least part of the attractiveness of this movie is the crucial role of Kristine DeBell. He may not be the greatest actress in the world, but he has an ancient playmate of the month, he is pretty good. Throughout life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies in the 1980s and somewhat predictable. The White Star line bit is beautiful, if completely correct. The latest of the White Star Company Company was bought by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship sailing under the White Star color was the Britannic (by the Sister of Titanic) sold for broth in 1960.
