IN Cold Roll is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it's also so low on being realistic, it's sometimes more clinical than fun. Reporting the brutal death of a Midwest family, author Truman Capote focuses on minutes, packaging himself and the reader up to the subject AND MATTER! Brooks exits wildly in this approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. Although its current film film, it keeps its distance. The murderers are present as bitter bitter, which are surely being. They do not see this as a soul misery (as in Capote's book) and violence in acts are horrifyingly weakened. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers are cast in support, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the character "character?") The landmark photography is not the great Conrad Hall.
