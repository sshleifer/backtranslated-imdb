This movie does a superb work of describing the behavior of a sore (Lou Gehrig of Sickness) suffering. It is the subject of iron and compassion as well as humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so convinced as someone with ALS that I found it difficult to believe he was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, a superb actor, lives up to expectations as the original artist is wrongly compelled and forced to give Helena Character Company as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Watching the development of relations between these two is a treaty from beginning to end. Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. One comes to care deeply for two of them.
