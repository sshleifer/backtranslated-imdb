There are many in our lives that we meet only once in our lives, but for some reason or another we are reminded of these people for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friends happen between people who are long distances and there are still some natural reasons why we do not meet those people anymore. We do not even know their names, as we never presented each other, and sometimes we even forget what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because meetings might spoil fond memories, or we do not know them. We're too scared to check that out. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' just keeps me watching it. I never intended to watch it in, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the movie. I did not know what to expect from it, but neither did the young couple. They had time to discuss each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they were separated. I believe that this movie has been well reviewed because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has at least once or twice live in. It makes us all think about all those we have encountered only once in our lives.
