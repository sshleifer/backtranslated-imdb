The Road Rovers were a great show on the doggy supers chosen by the Master of crime fighting around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that might appeal to all ages. Run jokes across the series that could spawn a game of drink. The action was fascinating, and cleverly set up. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show's most was the depth of the characters. Each of them has difficulty and emotional difficulty that is never expressed, but implicitly in subtext. Hopefully, one day, there will be some ways to watch the rovers in action again.
