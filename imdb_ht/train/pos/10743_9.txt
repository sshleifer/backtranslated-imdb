I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of story. Some people think that the narrative added is weak and <br /> I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. Approximately two brothers found each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger on Tony. But I do not think that narration is needed. As much of my theorist I think our own lives are nonsense. We live and do our own autobiography. So, if we say about our lives this is still in the form of narratives. We do not realize such facts as: Birth, Childhood, High School etc. We have created a story about our lives. Because we are familiar with history, we want to put stories into a story as well. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand the things that happened in history when it was said in the form of a story. So, this is the purpose of adding a history of documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If it were me out of here I could worry about my brothers. <br /> <br /> And the second point, make a blockbuster movie about it. True, he recently came up with a great movie about 9/11. Though, there were a few on the subject, but none of them were like this documentary. But what if there is a movie of about 5 years? I agree it is wrong to make a lot of money out of 9/11. But I agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell stories. How many movies about World War II have we seen? If I did not see those movies watching my WW I totally different. I remember seeing Schindlers List, and I called for an hour during the class. Movies give you a good idea of ​​what happened in history and although it is the fiction it contributes to memory of the disaster and the victims. <br /> So, my point: storytelling is not always bad, it makes us identify with the story, and makes us forget about what happened.
