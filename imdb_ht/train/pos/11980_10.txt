Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and also a good family show. There really are no shows like it yet. Children are very nice and even though it's a bit cheesy, it's always good, especially for anyone who looks at it when being a kid. I would like to see the cast now interviewed. Anyone who would like to see the interview in the cast, kind of a place to now the kind of thing for the special features of the DVD, should go to the Petition site site and sign a petition titled Full House Reunion DVD as there is a petition in hoping that the cast may want to do it. Yay for full house!
