If you are a fan of noir movie and think that they do not em up as they are used here, here is your answer - they just do not em in Hollywood anymore. We must go to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre case. My mouth is a nice little gift to the faithful from director Jacques Audiard, featuring sharp stories and fine performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic draw can be written in the 40's: mute but ancient apple and smart femme smart but dudy femme (which turns out to be ambitious pity) discovering each other while living the life Depressive weaknesses and eager to see, manipulate each other to meet their own, develop complex love / hate relationships, cook up criminal scheme involving heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. All actions take place in depressions, seduced and / or illuminated places. <br /> <br /> Odyad was fashionable some modern twists, of course. Femme's fatality is an underappreciated office worker who is almost deaf and uses the lip reader's ability to take revenge on those who are marginalized. And where you could expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Adding to a bit of modern technology and music and looks like a contemporary movie, but makes no mistake - this is the old movie film film. It's as good as any movie from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year long.
