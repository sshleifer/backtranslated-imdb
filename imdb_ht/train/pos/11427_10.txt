I loved this movie because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what I imagined life in African colonial Africa must have been like in the 50's ("my generation" anyway). But I was really hijacked by her quiet rhythm and did not finish the splendor. In the last five minutes of this film, you must focus on what's happening. Never was I more impressed with "wrap-up" in a movie. I remember calling "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters are falling asleep on the couch !!
