In this "dramatically acclaimed psychological promotion based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, gets fascinated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his foster mother (Toni Collette) Question raised on the boy (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn to an enlarged mystery that conceals a deadly secret ??

Finished, and Mrs. Collette planned her new life, should be cut off, and sent to "deleted scene" land. It's overkill. The true nature of its physical and mental illness should be evident, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. It is possible, blindness might be in question - but a revelation could be certain of either the "Highway" or "scene scene" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a cut "director"? Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) do not seem, initially, credible as a couple. A scene or two established relationships could help set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a "gay mockery". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Donna Collette belongs to the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, "you know, like that Guy comes from 'Psycho'." There were several years when cost acting organizations seemed to reach for women, due to a slower dispersal of roles; Certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some consideration. It is that good. And Patrick Stettner has definitely recalled Hitchcock - he even got a sandwich in a car suspender car. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve recognition from present flights everywhere .. <br /> ******* The night reader (1/21 / 06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
