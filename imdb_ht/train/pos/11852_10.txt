Spirit is a unique and original look of western life from the point of view of a wild horse, with native Americans. The film focuses on friends and dangers of a wild horse, Spirit, meeting during his life. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using today's available technology to deliver stunning visuals in depth and realism. The music is fantastic, and by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who also was responsible for the very popular music from the 1994 Disney hit, the Lion King. > <br /> The story is not too deep but the fact that it is not quite as inferior as some movies do not in my opinion opinion from the movie as a whole. <br /> excellent movie that I enjoyed so much, and that is suitable for the whole family. No one should miss. (10/10)
