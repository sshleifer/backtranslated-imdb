First and foremost, I saw the woman in black, I think only time in my knowledge she appeared on TV back in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my dad and I looked at her in the living room Shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was very young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more scared walking in church courts to enter the church that night me or my dad! There are many factors on this movie that make it so creepy but I think the 0ne are the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of almost every Hollywood movie, so every creak, Thump and Bang further amplify your mind as there's no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories does not have any scrutiny involved as something bouncing out the closet so it does not necessarily what you see, but what you hear and what you think will be over. This is a smart way as nothing is scary or more than self running riot thinking around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A superb ghost story, I have never seen anything that can match it and with the bush that repeats on and over on TV I cant believe the BBC has erased it after (in my knowledge) only one that shows!
