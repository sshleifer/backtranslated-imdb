Some movies you just know you will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Draws it back to the "Double Indemnity," and the "Still Ring Two Times" of the 40's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90 's. Nick Cage plays "Character Character" down to character The main thing that gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his chance goes from bad to worse even worse than he tries and tries to get away from people, cities, violence and threats at the Red Rock West. Much of twist and turn, great performance by cage, hopper and walsh, a hypnotic slip-guitar music music, and smoothly led to doing this a real joy. Favorite Line: When cages gathered in the empty gas caliber of the car get-away, shake it and say: "F *** in 'story in my life."
