This is one of the very few movies that are very erotic without pornographic, although there was only a very rudimentary plot. There are no live sounds or dialogues; Instead, actors make voice-overs describing their experiences, why they were involved, etc. <br /> is a document. <br /> <br /> It's mind-blowing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is already something like this. That. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: The producer may not distribute a DVD version. I've never seen it being sold anywhere; One can email Mr. Boerner and order a copy of VHS.
