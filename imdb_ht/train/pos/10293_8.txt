'Powerful Bruce' will sweep the Academy Awards with a 14 Oscar file wins! It will surpass 'Titanic' as the rude film ever of all time! Jim Carrey's Jim illustrations will be at a superior level that will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House Fossils. Almighty! These great imagination would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the power of God. That's the same is the essential ingredient of Carrey's laughing street 'Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so absolutely obsessed with being the main dye that he has kept God in total guilt for his own contretemps. God, the heaven is played by Morgan Freeman, Bruce 'Gift of God's gift (His power) in order to challenge Him if He can do God's work any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed 'away with its newfound blissfulness and uses selfishness. Carrey is back in his familiar funny comic book of 'Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston did not mis.pittiful as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not leaving the dog out of the house for # 2, and shows us the most hilarious bathroom scenes of all time! `The Powerful Bruce 'is not Carrey's most profound film, but it's still a similar kick show in' Carreyism '! **** Well
