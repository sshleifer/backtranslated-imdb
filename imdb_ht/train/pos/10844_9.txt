This reminds me of Spin Tap, on a more serious level. It's the story of a group to make a reunion tour, but things are not harmoniously between them. I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray. You felt sorry for her, but she had a certain crisis on her. It's a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, highly recommended.
