This is the most critical film in the center of Antonioni's postponement quickly, as a 'defective' look at the 60s American youth / politics culture. For what it's worth, I've found it more touchy and memorable than its acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotions & empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a frame for Antonioni's brilliant observation, and critics on American culture, student life, culture, contention, and the entire anti-war, anti-war backlash that has been so important then . <br /> Even in a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably crafted movie; from the opening credit sequence of the 'Love-In' Desert, in the billboards use, and right down to that jaw-dropping, final cathartic that uses 17 camera set-ups (in its own way, as powerful as Pi the big point in the wild bunch). Also, Antonioni has chosen a single hell of a leading lady and Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to favor the screen. There are many 'acts' involved, as this feels more like a docu-drama, and so the non-professional use as the lead couple works quite effectively in that context. And the band is not just full of beautiful music, its use is impressive as well (I can not forget the start of the movie, mainly due to the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - that visual sounds are well). br /> <br /> Unlike popular opinions, this is quite a success in movies, and one I would like to recommend for anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off-beat. Well worth looking out, and one of these key films in the 60s requiring a DVD / release restoration.
