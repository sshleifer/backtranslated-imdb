Only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been there was more to draw in the movie, but somehow Moonwalker this day remained a fun hobby of music, dance and entertainment. Starting with the video clip clip from Jackson's long career, she reminds the viewer of just why she is often considered the 'king of pop'. From striking him 'I want you back' in the 'We are the world' multi-award reward charity for the benefit of Africa. After a short film of quality, although subtle in a Oscar script, however, gives a fantastic and fun drama to the audience. End with a perfect (sexy!) Pronounced in 'Come Together'. One thing the whole family can look and enjoy.
