The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate it as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it does not really fit in the genre of movies that came from the early 90s. I do not really think it can be considered a noir film, but it is very dark at times, due mainly to the lighting and odd personality of the characters. <br /> <br /> Performance typical of each of the three main actors, which all did a great job and their role. I thought, however, Hopper and Boyle characters were left unveiled, as it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did. Hopper is a love to him or hate him kind of guy. The draw is really good, and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic, there was part where I had to hand it to the director (that's when he first saw the sheriff). All in all, this film is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
