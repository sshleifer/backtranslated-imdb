It's not a big movie. The act is not amazing (some sub charterers even played badly), the movie is not nice in any sense. Nothing really invented or new. If you love big movie, this one is not for you. yet it has a great - really much more about the story. Larry's story story, because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we did not ask at a date, the test we had failed, the friend we left down, are all in our story. This movie works, because it touches it, It's a great story because it's a bit. It's our life all we have, and regret we all have, and yet the message hit: every life we ​​might have lived would have been the downside. The first time I watched it, I was 15. It was shown to be part of my school. 16 years later, I kept reflecting on it every time in a while, and every time I saw it, she put a smile on my face. Look-l. It will do you well. You will be happier with what you have.
