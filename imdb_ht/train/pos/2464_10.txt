One of the best movie-dramas I've ever seen. We do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that emphasizes all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this one, especially for people with an interest in acting, as a "must see." There are several scores. For one, the scenic scenes when Hamlet encounters Yorick (everyone knows about that scene does not just go to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was very well done. The logic used in this scene was tremendous - I suppose a Shakespeare test more than anything else. For the second time, I greatly enjoyed the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussing the upcoming duel.
