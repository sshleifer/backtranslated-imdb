George Raft as Steve Brodie, gambler against dancing, who can never deny a dare, pitted against lumbering, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery) .A soft touch for every panhandler, Connors impulsively adopts waif and loss, better runaway orphans "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) Lucy Calhoun's hometown, an innocent city with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> In this men-dominated culture, communication takes place primarily in the form of violence (one sees why BOWERY is a favorite Martin Scorsese). Explain cigar offering a gag running. Swipes enjoy throwing stones at the windows of Chinatown, on an occasion setting a chicken laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of both Bridie and Beery company firms volunteering volumes leads to a brawl, during which the building is burned to the ground.) Beery relaxed to sip a girl troublesome, and thumps anyone who agrees with her Includes Brodie, whom he defeats, in a night-time fight on a damp pack, to regain his saloon control, losing a bet that Brodie would not have the courage to fly on Bridge Brooklyn. (Brodie makes the growth, but only because a subterfuge and a dummy fail at the last moment.) As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrates and relishes the daily life of the bucks; chanting bully, bully bullying, whispering in the suicide hall was hustled in the Black Maria, hikless hikless tailor in the street and forced to buy the costumes do not want to. A small movie, but admirable small movie.
