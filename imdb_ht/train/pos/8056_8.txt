This photograph in 1935 has gone far with all sorts of Ocars for Best Director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Calling Out the Marines", '42, has given an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who was part of a crowd struggling for a cause and at the same time getting worse and poorer and plenty of drink. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend in order to take a trip to his hometown of America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Newspaper", '43, has given a great support as a leader in the Irish rebellion and has been worried to take the reformer into his group. Gypo Nolan gets haunted by betrayal of his friends and begins to feel just like a Juda. Great movie for 1935 and beautiful action by McLaglen, but rather depressing in all aspects of the movie.
