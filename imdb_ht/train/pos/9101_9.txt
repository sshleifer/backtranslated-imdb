The movie examines the life of five women Adela, Leire, Maricarmen, Anita & Isabel ?? which has completely different life and choice of shoes.

In a teaser and embroidery manner, a podiatrist tried to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's soul by the sole of her foot. The first is risky and slightly flawless, but the tone and depth of the film take a daring dip for the good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! , the confusion, the hope, the needs and escaping mechanism develop in minutes different rooms in the house and down the street and eventually below ...
