Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hit-person or professional killer, decided to leave the business, and his senior employer does not agree. In terms of content, this film is very enjoyable action not one; in terms of absolute entertainment, it is fun ?? It is very melodramatic, violent, brutal, chases the cars are remarkable. "Arzenta" is a unpretentious, yet very likable movie ?? better than the current Hollywoodian waste label that gets the same label. It comes from the Delon rather short flirtation with the Italian C film in the '70s. She carefully used Delon's tough guy character, which belongs to the gallery of bad ass as he did in his youth. <br /> I enjoyed the fact that Delon had made this movie, that he had a role in a good Eurocrime flick. The score is very good, with a good song introduction? making sense that the Italian castings for the movie are considered a synthetic work, where the art music has an important part. <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / There is no way out of the highly appealing Blank (31 years of '73) to appear as an anonymous hooker. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, played by Carla Gravina (a starlet that practically left the movies after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" is interesting to filmed? An ambitious visual conception, has some peculiar angle expressions. The film was directed by Pricific Duccio Tessari, one of Zorro's actors (Delon Comedy) .Evenly mentioning that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very unrealistic. The first one is a Without melodramatic violent movie action - the second is a lighthearted comedy, more families in a parody, though considerably coherent and skilfully made.Duccio Tessari directed film like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966) Satan, Butterfly in blood, Viva La Muerte ... You! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
