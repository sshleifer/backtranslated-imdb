The first time I had windows of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's, in one of our art houses as a revival. As I watched fever dreams in an exercise in the 1930s sexuality, I thought YOWZA! They went and killed in Europe back in the day. Unfortunately, this film was heavily cut off by its original US released by the blue Hayes Office (government sensation of government sensation, started by the "holier than you" bible bib, Will Hayes ... a former Post Office official, if you can believe that), due to its general theme of human sexuality (in heaven forbidden to actually have sex in the 1930s). The plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries an older man, and later regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets a beautiful little man and has a deal with her, causing a divorce from her husband (another no one in Hollywood movies then - Divorce!) . Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time the director worked in the sound format (so the movie seems to possess the techniques used primarily in silent films --- i.e 1920 the expressionism). It is always worth looking out for a window in the early European speaking pictures, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930), and the Karl Gustav Dryer 'Vampyre' (1931). Not rated, but this sad naughty naughty cheat guy & some obvious genetic references, would cost little more than a PG-13 by today's standards (but it would have easily landed the 'x' daunting, back to the to 30, if it existed then)
