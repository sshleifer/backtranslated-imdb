I'd hear about Eddie Izzard, but never saw him in action. I knew she was a transvestite, and when I saw she was on HBO last night's night, I put her on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blows us away. It's better than Robin Williams ever. It has total audience control; When it does 'Englebert's death - no it's not', routine, the audience does not know what to think in the end. God like James Mason is also an inspiring touch, and his version of the Spanish Python Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - 'Cake or Death?' it is priceless. My jaws were painful at the end of the show. We've been watching the TVs for months later to be able to see her again, and being lucky enough to tap her in the next time she came over. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything with her tape, you will not be disappointed.
