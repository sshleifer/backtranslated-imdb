I really said, this was always a favorite to me when I went to see my grandmother. And it is still. It's very, very close to the book. The way he filmed, and the players were just all excellent! I must recommend this movie to anyone who does not see it. Almost everyone I talked to hate TV movies, but this was really great! I gave it 10/10.
