First of all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so there was no chance I would be disappointed in that aspect. The biggest flaw that I have spotted was historical details, and several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think not part of that time. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is OK, there is nothing to brag about. But acting, I think, was terrific. I have no experience to act, still I can not believe how people can consider this terrible! Maybe they only saw two movies (all the time), and the other one was pretty good indeed! <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood her character, someone who pulled up the social ladder and worked very hard, then fighting against who would take his life work in his hands, Only he gets involved in this fight, he does not realize why he's not in his side, and ends up a beating, shame people. Irons made this credible, I am sympathized with the character despite his brutality. <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman, who draws to the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas, having a partial developing, I think), and Glenn Close also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just by up to the standards of other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's cinema, here are just the interpretations, only those who have problems, but at the same time, it is not a movie pretend, too worried trying intellectual. The best evidence I really like, I wrote a review 7 years later.
