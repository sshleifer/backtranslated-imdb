I've seen a lot of movie cinemas and always find the way to meet music, dance, drama and movie theater in his movies. The Ib√©ria shows even better sura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that calls my attention is the fact that, in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music, are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, examining not only technical issues, but also the emotional experience of playing . The interest in Saura on the bridge between classic and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie perhaps the most stimulating aesthetics among its other tasks. That is why I strongly recommend it to those who love good movies, good music, good dance, great art.
