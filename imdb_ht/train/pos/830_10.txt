I did not have much to wait to go to the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. She has cast the Slick Armory Slick for a ridiculous look and she has shown that she is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play on each other and make one of their best friend friends in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances by Brosnan, Kinnear, and Hope Davis are great, mixed with a touching element in the story about friendship, and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best friends in a long time. This is a movie that definitely shows that we can expect much of the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
