Very nicely to make movies. It stays in your memory. The best bills as a romance than flying or war, alto the flying parties are realistic and almost free errors. Flying enthusiasts like I'm going to enjoy this movie though attracting the aircraft, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun is watching early Crowe. It is good and reluctant to charm. His reading of "High Flight" is superb. <br /> <br /> cheers, boom
