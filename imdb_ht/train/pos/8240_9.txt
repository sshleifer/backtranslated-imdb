I was also in the hands of the premiere of Toronto. This movie was sort of a consolation when I thought I could not get in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally blown away. Since I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, i actually forgotten who was even in it.) Performance performance from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great at a true departure from his day as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think that since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly that there is no line-that-all-ever. Children were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. <br /> And, by the way, I got to see my first choice anyway - and that was the best way.
