This is one of those rare movies, it's nice and compelling, dignified and original, a true gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any vacation at all, because it reminds you to open yourself up to a wider experience (Yes, get the magic). I especially love Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actor is impeccable in this film. Further costumes, if you are designing fashionable and costume, are extraordinarily well done. I just want to drop it on DVD because I put my tape version out! <br /> <br /> Absolutely well worth your time, just be sure to settle in her look, without any interruption.
