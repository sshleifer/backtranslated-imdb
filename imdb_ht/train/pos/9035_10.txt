Acting in this movie was superb. As an amateur rocket, I get so many mistakes. As a human, it touches my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you would think they are the real characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, does not leave anything out of her performance. Young actors playing small rockets have shown talent beyond the years, especially young Homer. Father Homer has inspired that eternal love / eternal relationship between a father and his child that he felt real. If you do not get one stroke in your throat or shed a water then rock star first success or when father and son become term, then get your heartbeat checked (you can die).
