I thought this movie was pretty plotting it made me confused with my cousin who looked at her with me. to tell the truth I think the little kevin dillon was cho.hahahaha ... but i think also the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and what was wrong what he said before he died "I was inside you" .I think he's got to do what he did with him and how she will tell her that she is too young when she never cared about how old the other girls were. do not think i could ever trust a cop such. But tell truth he was very obvious he was him though he wanted to become a cop I would always be suspicious of him either way.and that was funny when he spit it in the eye at store.hahahahaha.she was still stupid to go to the store again by himself and so was the cop who died HELLO! it calls back-up.sometimes these movies make me angry when people act stupid and stupid things. But that's what I think a thought about the movie.
