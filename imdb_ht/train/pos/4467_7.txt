Movie is absolutely enjoyable and dancing movie that starts with Frank Sinatra and has Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. The film won with Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and won nominations for Best Photos, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Movies, as well as a Best Child Nomination for "I Fall in Love" too Easy singing not sinatra. <br /> It was a beautiful story about Kelly helping her palatable Sinatra find a girl and fell in love with herself. The beautiful Grayson (bread in New Orleans) dazzles us with his songs, and we have a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistic of pianist-conductor JosÃ© Iturbi. /> A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by.
