I have been to see this flick of film for the past few months. I was actually amazed at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of young adolescents who intimidated a boy called Marty. They are constantly intimidating him until one of them makes a horrible mistake that leaves Marty horribly burned. A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school that is now abandoned for a party. Though, none of the reckless teens organized this part. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, the teenagers begin to die in the worst possible way. I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well. <br /> At the end of the movie, you get out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But Marty is in the hospital with serious burns. Although the killers did not happen, the burns and the pranks apparently arrived. <br /> <br /> The act is terrible but that's fine. <br /> I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what comes to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting sweet revenge. <br /> I would recommend anyone to choose this if you are looking for 80s slashers. /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars from 10. Slasher good cheese!
