If you want to remember MJ, this is a great place to start. This film features sweet tunes, MJ as robots, and a crazy, drawn-up draw. I remember, many a night, passing out of this movie features fine college, and meditating on the absolute awesomenes of anyone who decides light green this ridiculous piece of .. There are many songs. Many dancing. There are many songs while dancing. MJ kills it as you expect when it comes to this. But there are many more this movie. There are claymation. There are children fat (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson has to battle in the dance (obviously agile too). There are Joe Pesci as well (not made in clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
