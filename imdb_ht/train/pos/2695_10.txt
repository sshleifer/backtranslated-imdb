What keeps us going - or at least I feel that the writer wants us to keep you stuck in an early point is our desire to know if Martinaud has made the deed deed. Without much damage, of course there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that this is the story of Martinaud's flaws and his difficulty in dealing with. When there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize with his mercy because as the story progresses we have to think it is ill, perverted the pedophile that we are predicting in mind. One of the things he has to deal with is the distant distraction he and his wife have though they live on the same roof. These issues of course are given the denouement of the final shocking film. <br /> <br /> This movie requires your patience and it certainly has tried those young teens sitting in the rear. They were avoided obviously because they are not part of the "central center" movie. Although there is a bit of travel, when we arrive at the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as clever as we have been to think it is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
