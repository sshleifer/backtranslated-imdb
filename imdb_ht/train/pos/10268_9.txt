This typical Mamet movie delivers a quiet, insistent gameplay rhythm into what makes a trust person (Joe Mantegna) good. Exploring as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), she slowly pulled her into her world with the normal embarrassment consequences. The cast includes a number of players found in several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they are doing the right work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie, and they often wonder why he did not become a more noted player he came. Maybe I'm not looking at their places! The movie continues at a slow, slow and flat dialogue, yet it keeps a level of tension at all that logically leads to the bang-up finish. You would expect a real to go down to the finish, but I found it uplifted and satisfied. I like this movie!
