Composed, elegant Carol (wonderful play by Rebecca Brooke's lovely), her lovely husband Eddie (charming David Houseman), Carol's Wacky, is still eating better Pal Puppies Anna (Delightful Writing and Funny Infected Wings by Adorable Chris Side Jordan, and Anna's hunky, romantic husband Pete (a typical fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet of freed swingers who enjoy having sex with each other. They routinely become disturbed when Carol, solitary, reprimanded, but still entertaining young Jennifer widow Jennifer (a superbly performing performance by Jennifer Welles) is not for a visit. Just take a moment Jennifer delivers up and becomes an unwilling participant in the swingers' pleasurable and uninhibited form of carnal, and everyone except Carol wants to seduce it. Writer / director Joe Sarno concerts a sharp, refreshing, and perceptive subject of suburban ambitions and the boundaries of the 70-year-old wildlife revolution; Sarno turns traditional middle-class mores on the head and more spices and a mother / inducer / daughter's expression. In addition, Sarno elicited exactly the first-rate acting out of the bang-up cast: Welles and Brooke are both exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as tin New Age sex therapist Shandara , and Erica Eaton as Mrs. Garden neighbors. Better yet, all women are very hot and catchy; Welles in particular seriously steamed up the screen and his face lascivious abduction and childhood presence eroticism. The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit, but never raunchy or exhausting. Bright colors, polished Stephen Polwell, and Jack Justis bouncy, note the acoustic club tunes both on the solid and efficient money. Recommended look for fans Sarno.
