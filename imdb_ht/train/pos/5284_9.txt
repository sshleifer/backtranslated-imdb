Fathers and sons communicate very much. In fact they speak different languages. Staying when the son drove his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the conversations finally took place. They are difficult and the growth is needed on both parties. This film takes you to the hearts of these two travelers, and it is indeed a great journey for the audience as well as two principals. The entire image is impressive, especially the final scenes of Mecca. He underlined for me once again how many different worlds can be, but also at the same time, the same way. The same was true for the father and son of this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You will be glad you have done.
