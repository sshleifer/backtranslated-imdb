Great voices, many adventure and intelligent dialogue make this a very good movie. In addition to the "character" of the lead lead three gives the story a lot more depth and significance, particularly the relationship between fellow older, shadow, and young Hellraiser, lucky. The earlier versions of this movie were able to provide the animals of any real personality or motif, which is done perfectly here. Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this movie like Feline Fell, the Sassy. Great contrast between chat and dog perspective on life, and just the right amount of spirits and hot fuzzies to make the plot and excellent resolution. There's even a luminous note and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with kids. Hats go to Disney.
