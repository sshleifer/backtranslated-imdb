An extra cry to play a general in a movie about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not any extra ordinary. He is Serguis Alexander, former commander of the Russian army who is now being forced to relive the same scene, which he suffered from professional and personal tragedy, meeting the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and was outraged by Alexander. He can now be the time for the man to break ultimately "winning" his penultimate battle. This is one powerful film and meticulous direction by Von Sternberg, giving the greatest irony of Alexander's character in every way it can. Jannings deserves his Oscar for the role and performance of a very moving general play in his picks and deepest depths. Powell lends a disaster support as the mindset director and Brent is perfect in his role and his face and moves that show much expression as Jannings' love. All around shine. Rating, 10.
