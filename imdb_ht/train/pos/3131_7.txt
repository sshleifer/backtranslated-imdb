I really liked this. I got it thinking he would be a documentary, but he revealed himself as a good piece of tongue in pigeon fun. <br /> I think this was well done, pretty much a TV show extended to a movie, but due to the characters or rather the original will willingness to have fun and be made fun off to help this great work old style Innocent style. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original TV series then I'm sure you'll enjoy this
