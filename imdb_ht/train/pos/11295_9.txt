This movie has always been a favorite since I first saw it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when she was featured on a Los Angeles TV show. Characters are very engaged since the start of the photo, and it's too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to a ban by Real Estate of Moss Hart, the dramatche / producer / director who wrote the story and first introduced him on stage in New York during WWII - the reason for refusing to show it is difficult to fathom more than 50 years after he did). I have not seen the movie again for more than 30 years, when someone who was actually a big cast member of the movie was able to get me a "bootlegged" copy on VHS (poor quality video, but good audio ). My memory of it was incorrect: it was still a film engaging and fascinating to watch. An amazing aspect of this film is just how much of its stars, just starting out in their careers at the time of 1944), it's going to become either big star motion picture or at least well known and fully employed actor (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Button, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill). The scenes with Liberator B-24 are terrific, especially the shutter shut-up where the details of the giant (for those times) 4 bomber engine (then 18,000 + manufactured, now almost disappeared) can be seen. Good insight at different levels in training that a Pilot-Cadet went through on his way being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, very gender-partial as it was the trend of the day: only the person came to pilot, women just support them in their role - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope one day it will be released on video for a new generation to enjoy.
