This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling when watching this and was already watching it twice in a 2-day period! The film is uniquely unique in its humorous and visual, both are terrific and on par with Natali's other (more serious) films Cube Wonders and Cypher. I became a great fan of Vincenzo Natali ever since watching Cypher and everything he did is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very likable on this movie are the music and "deficit" characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story), my actors both as many. Also cool are the X-Box Battle Dead or Alive (you even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and amazing Andrew guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> All in all a great feel-good movie about friendship. You will see that!
