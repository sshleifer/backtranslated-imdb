I must say, I was amazed at the quality of the movie. It was far better than I expected. Scenario and acting are good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes look somewhat clumsy, it's a decent movie in general. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself until the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere has been well received. The draw was clear, consistent and profound. Some people can find it a bit boring even though the story line is very focused and takes the time for character and story development. Moral in the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is amazingly good.
