I can remember this movie from when I was a toddler, I loved it then and I still do now. I managed to find it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was happy because I found it so difficult to find it was and was only renting when I was younger. My favorite Charlie is Charlie because she learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the characters are perfect. This movie was still a tearjerker for me but I thought if I had not seen the movie when I was small then I would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as I did although I still believe I would still love It's because I'm really in anime movies.
