I've heard good about this movie and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; Really all (small) dropping is quite solid, in the simple 50s American environment. The reason I did not rate this higher film is especially that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister did not seem so real and this pulled me out of the movie a bit. Maybe we hope to fill in the plot, or maybe the movie needs to be a little longer. Maureen's character is well underdeveloped. He understands that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) should be traumatized and angry, but why does his sister show more angry? Because it's a few years older? Does not end in rather weaken the rest of the movie? The film rally makes it seem that Maureen and Court have just just met, when it gets traktored (warning: This scene is amazingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock somewhat. work!). It depends on what you want - if you want to cheer the girls in love love that it looks like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise. Man of the Moon is both picturesque and in dreams with a harshest movie of ?? a rather awkward combination? I liked the Court character though, I can see what girls watching this can look. And I loved being bravely in both leaving her sore little boy (most men would have, most movies would not) and get killed. <br /> 7/10 on my pretty obvious harsh scale. For some reason I found Jason London on a funny tractor.
