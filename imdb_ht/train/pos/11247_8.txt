I saw the first movie when she landed on US cable one year after she came out. It sounded my little head away, I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I'd heard, having a strict solicitation, classic kid growing. The music is fascinating to me, as does O'Connor's amazing look and vocal performance vocal, and hard but handsome Phil Daniels' manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged out sax player. It was so out of place in the group and so harmless and pathetic, it just asked empathy. Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights come out, and the love scene of the train. <br /> <br /> Well, so the movie is not the Rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and its painting in Britain's early 80's, exploding and rebel youth, looking for a way out of the gentle queue. I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie being very meditative in the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, see it. It's a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
