In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler were singing and dancing the ways in three musicals Warner brothers who offered ephemeral hearing a momentary distraction from their misery. Gold Diggers in 1933, 42nd Street and Paratroop Parade have been put into the world of Broadway Theater and basically the same theme at the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the kaleidiskopic cartoons of Busby Berkeley, show up tunes and many of the same players support. <br /> <br /> All of them are biting classics in the genres, but I must admit a clear preference to relieve due to its speed of energy and lead to James Cagney. Warren William of Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter at 42nd Street found themselves admirable as the top-performing show - particularly Baxter as burning out Julian Marsh in search of one recent breaking box office. Both the infectious energy shortage of Cagney however, perfectly complements the frenetic pace in putting on a Broadway music. It's an absolute whirlpool as it deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold girlfriend dig. <br /> Of course Cagney alone does not make the classic Footlight that it is. The krackles script and some early entrants were delivered by a superficial cast casting featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cut everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risky and make just the nick of time before arriving in the Hollywood Code at 34. Unfortunately, the thirty and sometime beyond could never be seen as a music that has done so much and the verve and sass of light again. Justice and morality made sure it.
