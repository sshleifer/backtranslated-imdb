This is a very dark and intriguing horror-type horror based on the idea of ​​murder monks. The scenario centered on a disruptive man residing in Texas, United States who suddenly went on a killing island with his two sons after being instructed by redemption of the world of evil. <br /> Bill Paxton directed this movie deranged dad who is known as the hand of God Assassin while Matthew McConaughey plays his finest performance to date as the oldest son, Fenton Meix. The movie revolves around Fenton who decides he can not keep the burden of his childhood alone and uses the rein to emphasize the story of FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> I can not think of many movies that literally hold the viewer chains in the chairs since the start of finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you can not be because of the absolute power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this movie very well, and help to put the plot into the good scenery. Acting in this movie is great but if there is a disadvantage it is that some parties are very powerful and may bother some people. <br /> <br /> Also the concept of this movie is very black, the kids help show the idea through brilliant acting. This really is a spine tingly pride and it is guaranteed to have you in the corner of your seat at all. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horrors, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> 8/10
