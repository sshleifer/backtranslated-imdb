I could not agree more with the nomad 7 and I commented on the HVR. A perfect setting back Sunday morning movie. Humor is subtle (exact opposite of "slapstick" as a lean comment noted). <br /> But what's always surprising me is how often I find myself wanting to go back to this movie over and over. I originally copied this movie about VHS about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of these free cabinet free cabins free (HBO maybe?). Never heard of it already. Do not know why it has not been marketed well. ?? When the DVDs were released massively, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great combination to throw and write. Plus, the drop back to Montana's desert does not hurt either (beautiful) things. It's probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what? If Adam Sandler kind of thing is up to you, this probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie needs all your attention. The humor is mostly in the dialogue. <br /> I believe my next look will probably be on my 12th. But I still know that when it comes to the scenes like the one where the hoops of the police cars start blowing, I'll drop it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). Recommended 110%.
