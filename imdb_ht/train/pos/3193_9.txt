The short film that begins this film is true to a guy named Gary, apparently he took randomly in the parking lot at a television station where Gary works in Beaver City. Gary is a little "different"; It is an impersonator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Watch and see the film maker gets a letter from Gary some time later inviting him to return to Beaver to get some footage from the local talent competition he has put together, including Gary's Performace winner as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, me. The following shorts are Gary's story, the same one you just witness only the first is described by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover titled "The Orkly Kid." If you are in the mood for the fun of someone this is definitely the movie to watch. I was duplicating about and laughing at most of her, especially Crispins performance that could definitely stand on her own. When it was over, I had to rewind the movie once again looking at the real Gary and all its bright stylish. Although Olivia was concentrating, I would like to see one of the "friendly" buttons of a button at the Imperial Barry Gry, Whic h was equally ridiculous.
