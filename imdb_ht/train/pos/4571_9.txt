The most important thing about this film is brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, gina artisans and fighters who despite their fitness beat all their chances. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shocking to convince. The enormous support that Christy formed his family, low income, working Dubliners, encouraged him to make the impossible and this picture shows that this brilliant support does not read the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to take personality elegant Christy Brown a. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially classic movie-lovers.
