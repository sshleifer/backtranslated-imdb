I think the team behind this film did a great job with the limits they had. Only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and modify the whole thing that I think is a success in itself. although this film is not for the masses (like a young innocent young boy who has died and has homosexuality-involved in the story) I think this movie is a wrenching heart attack and most deeply involved in you in the story The more sadness you feel. more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels, but does not return. <br /> This is one of my favorite British films that I enjoyed so much and would look again. I think it's a shame that the film is not very well heard at all.
