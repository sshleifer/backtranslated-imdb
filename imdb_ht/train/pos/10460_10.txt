This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the impacts of the horrific illness on the family. Well-behaved and well-directed. If there were any flaws, I should say that the story showed the typical suburban family and the hardships again. What about all of all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a movie where all these cultures are shown - as in real life. But the movie has risen in terms of its value and its understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to it or its maker. I liked the movie and it brought tears in my eyes
