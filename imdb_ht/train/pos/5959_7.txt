While this movie will not go down to the story of great movies, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally being released to videos where it should be debuted in the first place. The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for the dinner called "The Hunger Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a substitute in order to find a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-like mystery man who gets his girlfriend. Fox provides a discreet and touching performance and Nunn is reliable talent as always. Micheal des Barres is a small as an attorney on top. The ensemble flows - made up of familiar faces - work nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters into their lives. This is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.
