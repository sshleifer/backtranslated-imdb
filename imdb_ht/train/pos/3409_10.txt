South Africa in the 1930s. In a small Arabic town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for the meaning of her life & a Trappist monster saved from her crisis of faith. They will meet with their passion will be agitated, but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in the Allah field. <br /> <br /> The draw is hokum pi, but the movie is always great fun & nice look. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. It is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and Boyer give a more effective, understated performance, leaving her sensitive face doing much to act her for her. <br /> <br /> Throw in support is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a county that loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, guitar speaker (all the "Arabic" read & others speaking in the movie is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a Gentleman; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious sand Divine; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise priest of old age. <br /> <br /> Maven movie will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a wet; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (peeking on the shoulder at the time) as convent girls; gang Nigel De Brulier as a lector of monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all accredited. <br /> <br /> The color film in the 1930s is both rare and beautiful looking, and this film is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. DAY OF ALLAH was the first Teknikolor film to be shot aside. Yuma, Arizona gave the movie makers all the sand dunes can be desirable, but contaminated drinking water & 135 degrees heat soon had the company of riots. When everyday rushes showed Boyer's face burned a red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally gave in. The rest of the movie was shot on a Hollywood sound stage.
