12 year old Arnald Hillman accidentally killed his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with it (or feel it is not the right thing to do). Only his shelter is his grandfather, which is the only one who seems to have compassion on him. The realist will capture "true-2-life" movie lovers, but will not satisfy those desires action & emotions.
