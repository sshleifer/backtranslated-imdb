I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) really was a dull guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie has done an absolutely outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you for any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fans who have not seen it. You are in so many laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
