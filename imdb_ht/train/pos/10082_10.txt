The film is really intense, unique and uplifting. The story is universal in that it's a battle between good, evil and the world between. The most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesti. Blockbuster has been rated as if it was an X rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple sub-titles.
