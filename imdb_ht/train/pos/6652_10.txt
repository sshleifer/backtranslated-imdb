I saw the movie and really could not stop tears. His tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom, whose audacity does justice to their own children, does not behave properly .. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and abilities .. I remember the dialogue in Gandhi 'What kind of society do we want to create with the people (on Harilal)?' No wonder that it will be a dream that India will hardly be the leader of this generation or next. Einstein was good when he said on Gandhi that 'After 50 years one would hardly believe that these people and bodies, souls and Yourself (Mahatma Gandhi) has never lived on this earth. 'I sincerely want a lot of Anil Kapoor, Feroz Khan and all actor / actress for this wonderful movie about great people and relationships with his son. All fathers and sons should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
