I remember when I first saw this short, I really laughed so hard, that like with a lot of other films that I saw, no sound out! Curly is really great at singing this opera in this one, I'm surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good! If you notice, this was filmed in the Curly Care Center as a Stooge, you could really say it had changed because it had lost weight and it was thin, his voice was deepening, his face was getting lined up and Wrinkles, though it could still pull it off, it seemed that it was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he suffered a lot of minor injuries before one big one who ended his career. May he still manage to pull it to his last person! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that Curly has really become very sick at this point, this is actually one of the funniest shorts. I know that I did not mind the fact that Curly had really changed because I always thought it was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
