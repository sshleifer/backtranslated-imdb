Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good acting. Good Direct. Good art direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good correction. Good things. Put it all together and enjoy good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame in it is that there are not nearly enough films in this caliber to have these days. We can count on the chances that writers / directors such as John Hughes can occasionally make their creative voices heard. <br /> Every time I notice that I'm watching a movie for the third or fourth time and still finds it quite satisfying I must conclude that something about that movie is right.
