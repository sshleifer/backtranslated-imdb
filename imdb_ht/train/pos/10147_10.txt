Anyone who knows the exact quote on "Time and Love" by George Help aka, Papa Fitzpatrick in the Movement, Was It Yours? He talked to Charlie and Annna in the church as they left? If not I will have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also love serendipity! Huge love story for the soul! I met my one love (Soulmate I) and although I had the experience to meet her when I was younger, she was not ready for the emotional relationship. <br /> Alto, we were married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got satisfied and took her love for granted and kept it for 7 years. <br /> It was finally left with resentment but we still hurt and angry & in disbelief on the way it turned out. I had some very difficult lessons to learn and we now have been apart from 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I'm still waiting on reconciliation with my one and only true love. I can now appreciate the different feelings inside of me and Papa Fitzpatrick's quote was true to me. <br /> I know when he's healed enough to trust me again, we'll be remarried. <br /> Never take place and take good care! She has the most difficult lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> Also the music of this movie is OUTSTANDING and HOUSEHOLDS! This film is DEEP and spiritually relieved. True love is worth anything, if it means it, it will, no matter what, it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around! Thanks!
