I was glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie where the head was not the goal. Her character is like all of us. Want more - the best thing to happen to us and wait for God to deliver. Morgan Freeman has made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a small vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's basically self-centered TV-animated wish-but that's the way he wrote. <br /> I think the forecasts are shattering several scenes potentially very funny because everyone who saw they knew what had happened before it happened. /> <br /> I have read a number of reviews and it seems some people are looking for a bit too deep. This is a summer comedy and it does not mean that they solve problems in the world although there are a few messages we all can take in heart. <br /> A funny movie.
