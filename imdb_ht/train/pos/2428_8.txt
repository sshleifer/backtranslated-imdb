As an old white wife I can always appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. Anyone appreciating his work as Deep Cover can enjoy watching this actor's incredible act acting. Since I think this is his first director it might prove even more interesting. All of the act is good. If you can not get down to Manhattan junky world or the reality of crime life (do not praise action-shoot em ups) then this is not a movie you would like. He is the owner of Mr. Fishburne's incredibly subtle relationship. I would like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins going to each other a few days in a movie.
