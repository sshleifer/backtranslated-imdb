Bette Midler is yet divine! Raunchily humorous. In love with Burlesque. Can bring you down to tears with old jokes and new dresses or simply with old songs that are more powerful & ponch than ever. All of the new singing new songs, the power-singing good old / endless songs like the "Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Van under my wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always loved - since this is the next best thing for her, I recommend everyone with a mixture of magic widespread eyed and appreciation and thirst for a child to push all limit!
