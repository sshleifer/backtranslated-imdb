There's a certain attraction I've always found in discovering the great (semi) movie unknown. These discoveries are almost always dramatic films - in my experience, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video in a junk shop, mixing among dozens of countless different types of tapes. Of course, this is the only place I would find it, as it is still not on DVD. <br /> While I was watching Judy Davis (like Lillie) in all of this movie course, I was somehow sure I watched an unparalleled performance. Yes, I've already seen davis in several small parts - with one role in "A Passage in India". But although it was superb in the aforementioned film, "High Tide" is a different animal entirely. Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong's film, "Charlotte Gray", I was acutely aware of the actress who impressed her. Davis draws more than one resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both ways and tenderness. Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I can not say enough good things about it. She shares an amazing relationship on screen with young Claudia Karvan (like Ally), another movie actress. There are a lot of drama and humanity imitating to share together, the details of which I will not be supposed to reveal here (see it for yourself!). There are too many good at "High Tide" to cover in one review. Indeed, I would hardly care - the movie speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise Senator Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors, and great Russell Boyd for her brilliant, understated movies (please refer to her work at "Mercy Mercies").
