One of the best films I've seen in the past five years! The cast is universal spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on Lower East Side in New York City and two driveways were superstar in the making. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing take on the urban youth who puts Larry Clark often-nauseating shtick in the sailor where he belongs ... although I have admitted that Bully was a higher cut price its normal ticket. Increasing Victor Vargas is a movie you will kick yourself for missing ... So do not miss it!
