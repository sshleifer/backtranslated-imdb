In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a Klingon Klang Klinang shooter and his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane shop in his garden, Klingon sent to the Starfleet Hospital. Ambassador Vulcan Soval proposes to remove the life support system and carry Klaang's corps for his mighty empire in Kronos and honor.

After the autopsy of the Suliban was killed in the shooting, Captain Archer informed by Dr. Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, switching to a genetic sophisticated genetic process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise for following the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches Riger X planet. Investigating and releasing that Klaang was a courier, bringing an important message about the temporary cold war from Suliban Sarin leaders of the Klingons of Kronos. In spite of being a big fan of Star Trek, I have not followed the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable TVs. I decided to buy the DVD box in the first season and this first episode surprised me. Adventure of the First Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, The Gorgeous T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Exit is excellent, at least in this pilot. I noted in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVDs are only one, that's why my review is valid for both. I did not like the theme of music note, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception to this great show. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
