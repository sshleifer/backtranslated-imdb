This movie could be a silent film; It certainly has the feeling of one. I was very, very fortunate to see this very rare version of this movie. Exstaz, is a 'symphony of love', and transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, looks quite appropriate for this very sensual and lyric version. Teen Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen, in this movie that, in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic. High quality power was a little bit; but that does not detect from the magic movie spell this ezit. A lovers of early movies, would absolutely worship this movie.
