The Harry Hall series began with very cop copies, and was almost immediately enlightened up for "Magnum Force". Since the "Anforcer" rolled around, Harry's room was little more than a TV show show (saved only by Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Harry's room finally goes back to his roots. Maybe he went for too long this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes the first Harry movie that has been well-directed since Don Siegel made the debut, which helps considerably. Harry is a bold character once again, by the beautiful cop he came. It can once again say things like "Go ahead, make my day" and really mean it. "Often impact" is a true good Harry end. The "Enforcer" should never be born. <br /> 7.2 out of 10
