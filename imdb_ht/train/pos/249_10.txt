I saw the trailer for this movie several times over, and I must say that Ned Kelly looks like it will be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (he had my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, piece period. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who sees for a second split looks fantastic. I think this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again to many people.
