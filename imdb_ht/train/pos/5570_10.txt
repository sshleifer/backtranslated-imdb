This movie is Sophmoric. But it's funny as all get out. It shows "boys locker room boys" played by the "other side". It's good to see these tides turn and how amazing they are. But this is probably not news for most women, 'cause (just ask one), "they've heard' em all before". Look at it with a small group or part of mixed sex and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... can you ever really please them?
