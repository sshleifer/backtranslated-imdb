<br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watch it for the first time the other night. I was a fan of Tolkien's job for about 4 years now, ever since I got out of high school. I did not grow up on this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away from it. It is definitely not for the kids. Not that it's bad in a graphical sense, but that the terms should be right on most 10 year old heads. In general, the animation was excellent considering this made in 1978/1979. I thought the story follows the book fairly well into a loose sense. But I banned that bashki did not just add another 40 minutes or so and sneak on Returning to the King parties. That would have made it the ultimate film. I was bothered by the end of brutal, and then when I heard the Return of the King sighed, I was bothered even more. Too bad it was not a big movie animation. He might have won a higher vote in my hand. I give it a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will make new books and new LOTR live action books.
