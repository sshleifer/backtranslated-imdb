I'll say this to begin with ... Why, oh why, can not WB do this short film director do? Sandy is obviously an amazing director, and deserves some credits in WB and DC. But I guess they're kind of putting on edge when someone with a $ 12,000 budget can do a super-hero drool fan. The finest world is one of the best short films I have ever seen, trailer or not. <br /> I think choosing a bodibwilde (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a genius choice. Let's face it person, Superman no super model. It may be nice, but a GQ Stud it is not. And I do not know what guys a few comments above me was over, but Superman is actually pretty beefy (Have you ever actually read a funny superman?). I guess that fact alone just floats me ... It seems like an obvious choice to get someone with some muscle-mass current to play a super-hero, rather than a pretty face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible form, with an excellent Batman ... I do not know Ms. ... If they give a bigger budget, with her own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck. Bottom line, This is one of only a few cycles of super-hero cinemas and actors who actually watch the party. <br /> <br /> The actress is beautiful as well. I do not know what everybody is talking about, O'Hearn is not that bad. It is humiliated to convince as Superman, and Bartram ... Well, it's Batman. I mean, come on people, this movie has a $ 12,000 dollar budget, what did you expect?. Everyone else is great too, except De-Face looks a crazier than the usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is very hot too. SFXs are Flippin 'sweet too. I mean, see Superman lifting the car up ... MAN! How cool is that. Versus the "Tanks" scenes of Grayson, I might have to put this one above, since Mike actually looks like flying, with ease. The flying sequences leave something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget ... Oh, And it even uses a Batmobile! (It was probably a model, but it looked asleep to persuade). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible director, and needs to be apart from some kind of a Project ... but no, will (Like most of the Marvel projects) just keep getting those Hack Manager directors Almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out those player movies. Thanks to Superman God has been a hit, or seriously would be the end of it. The world's finest is excellent, and in my book, count as a superhero movie.
