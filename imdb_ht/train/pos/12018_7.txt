*** SPOILERS *** Seething and hatred with revenge half crosses Zach Provo, James Coburn, spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planning his escape. What Provo wants more then freedom is the same note and the man who captured it, and in the process, during a wild shootout, killed his Navajo wife: former Pima County sheriff Sam Burgade, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Using the escaped escape escort lurks burgundy into the vast Arizona desert, by promising them $ 30,000.00 of gold coins that he had buried, Provo's exact blood vengeance plan on Burgade. But only after witnessing that his daughter was brutally raped by his fellow prisoners or their, in not being with a woman for years, like horny like a rabbit during mating season! <br /> <br /> Brutal and highly efficient west-west John Wayne 1956 classic "darling" of a father seeking to threaten the United States for his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston as Sam Burgade's culprit-dog in her womb somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well reach her daughter Susan she is perfect in the role of the sheriff aging and retired. Charles Coburn as the half-vengeful growth of Zach Provo is also at its best as obsessed with hate and murder escaped escape. The man who escaped with Provo is really not interested in his personal affairs, but there is no choice, in that he knows the territory as the back of his hand, but to go along with him. It's only the thought they've made their way to Susan, when Provo gives them the green light, as well as burying him $ 30,000.00 of gold coins that keep them from breaking down and going their own way. Going along with Burgade is Susan's Bridal Susan, Chris Mitchum, who proves to the end that he is as good as Burgade is, who felt he just did not have it at him, in both tracking down Criminals escape as well as using Common Sense, which in this case Burgade lacks, to do it. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The brutal incredible confrontation with bloody confrontation between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit down. Provo in hatred of Burgad bordered on outright madness wanted him to suffer a slow and painful death. It was hated that Bugrade took advantage of and, after taking some half dozen bullets, so ended wearing the thirst and without thirst, as well as mindless, dig for good!
