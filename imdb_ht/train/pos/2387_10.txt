I have a six-month-old baby at home and from time to time it is really a bad fight. One morning he had a particular hard time getting to sleep when the theme song doodle songs came on T.V. It stopped crying almost immediately, and for the rest of the show was content. I sat down in her bouncy chair and looked at her legs, swing her arms, and actually laughed at this show. Has kept him entertained and happy the whole time. I also had a video of them so that at times when my little one is impressive I have something to calm down. Granted, late at night, if he wakes up and gobbles in the fossil bob fossils by his cup of tea, but they are sure to come in handy when I need to briefly do housework, etc. The biggest surprise over doodle is that my child does not even like watching T.V. It would rather be in the floor playing with a game or with our little poodle game than watching T.V. Again, the doodle boots have totally captured his attention. I do not know if he will continue to love them in the future but for now he's been attached.
