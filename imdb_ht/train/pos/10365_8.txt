This is a true story of a WHA australian couple charged with killing when their infant kids disappear. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to maintain our interest even if it plays a character that is not particularly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Madness in media surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard's murder in Ohio for 50 years. These life situations demonstrate that media in reality can affect how a criminal case is handled. I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a headline indicating "Why is not Sam Sheppard jailed?". The prosecutor eventually succumbs to this unprecedented pressure, and Sheppard tried and convicted. Only after years of imprisonment he was exhausted. <br /> I love movies that tell a true story, make it an interesting way and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies that tell stories of innocent people are including "Hurricanes," "Blue Line Lines," and "Breaker Breakers". In particular, the latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
