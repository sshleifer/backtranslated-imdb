Going to see this movie I was a bit uncertain because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little I knew that I was in for a ride in Magic Cinemas. Everything in the movie from the plot of dialogue effect was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire dazzling dancing as the star she is in this movie. From the start of the end you fall more and more in love with this character. Michelle Pfeiffer is ominous as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty. Robert De Niro is a familiar character that gives the audience the biggest sophistication of humor as the film takes momentum towards the highest score. <br /> <br /> In general this was a movie that surprised and loved me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for kids and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.
