"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actors are great - artistic direction is outstanding - the music is magic. It is not supposed to "kill a mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. Stephen Sondhemim's song is stellar: "Return to business" is energetic, "Sooner or later" is just right, "What you can lose" is haunted - even tunes like " Live Alone and Love It "add to the story <br /> Got the likes of the giddily performing on-the-top performers at Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Head, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting bandits ... The list is far too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. Writing with a minute smile (how often we looked at each other, saying, "Wait a minute - I have a thought - it's gone!") .. However, one of the hardest things about in this movie is that everyone involved seems to have a good time - and that above all adds to the fun for the viewer. So, if you have not already, why not give "Dick Tracy" a chance - to accept it for what it is - a comic strip Sunday brought in life - and in a wonderful way !!
