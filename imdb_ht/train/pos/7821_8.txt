Very rarely Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and comes to think of it goes for Kevin Kline and in this case, this must count as one of the best films. It is more about film about how strong friendships can be over the story of Steve Biko although we get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friends Donald Woods went to preserve the Mans name and leave the world know what a corrupt society, South Africa has. The direction is outstanding at David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although there is any criticism to be aimed at being in the film's length. Two and a half hours are a long time to sit in a historical film .What amazing is how it manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before breaking up in Aparthiet, and you can not fail to move it. 8 out of 10.
