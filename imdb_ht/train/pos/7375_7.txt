Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2) but still a good Japanese movie horror nonetheless. I wish American horror producers would take a page from the Japanese horror model, adding more 'spookiness' and less cheap shocks to the flicks. Many good examples of this one, scenes where a whitish face is a scene staring behind a girl actress, pictures on the wall suddenly smile smile, just for a second, and more. Worth check out if you like the genre.
