This movie starts out cold, there are some slow times in the middle, but generally move along well, have a very good moment, then peters from the end of Law 3. I could get to see this first LA times 2 times (with 2 different beginners). Jason Lee is a star, but not a mantra who leads people. It is funny and keeps its own, but it is best served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new to her, but she does not 'steal' this movie, the way a star of her caliber would be. For an actress who has a lot of potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to watch her continue to make the roles so average, and then do not have to take the role and run go with film (like Daniel Day-Lewis made to 'Gang'). Selma Blair is a good young actress as well, and doing a 'ok' job. I did not expect a performance academy award from her, and she did not deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another 'higher average' movie. Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I've done like this movie! But it's not a movie where you walk away and say ... 'That was great!' ... This 'story' has been done many times before and was just not many new here. The scene of rehearsal dinner was probably the best of the movie, and Larry Miller provided an incredible performance in a support role (it could be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have an enjoyable evening, I can always recommend this movie, but unless they have changed the end ... again ... left during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed.
