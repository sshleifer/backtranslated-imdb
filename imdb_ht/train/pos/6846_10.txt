The film gets the stamp of my approval. The scene of the museum requires action without dialogue. This is one of the most exciting and unique scenes in the history of films. Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and his performance has felt throughout the entire movie. The best job of Angie Dickinson has been doing since Blank Point!
