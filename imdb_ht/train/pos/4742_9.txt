This film has more action before opening credits than all of Hollywood's films. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and Jet Jet star. This team has brought you many reliable Hong Kong movie productions, including Once in a Time of China series. The action was fast and furious with amazing wires. I only see the wires in two shots. Aside from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as filler. To find any other movie rival action this you have to look for a Hong Kong movie outlet in your area. They are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint.
