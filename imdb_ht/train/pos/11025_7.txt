Cliffhanger is a decent action adventure crimes and some flaws from director Renny Harlin who admirably to make this film on an expert climber who finds himself taking hostage with a friend friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for full trial cases steal cash from robbers in the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as the Gabe Walker Climber's expert especially in the action / fight sections but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the movie though I want to stop my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respectable as the characters supported by the film. Action / Battle sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some are not very realistic no matter how difficult you are. The clandestine sequences however are very well done because instead of making the entire movie in a studio somewhere where they chose was very real and the Ariel views of the hill chains are nice to add a touch of reality to the movie . Deaths are invented while others are sort of predictable. The villains are solid but it would have been better if they were focusing on a more central instead of having a lot of them. The rhythm of the movie was a little slow, but the good outweighed the bad one of this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or the Stallone than the chances you'll enjoy this one too. Usually Cliffhanger has character development and enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, emotion, and good performance by casting that makes this movie worth the time to look.
