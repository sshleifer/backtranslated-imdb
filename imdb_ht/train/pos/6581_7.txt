Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found the 1985 version that seemed interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very a Ken Russell movie type -quirky, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." Nero was presented not so much as incarnate evil, but as a nasty wacky, unfulfilled who would rather have a circus career. He probably wondered why the earth was put in the "leading" position of an empire - it was not so much fun, and fun is what he longs for. Mary Bandaur's Klaus had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all she was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with a vengeance; one of the many who did that. At one point in one henchmen he murmurs: "No one will ever understand we've simply protected ourselves." He was right.
