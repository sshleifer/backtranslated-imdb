I was 10 years old then this was on TV. Not far from being my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous .... I just ordered the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have super-power. They just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, eyes). The 3 actors were very good at the rolls, very credible. There was a good story in every episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was thought to be good, and the characters were great. There was no fancy stuff, as in other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV to show anyone as good.
