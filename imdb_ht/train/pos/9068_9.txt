I thought the kids in the movie were great. I'm dealing with children in this age group, and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5 year old. I did not think the comment was needed and actually slightly lowered my opinion in the movie. <br /> I think Luke Benward is up and coming star. I would like to see more of him on the big screen. I enjoyed his reaction to situations that he found himself in. Often children in this age group do things without thinking of the consequences. Almost all the actors did this in the movie. <br /> I also think the message of intimidation needs to be examined more in movies with this age group. It's a big problem in schools today. The finish was quite unexpected. Billy's thinking about whether he won or did not win the bet was very surprised. How he cares about this situation was excellent. Too often children today do not want to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
