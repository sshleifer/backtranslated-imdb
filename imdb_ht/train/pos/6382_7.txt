Definitely a very good idea, scenario was just ok.And the best, the positives are that it does not matter if you're an adventure lover, A new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The negatives are that I personally feel that mind This has been much more potential than this. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all but it would have been better with some more runtime. Enjoy it a lot though , Cant says it was boring or not good .. A good for those who love adventure animations like Sindbad, like the way to el Dorado.This film is also recommended for those looking for a lovely little adventure and a very beautiful happy ending.
