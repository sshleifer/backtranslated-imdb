I must say that the events of 9/11 did not hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. I've been one that has changed the station of radio and TV channels if there were any talk about the towers. I was sick of hearing about it. Then this was revealed on TV a year and a day later, I was bawling my eyes out. It was the first time I called since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I watch it now on TV, 5 years later, and I'm still crying about the tragedies. The fact that this one of the only video shots in the first plane hit the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and watch where he got. These brothers made me want to help.
