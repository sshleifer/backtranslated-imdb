CAT SOUP is a short animated based on the legendary Manga Nekojiru. She won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Prize" at the Japan Media Festival. <br /> When Nyaako's heartfelt kitten stolen by death, he and his brother Nyatta embark on a rare journey to get it back. In the surreal dream of the other side, they encounter many fantastic and remarkable characters, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> Cat Soup is an anime as nothing you ever see. It's Hello Kitty About Acid! It is very original, stunningly beautiful and possesses a great sense of strangestity and lyrisism. CAT SOUP is very surealist (no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. So it is more animate for adults than children (they can not understand all!). A great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute ruler. A must-see!
