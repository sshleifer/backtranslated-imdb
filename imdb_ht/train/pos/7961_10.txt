"The Box: The Incredible Voyage" is one of those old old cats on home pets. Destinations somewhere among the great cinemas in its genre and even the movie world in general, along with other cinemas such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it is more than just a movie about pets. Is this perhaps just a "remake"? It is too good to be a "remake"! I know this by heart since my early years (when I was 12). It's a family movie treasure. It's emotional, thrilling, adventurous, fun, fun, funny, charming, sweet, nostalgic, lovely, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. It is one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of people who appreciate this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does not lack quality. It has a well-thought-out history, charming character, excellent and relaxing instrumental bands, dazzling scenery / landscapes in the beautiful Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Speaking of the perspectives, not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... at the conclusion, all wonderful nature is beautiful - truly a full panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are good, well developed and well portrayed by respective actors. Robert Hays is scared like the kind-hearted father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is equally good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as Jamie's youngest and beautiful (her appearance actually reminds me of Kevin Corcoran's "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruped pal, shadow is my favorite. Shadow is loyal, wise, mature, lovely, caring and loving old Retriever Golden (brilliantly voice by Don Ameche). Luckily, the American Bulldog is the opposite of the shadow. It is against, unusual, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and like to play (voiced by Michael J. Fox's talent). Cancer just can not stand still. Sassy is the epitome of the cat's image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical chat attitude but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Point Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field, who also does a good job. Our four-legged friends, themselves, great "actors" by nature: Ben as shadow, Rattler as lucky and tiki as sassy. <br /> It's a musical film, but a classic by its own right. Its end is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on Top 250.
