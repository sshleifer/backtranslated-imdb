One of my favorite movies was neglected by too many movie visitors, a mystifies observation. Not only did Ang Lee Lee, many young actors starred as Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jeriko), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker , Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All the actors were superb and each of the actors mentioned was performing memorable performance, especially Meyers describing a villain who was killed for killing. <br /> <br /> When the biographies and achievements of the principal (even when she won an academy award) and the actors listed, this film is usually omitted in past performances. I discovered the movie on DVD by accident and it became one of the most frequent films I watched. However, it is rarely seen on cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest to why this movie is not well known.
