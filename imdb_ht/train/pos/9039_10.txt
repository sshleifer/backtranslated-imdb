I grew up in South West Virginia; I am about the same age (or maybe in a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of the "Rocket Boy," the book forms the true-story base of this heart-warming movie. So I relate to the term trends in the West Virginia coal-mining, and Sputnik's stunning effect was at that time (4 October 1957) about all of us. The rocket boys went on to make life great for themselves. I went to find my degree in Physics and Computer Engineering. All because sputnik raised a lot of young people in the US Gap of US was on US in the Cold War days ... This is a wonderful movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950's, it will earn the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Find it; look-it; Recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
