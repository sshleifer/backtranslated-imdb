This movie is perfect for all the romantic in the world. Jan Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" strikes close to the house, is nice to look at and lots of fun to play along with. Ben Gazzara was an excellent and easy cast in love with. I'm sure I met Arthur in my trip somewhere. All around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening ..! :-)
