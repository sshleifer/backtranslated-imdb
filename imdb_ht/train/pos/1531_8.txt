Diagnostic Murder has been shown on most everyday day of BBC1 since I used to watch it while being sick a good 10 years ago - I know I should not really enjoy it, in the same way I do not should enjoy 'killing people to read' but I totally addicted to both and even having the DVD-set box .... OK I know this sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke brings the show as her star as Dr.Mark Sloan a Doctor of General Community Hospital in LA who is also a police consultant for the LAPD - her son Steve (Barry van Dyke - the real dick's life) is a police officer, who needs his father's help on so many death suspects. <br /> <br /> Together for the ride is Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) resident of the General Community Pathologist and for the first couple of epic you've got Scott Baio playing DrJack Stewart, who climbs and leaves set In 1995 he hoped to go to bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he had not done anything to score since .... and his only theater appearance for many years was at Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear !!! <br /> <br /> However, Dr.Jack Stewart has been replaced by Little DrJesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter who resigned from Baio's shoes very comfortably. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. (The killings he wrote - everywhere Jessica goes, someone ends up dying, or Mysteries Dowling Fathers mentioned about a murder of the priest and now sidekick) The series was lighter up to 1997 this is because it was a cast support including bumbling Hospital Manager Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci along with Secretary Nurse & Mark Dolores performed by Delores Hall, After 1997 both of these characters were not included yet and the series became a grittier affair with a major budget cap , some episodes were more action, one episodes the entire hospital was blown. This was a family show to Van Dyke because as well as the Dick's son, you also was the Dick's Dick And her grandchildren made an appearance of various episodes. As the series went on it got a bit funny, one episode I remember Dick Van Dike playing all his family, which was a bit out of the ordinary but on 'Diagnosis Kill The Whole 'was a really good TV show that had lots of good Guest Stars. Since this show ends in 2001, Dick & Barry has appeared again in the series 'MURDER 101' on TV Movies made by the Hallmark Channel, pretty much following the same path, and always enjoyable. The dick that's currently in the middle of the 80's does not seem to change a great deal, and looks as if it works until the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** from *** **
