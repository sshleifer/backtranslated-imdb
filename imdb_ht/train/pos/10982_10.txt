I found the gray field is an attractive film, an amazingly intimate look at too much antics that basically have the right idea: forget about the society and live in a Delapide House with no heating and a big <br /> <br /> little of cat and raton, persuading their own interests instead <br /> mundainly, all while chattering in the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are two crazies that the gross Mazles <br /> <br /> was selected in documents. They look like characters from a <br /> <br /> Fellini movie, only stranger, if that makes no sense. Old Edie is <br /> almost completely bedridden, a pile of paper, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> growing up around it. Little Edie is even more interesting. It's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have never seen her hair in the movie, nor we ever get a hint <br /> that she still has a lot. At age eight, though, it is still <br /> beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens, we find that both of these women <br /> <lives have become much less than they were once. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the infamous of the two. While her mother, in her <br /> earlier years, was married, made a family, lived luxurious and the same made some recording (scene scene, in 77, she sings <<br / > along with a recording of "Tea for Two" she's been decades ago is <br /> <br /> one of the best scenes films), Edie leaves her promise as a <br /> <template for take care of her sick mother. At 58, he still craves in <br /> to get her princess charm. If anything Little Edie is still a girl, <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, and in domestic and romantic <br /> <br /> Bliss, which has yet to be fulfilled. /> <br /> Highlights in the movie include the opening moments, where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her outfit in the camera, "was for the two" sequence, <br /> birthday party, The climate argument, the supermarket delivers <br /> <br /> scene, and the scene in the attic. Everything is incredibly <br /> <br /> frank and unpretencious. And it's all the most reminiscent of it since it's all real. <br /> I suggest seeing Gray Gardens back-to-back with the Kenneth <br /> <br /> Short anger then Mom. The DVD Criteria is $ 35.00, but it's <br /> <br /> worth every penny.
