The seven books of the stars will be Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has a motive to meet those who have retired to pay their taxes. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people while driving talking to his phone and the film following his attempts to try and venture for it, quite frankly, unforgivable crime. The story line is as subtle as a brick in a green house window. What you see is exactly what happens - even the end of Titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds. There is absolutely no twist, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is happening. Normally I'm just like Will Smith when in fashion full of boy fashion. The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Hush to Hell" as every time he tries to act seriously only comes across as a pathetic attempt in trying to get an Oscar who he is so obviously is desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I did not look forward to the movie, although here it is very understated. There is flash of comedy but subtle, in fact it was most understated Will Smith performance I've ever seen and for this reason alone it was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award. Throwing in support was all Grand also - Rosario Dawson looked pretty much at the death of the whole movie movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as all other players bit. <br /> <br /> In general it is a joy - but it does not send all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violin to you no other choice but to cry. There was a few times that even my heart stubbornly almost broke. You will be hard pressed by finding one of the situations that are not related to your own life which makes it seem all the more real. <br /> I would give it 8/10. The Smith will show moving on drama without all the despair in the pursuit of happiness and coming to all the best for it.
