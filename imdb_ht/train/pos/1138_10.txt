When I was a kid at 8, I always watched movies and TVs that I was not supposed to, and this was one of them. <br /> It's one of my favorite movies ever, and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the act is excellent, not to make comedies like this Day Anymore These are actually funny movies and make you laugh without resorting to excitement or some kind of vomiting-induced body fluid as in those who delay Judd Apatow movie starts unfunny non-actors like Seth Rogen, Barf). This film is a classic and actor who can actually act, and deserve all hugs.
