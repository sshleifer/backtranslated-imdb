This is a very unusual movie in which the star and top bill does not appear literally until half way in. But I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis, though competent as strongly accused Scott Henderson, seems a little tricky to be sympathetic towards (maybe he should have to razor his whiskers) and his behavior when he first came home should have to convince the cops at least to some degree of innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his painting of the character to be impressive complex. It does not have any bad stock. Superb Character Actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in shape as the 'boy and great ambition.' Her humming in the music numbers added a welcome touch to eroticism. This film however carried by Ella Raines is very capable and comely as the devoted would be the Henderson lover, Carol Richmond. He definitely has talent and his screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of his work I've seen and I'm definitely inclined to see her other role. The rest of the support cast is also more than competent. All in all a mystery movie mystery is very satisfying when they see today completely transmitting the black world and its urban complex is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
