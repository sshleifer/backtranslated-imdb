This led by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon of many film horror fans after he led the hunger instead of the notorious Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find any notoriety as in the movie review here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison with playing more like a Conan inspired outing for a young audience. Immediately wear most fans of all Conan inspired the sword & genre inexperience but before turning your nose up in this, he must say, this movie is just so much fun! <br /> It's mostly played for laughs and features of many heroes and many likable in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. Barber brothers who are both seem to have a ball and their character. B-movie favorite Richard Lynch turned up as the main villain of the piece and it's also great to see the role of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Added to this, the ladies are stunningly seen and decently scantily attractive in all movie duration (a discontinued and very welcome ingredient in the genre!) I can say, - this simply is a really fun and hellhearted take on the genre and I recommend it all hearts!
