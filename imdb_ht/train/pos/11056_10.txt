Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up the 'Baron' and this, a fantasy series of three superhuman spies that preempted the 'Six Million Dollar Man'. It was a favorite to me when I was a youngster, and I love watching it still. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unbearable onscreen screen such as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the appetizing Alexandra Bastedo pouted his way to his role as Sharron Macready. The late Nicholls of Anthony made a beautiful Tremayne gruff. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own 'Interrogation' compares favorably with the 'Prisoner'. I'm sorry that was never a second set; The concept had a lot of life left in it. Are Craig and Richard being competitors for Sharron affection? What if Tremayne learned of the champions' powers? Do the champions have any other capabilities other than what we have seen? We never found out, alas.
