I've only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. They were doing almost 30 years ago I thought the frightening times would be rather to tame. My boy was wrong. There are some great moments that send chivers down my spine. The same act was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb. <br /> <br /> On the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going to be no stop it. It does all the copycats, e.g. Nightmares on Elm Street, screams look very tame. I can not really say it is the best carpenter because I have not seen so much of it, the only salt I can remember in it is Starman (I think he did it). Halloween is the crowning success of the horror genre.
