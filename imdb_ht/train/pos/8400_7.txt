I chose this movie in my local library. Having met the director of a film festival late last year, I was curious to "check out" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. The film takes a fresh look at the subjects that are familiar, love, infidelity, friends, jealousy. It can be a bit 'talky' at times, but never just as completely shed the movie. I liked watching a love story and characters that CLEARLY are doing together and looking to make conscious decisions rather than "falling" falling into something important as love. The contrast between this film and the low-budget-shoot-em 'up black film is quite distinct. Look at that. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the band as I did. Good stuff!
