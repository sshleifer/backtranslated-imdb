Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just welcomed a baby baby, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs daily and soon have Azaria dedicated to God in the churches, and the two older boys look forward to. Michael becomes a vacation and the family decided to head to the Rock Ayer, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. It was not rich, the family camp near the site. After a beautiful first day, Lindy puts the baby Azaria sleeping in one of the tents. Suddenly he heard Azariah weeping. As Lindy rushes into the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head. The baby goes and soon, so the dingo. Although the whole camp looks for the baby, it does not get. Concluding it is dead and that the Dingo did with their dear children, the struggle of Chamberlains to accept God's decision and continue with their lives. But unfortunately, the story has become sensational coverage of the news media and soon the story of Lindy's killing story has killed the baby. He is immediately arrested and put on trial. How did this happen? This is a great illustration of real events showing how "crowd rules" are not a figure of the imagination. The whole country turned against the Chamberlains, partly because they saw it as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever Lindy Complex, which has her own strong-enthusiastic mindset every step of the way. Neill, as well, does a wonderful thing like Michael's reluctant and confused. Throw is one of the greatest ever, and the rhizome of folklore across the country is getting drilled into Lindy's case. Costumes, scenery, script, directions and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard in this movie, this remedy is far away. It is not a far cry from reality saying this "Cry" should be seen by everyone who cares about film and the power misused in the media.
