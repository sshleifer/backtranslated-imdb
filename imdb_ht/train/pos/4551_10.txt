I have never seen an incredible job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown at my Left Foot. In fact in the role scene he was not even about. She has played the role of Christy Brown or at least crippled like her all in filming in the movie and the surgery needed because of the damage her superiority has brought her back. For me that is remarkable and in all the pain he set up and to act that role I believe he is true to say and put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history. It was so mastery of this difficult part that I believe that no one could do it better or with more of an impact than it was. Although I can not say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say how he plays this impossible role and then keeps on acting it until he did not even act is without a The worst feet I'll ever see is an actor. Probably a man too for that matter.
