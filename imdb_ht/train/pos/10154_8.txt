This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen-I have not seen Alias- and I was curious to see if the guy can act. She sure you can and is likable to this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course Gorgeous but it is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found it very good and lovable in this different "sweet" role in a school. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is all the glamor and the story is not true rings of all.Also, though every character in the movie remarks how good to look together, I do not think there are screen screens la. However, I enjoyed this movie. Local residents are beautiful, the characters are likable and goodlooking and the actors are very good. If you're waiting to see a great romance, this is not it. But if you want to see a beautiful innocent movie goodlooking with its interesting characters very good.
