This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school / baseball high school teacher coach, who is inspired by his players to try out for their pros and satisfaction with his life's dreams of playing in the students. Dennis Quaid, no stranger at sports film, plays Morris and is confident that doing the work part and producers perform a credible job in recreating the real events that led to Morris briefing as a relief pitcher for the Tampa Tampa rays Give Devil. The first half of the film, dealing with its bundled floor at High School Baseball players (everyone watched too old at High School) is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall the movie suffers from some rhythm problems and a few extra subplots that we probably could do without. However, it is still a movie that is involved with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pleasure for a reason. GRADE: B-
