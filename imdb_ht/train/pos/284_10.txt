The one and only season has just been revealed here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! All story lines are so good! and it's a much more realistic look at young children and family life today. yet it still holds solid family values ​​in sticking together and having one another. The issues were real, and it really drew you to the show. The show is basically about this family called the 'days' and their lives. The family was born in Abby Day (Maman), Jack Day (Dad), Natalie Day (Daughter Sport), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy son generation). every day's episodes of life, and perspectives on things in all of it. I liked her insight cooper in the show was just great. it was by far my favorite character. he ended up with lots of things he could have been continuing with, I'm really sad another season has not done. it was a great show I'll miss it.
