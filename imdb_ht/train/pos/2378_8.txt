This film is a lot better than the asylum version especially its wars in the worlds. The tripods look pretty cool but the markets and deaths were better. The scene of the action was really cool. Walk ... walk ... walk ... walk !!! oh my gods stop shopping please or i will kill myself. The child's thunder scene was my favorite sequence mostly because a boat rammed bunch of tripods. My good movie recommends it for those who read the book. The music is awesome and the cut directors seem cool. <br /> <br /> Good 99% of the book Victims of Fresh Violence and the Touch Handles Fresh Look at <br /> inconvenience. some bad cheesy acting in London
