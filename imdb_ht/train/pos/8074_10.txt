Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in the 1920s, Ireland, Gypo and fellow fellowmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive Brits. A particular rebel, who wanted to kill by the English, came back to town in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the reward of Â£ 20 proves too tempting. Gypo gets his friends killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drink. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Right away, Gypo, and money burn a hole in his pockets, are the main suspects, but, who his friends, do not want to believe it. The story of the informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easy to get one of John Ford's most emotional films involved. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand its motives. We also understand his sorry character, and there is a lot of sympathy to him. The script is very suspense, as well. It's kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end, so we have our teeth gravel and bring it together. The act is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who has been acting in many of Ford's films, probably has given her best performance here (and won an Oscar for her). Each other performer of the movie deserves it or kudo it. In addition to an amazing script and act, the Informer is one of John Ford's most exemplary films. I love the dark side of Ford. In its humor, as well as in its themes, the Informer reminds me of my two other favorite Ford films, the Long Travel House (1940) and the Fugitive (1948); It's also a bit similar to the grapes of anger (1940) of what they respect. 10/10.
