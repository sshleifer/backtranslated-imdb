It was very low budget (its some scenes seem to be recorded with a home video archive). However it has a good draw line, and its easy to follow. 8 years after her sexually abusive Amanda father was released from the psychiatric psychiatric, with the help of her doctor who secretly had an affair with. The doctor ends up renting him a house and buying him a car. But in the first 20 minutes of the film Amanda killed him and broke it in his yard. Then he sees in his neighbor Richard laying his eyes on it and stopped nothing until he got it. She acts innocent but after another buzz buzz finds that Amanda kills this doctor and tries to kill Laurie's wife Lauren (this is after Amanda and gets her on the hot tub). Then he stopped acting innocent and killed Buzz and later on attempts to kill Richard people he supposedly loves and eager for. And you'll have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. In general good movie, remind me a lot of my life you know all fall for the neighbor and stop at nothing until you have her party.
