In our house we are enormous fans of a Christmas Carol and look virtually every Christmas version, including Old Reginald Owen's 1938 and Patrick Stewart's modern 1999. Our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic, because Alastair Sim is Ebeneezer Scrooge and its conversion to the true ring. However, this 1984 provision has its own unique merit and makes a beautiful and fun story, generally faithful to Dickens' novel. (See my comments on other movie adaptations, if interested) <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and does not make a bad Scrooge. I worship his cap, his longoints & hats. It cuts the finest fashion figure in the lot, and quite a nice gentleman. However, sometimes it looks like Scott is enjoying his role as Scrooge just a bit too weary and does not take it seriously as it should! <br /> <br /> This show has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hope and optimism. Somehow you know this story will have a happy ending. Films in the city of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems to be very British. The film has a beautiful music note, and wonderful, lively caroling music through all the appropriate portions of the story. Sometimes I could almost smell the roasted chanteri and pudding singing in the brass! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady, Christmas Presents beautiful giant and jovial, Christmas but Coming Wrapped and Foreboding as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a little wee quietly & grimaced, not nearly as jolly & hearty as it should. I love the nephew's wife, whom she named Janet, and her beautiful, sprightly hairstyle period. Instead of blind man's man, a game called Similes for Christmas party's dinner party, which is a very attractive touch, Scrooge is getting right in the mind of the thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. Ms. Cratchit is charmingly described by Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott at the beautiful 1970's adaptation of Jane Eyre. Above all, this version has Tim Tim's best-timer, not just an adorable & touching little waist but clumsy. With these black circles under his eyes, the fragile thing seems easy to survive the hour! This is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classical. With its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the season's spirit.
