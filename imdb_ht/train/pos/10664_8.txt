Is anyone else crying to the joy of watching this movie? I love it! One of my top 10 movie ever. It just makes me feel good. I watch the production number closed and all members are thrown over and over and over !!! Babes Benson (Michelle Johnston) is babe in the movie, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get upset when I read reviews that the play was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The film process will rarely deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it is only due to public alienation that many well-known work fits in the screen does not change over them. This is a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
