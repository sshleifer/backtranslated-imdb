I read that Jessie Matthews was approaching and turned out to be co-starring with Fred Astaire in the Distressing Girl. Jessie Matthews in the first place never left her in the pond making any American movie music. If they were associated with this movie, it would be once a life event. <br /> It's a pity because Damsel's Distress has everything else to go for it. Fred Astaire, story and adapted on screen by author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy, and singing by the Gershwin brothers. In response to the questions posed by the Nice job If you can find it, there is not much you could ask for more for this movie. <br /> <br /> Except a leading lady. Even though Ginger Rogers has made several films away from Fred Astaire, Damsel's Distress is the Astaire film only made without Rogers while being a team. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite to Astaire. Her character has no bit of biting that Ginger Rogers's party does in the movies. All it basically made is acting sweet and dull. It also does not contribute to anything musical. But if I had to score all the dancing partners in Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine would come from the bottom. The poor woman is just awful in things looking up numbers. <br /> <br /> When it's co-starred later on in a music with Bing Crosby, the Waltz Emperor, it's not crashing that Fontaine has nothing to do with music .. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a one collar and in this case I think it actually did some good. Idyllic lush green land in P.G. Wodehouse is really carrying out this VHS copy. Especially in the numbers I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine who made place in the field. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troops supplement the grand style Astaire in the Lip Lip Lip number. The sequence of fun-house is wonderful scene. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy runs gamers with Constance Collier at his best friend and once Montagu loves as Fontaine's father as a handsome man on film. <br /> <br /> Bigger hit from a girl in Distress is a Foggy day perhaps best known song on the British capital capital since London Bridge is falling Down. Make in the best simple way elegant by Fred Astaire, it's one of the songs that will hold ever as London's endurance and even after. <br /> <br /> Neglect young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, A ladle of distressing rate as a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classical comedy. Who can ask for more?
