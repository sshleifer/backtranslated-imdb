The Sunshine Boys are one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it when it was Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I've seen it 6 times in theaters, and if he's playing today I would go out to see him again. <br /> Now a lot of comments are here to mention the wonderful performances of driving. Matthew was brilliant, but the misfortune had been nominated for Oscar Osnak Osnak's performance Jack Nicholson's performance at Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cocoa Nest .. Burns won, though Richard Benjamin deserves at least to be nominated The role played in perfection, such as Fritz field audition for commercial boat potatoes. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this movie, the direction of the many melee Herbert Ross Ross previously bring a two person to play, "The Owl and the Pussycat" from the screen and made a movie full of it, doing it again. It opened their play without making them look like a photographic stage playing. It fleashens out The story and the characters. <br /> Here we are 20 minutes in the movie before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tells him about the comedy special.Even though There are dialogues from playing for the first twenty minutes, the sequel itself is totally new. A few years ago I saw in the broadway revival in the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, who was wonderful. But I think Ross and senarist, author of Simon Simon improved on it. It's just a wonderful movie.
