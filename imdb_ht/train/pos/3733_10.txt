I had an uncle who committed suicide after being served in Vietnam because of her mental problems after having returned. So when I saw a part of this movie a night on a pay-for-view channel I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle was going to and felt as he was ready for Vietnam. I went and rented this movie and I must say it is the most heart-wrenching movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way he pulls you in many different emotional directions is something I've never experienced with any other movie. As far as Vietnam movie subjects go, I think it is one of the best, although platoon runs a second close. In addition, I think it's also the best performer Colin Farrell as an actor. I love her in most of her movies, but in this one she was incredible. I gave this rating 10 because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
