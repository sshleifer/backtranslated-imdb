This movie is ok if you like magic action, meeting engagement, and a very tiny scheme! The special decent effects considered this film is from the director of "Horizon Event". The costumes are as something from a mad movie max .One of the soldiers talk, so others tell them what to do.It eventually ends like a great shoot'em up movie and blast all the place. I personally loved Russell best of "tango and cash" "escape from the / New York" and "executive decision". She must see this movie leaving your mind at the door for a movie movie sans movie movie!
