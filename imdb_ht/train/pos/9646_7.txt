There are certainly emotions between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - one based primarily on physical attraction in the beginning. And there is also emotion in the interior-family Mathieu's family to deal with issues of his mother - and how that comes to bring about their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless I'm just too dumb they pick up). Why Mathieu In A Mental Hospital? What leads to the boys' break-up? And back to flattening between present and the past is a little hard to follow at first. It seems like the main reason why rent this film is to enjoy some emotional homoerotic v√©rari, or some nidite males. But as a love story or study character it lacks and is not satisfied.
