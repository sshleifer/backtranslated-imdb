If you are a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it. This seems to be a parody of the Nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason she keeps up is the story back on Freddy. <br /> One thing is always great in nightmare movies are the scene of death. But the death scene was very crappy in this. The visual effects were great and the act was OK but the story back was excellent. Basically Freddy's story comes to complete circle of this. <br /> I've read bad reviews for this but I actually liked this despite its many faults: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's death: the final nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Master of Dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: Warriors are dreaming. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: child of dreams. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This was Freddy completely explained, but that all have. Next on my list of Cravens New Nightmares. <br /> (7/10)
