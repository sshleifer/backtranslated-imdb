Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the part of the action it was not good enough. Well, if you consider it a movie action, this point of view can be quite true as part of this mobile action is not actually interesting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than a single action. The film mostly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and 74 confirmed killing, looked as though he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his dream day in Montana, we can clearly see his dear inside. It was the cruel war with his partner's sacrifice that made Beccket become so-called cold-refreshing. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the contrary, was a new corner, but green, and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane has done well to illustrate the mischief and fears when he first tried to "put a ball into the heart one" (as was Beccket said). What he thought about the suicidal actuall mission was that he could easily accomplish and then he could safely get back and receive the award. These two guys were quite different in their personality and I think the film has successfully shown the difference and impact they had with each other due to the difference in their personality. These snipers against, suspect one another and finally come to an understanding by the communication and what they did to help even to save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one.
