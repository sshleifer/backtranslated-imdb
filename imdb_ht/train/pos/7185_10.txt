Sitting on his front porch porch, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley had put exactly the same size of each item in clothing except hats. Ted, one of the greatest in the cascade people, said that every time Zorro puts on his mask, he was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was a little bit of an exaggeration: There were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in the exhibition we can meet it was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what cascades! "Zorro's Legion Fighting" is, as witnessing the comments here, one of the biggest in series. It is interesting and generally very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a fine actor and, as someone else commented, he did a very good fop. <br /> But admittedly, it is the action that makes this movie so great. <br /> What else could we expect, with direction by excellent team, Witney and English, with great music from the amazingly prolific William Lava (the list here says he has been credited, but the correct ones The other composers listed here were indeed accredited, and I do not know if they wrote any of the music - it sounds like lava), and averti from, among others, great Charles King, and dozens of small party? <br /> <br /> Also remarkable was a cruel play by Tarzan's radio, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar Rice Burroughs' son-in-law. (I encourage you to read her mini-bio.) There is a chapter that slows depressingly things, but, he's only a matter of minutes (maybe 20) and when you walk in it, well, you're back to the excitement. <br /> <br /> Classic Turner Turner deserves great thanks to present this excellent set, and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> /> And we should thank all those involved that we get to see it as a chapter-play, or series, and not as a re-cut feature.
