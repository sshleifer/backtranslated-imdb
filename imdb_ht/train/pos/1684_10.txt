Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% as disturbed as one of this film, well then I guess it might have come out worse. Unfortunately, the video footage of this movie has the scene of the original shot scene by the distributor to boost calls to the photo box office. Several times during Milligan's ugly film camerawork and silent silence suddenly ended, and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligan's house actors took over and start doing it in the 60 psychedelic rock band. It's very easy to fast-forward if you're trying to pay attention to Milligan's original movie, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that has cut room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, is always compelling. I do not think I've ever seen a mother more lovers of any movie before.
