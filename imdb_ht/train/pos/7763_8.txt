One thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and still runs to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of the best performances away from their home studio. Rock Hudson has received these hugs for his performance in Texas-based Giant-based film that Universal Executive has to be thought to be quick to find it in another modern Texas environment. <br /> As well as Robert Stack has received great reviews for the High and the Mighty as the pilot split under the strain to fly a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up too. <br /> Both of these finishes have been achieved in Writing on the Wind. Before Hudson was the Ranch Owner, she is the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words James Dean's party without James Dean racist at Giant. Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that used Stack's Stack Oil. Hudson loves her, but she was weakened by Stack's millions and when she woos a girl she had meant to really pursue a campaign. She is married to Stack. Last but not least in the mix we have Dorothy Malone in the seafood chimney sister with a yen for rock, but Rock is not about to get tangled up with this wild kid. Dorothy Malone has spent more than 10 years of a whole range of colorful movie heroines before landing this gem. She received a better Promoting Committee for her party as Marilee Hadley and she was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like Splashy technicolor fifty opera fate than this is the movie for you.
