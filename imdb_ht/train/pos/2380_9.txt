I did not mind the whole market. People really did walk back then. He borrows a time of justification at this period with a few perspectives on the technology of the Martians. I also was disappointed by the effects, in particular the "Thunderchild" scene, which I considered as one of the most interesting in the book. But I can not praise this movie enough for his loyalty to the Wells story! It's about time. The actors are unmatched and their performance is good. Also this film is very much worth seeing just Jamie Hall's note of really great music. It was interesting to see even the actor playing both the writer and his brother in London.
