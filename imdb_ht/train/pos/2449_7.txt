when I saw ads for what I thought "NO NICK AT NIGHT DONE!" because it took "cool heads" cracks. Well, I still love the cool chef. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how non-stereotype benny is. Carmen is a very good, really funny character to see how stupid and overemotional it can be sometimes. I feel bad for the guy who plays max, it looks very much smaller then it actually is! but max is a fun character, and kindness. And yeah, angie is a bit stereotyped, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a great head! well but it can be really good too. funny shows! It definitely should be more often then improvement in the home.
