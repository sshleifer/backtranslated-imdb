Directed by Flynn's good friend, Raoul Walsh, movie star Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious, egotistic young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the Olympic Exclusive Club in San Francisco in the late 1800s. Though good-natured, the fact that it is a "Irish shanty" and a social climber builds resentment to Olympic Club members; Most of them can not wait to see him lose a fight, and bet against it. Despite this, he got up to fame, even working as an actor. Finally, he gets the chance he's waiting for, a match with the global champion, John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan demanded a deposit of $ 10,000 to ensure that Corbett will appear to fight for $ 25,000 of the suitcase. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) despair for getting the money. However, help comes in the form of a very easy person. <br /> This is a very fun movie, and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. It has the charming, charming and athletic charm for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, her romantic interest that insists she hated her. In real life, it does not seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The focus of the movie is on Corbett and his career rather than the story of boxing. Corbett has used science and innovation techniques and has been thinking of people who have prizefighting an art form. In the movie, Corbett is fleeting and avoiding being hit by his opponents; He believed that he had put John L. Sullivan this way. <br /> <br /> Good movie catch Flynn at the height of her too short time as a superstar.
