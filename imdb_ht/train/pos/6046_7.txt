I was surprised by the film. Let's deal with it; The site does not sound particularly appealing when it comes to over money for a movie flick of the night, but it has a controlled nature that wins one on. There was no time that I found out, and I doubt any I will remember the next day, but that does not weaken as a nice rehab. What I found funny was watching him here in Peking with my Chinese girlfriend who never understood anything I love. I said he had a plot-three guys had to bring back some weeds to London. Hardly satisfied for her. There is no mugging going on here for the camera that I would expect after reading a number of comments. I take exceptions however in comparison with Withnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt it was intended. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
