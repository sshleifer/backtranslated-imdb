You spend most of this two-hour film asking "what's the story about the lead character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a low-key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes are when you get out, and it's a shocking .... but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, playing it mysterious, is almost walking. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it never really explains, once again, keeping us guessing to the end. <br /> <br /> All of this, including an over again / over yet touch romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") might make some viewers frustrated or want to leave this movie ..... Not because the final segment puts all the pieces in this puzzle together. This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed twin Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seen plot, sad to face Smith throughout this story. She almost does not even look like her in a number of shots. It looks like it loses weight and is sick. Smith does a great job that shows a man carrying around a lot of sadness. As a good movie will often do, this movie will let you think long after the credit ends.
