Youth, sexuality, and the French country - one of the most unique films you'll ever see. If you can see it is, no feat wants to consider how difficult it is to find his copy (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It's sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting, and sometimes funny. A boring wasted also in the middle, but all of you can not call yourself an affectionate movie of scary until you've seen this one at least once.
