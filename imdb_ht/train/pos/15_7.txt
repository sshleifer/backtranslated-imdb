I guess if a movie has magic, I do not need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow to others, magic etc. in this movie: the scene of the library. There are many minor defects in Stanley & Iris, but they are not detected from the overall positive impact of watching people helping each other in the life of the most incomprehensible life, the toughest range. Both the smart characters. But Stanley can not understand enough to operate because he can not read; she can not read because she has too much adventure in her childhood. Iris, although well-educated, has not had enough adventure and what they can not understand how to move past the U-turn to life it took. In both the faults and the forces, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working years after years of a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his alphabet enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these "mysteries" explain in the course of the story, the unfolding looks a bit like. I suppose no one takes the time to repeat the script. Even so, it's a good movie ?? just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have made on screen if someone had!
