I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and it was still a favorite of mine. Of course, you can not deny the appeal of Kristofferson in the movie - HOW FINAL is that MAN ???????????? Sheesh. He is always there. It is the bad boy every woman wants secretly. His act is impeccable. He plays a drink / drug only the way someone really went to he could - and it was - at '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all very real. GREAT and though in later years I thought Streisand was a bit not the right person for her in a sense of physical beauty, I think it's more a problem for male viewers than girls. We gals are just looking at Christ - and of course the guys look at the girl's interest - my husband can not watch the b / c movie in it - he does not like it. But I made it sit in just the Ferrari red scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well it was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with it 'and the explosive music - you should have seen it on my 50 plasma WOW !!!! And finally, the quality of the transfer was GREAT - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great colors and noise very low except for dark areas that are normal for all films. > <br /> Bring back some great memories to my mother and I love this movie together, I bought a copy for her for Christmas ... They would like to watch her along with her night yesterday. tried to sit down in the original with Judy Garland, but I guess to see this one first, I just can not get in the earliest era. Watching all of the concerts in the version of '76 was so much like what I had lived in time .. I'm working my way through the Book by Streisand, but it seems only to talk about herself and s ongs, so far her has barely even mentioned Christ or details on the movie scene. His voice sounds ONLY ONLY now as then. <br /> Check it out, if you grew up in the same time as I (born in 1960) you will love it. Wendy
