Exploring an all-stars throw is so impressive that it almost seems like the "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" in horror pictures, "The Sentinel" (1977) is indeed a movie effectively creeping center on the relatively unknown actor Cristina Raines. In this one, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves to a Brownstone Heights brownstone which is (and I do not think I give too much of that late date) very close to the gate of hell. And as a tenant in this building, he suffered conditions beyond the practice of plumbing and occasional bugwater, to put it lightly! Indeed, the scene at which Alison encounters his brother's upstairs neighbors is really terrifying, and should certainly send the iceberg water that shed down the spines of most viewers. Despite many criticisms about acting acting, I thought it was just fine, more than ably kept his own in scene with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture builds in an effectively hideous conclusion, and although some draw points go unreasonably, I left feeling more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" puts it, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can not be all bad"! On a side note, yesterday I walked over 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at the Sentinel House. Yes, she's still there, and although tearing into her heavy ivy dress and missing a blind priest in the top floor window, looks great as she did in this picture. If this house really is located on hell, I take it that hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But our New Yorkers know this for some time!
