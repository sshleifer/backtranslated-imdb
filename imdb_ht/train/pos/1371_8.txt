This film is a beautiful look, light heartweight in both sides of the "kid's club" scene divided by New York Art, music and world performing arts (and a comedy by the Miss Hunny Bunny). This is "Torch Song Trilogy" for girls in detail-post-teenagers. "That girl" for defective, affects millions of times. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and funny, and the suitcase Parker Posey deserves - if not a premium academy, at least - a "wave" stadium in Kudo. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie rests on the platforms are very stylish in Miss Posey, and it is perfectly thrown. Like a lot of work it acts, it can not be very deep, it is often self-referential, and, well, posey ... but it all works. He is a talented comedy, an incredible artist, and this movie is amused, and brings it on his shoulder like a wool leopard wrap, and never leaves it in the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a fashionista superhero party who is not above dress robot designer from a friend's closet or make out with someone else's boyfriend. At a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends with less care in every sense the word, including others; and the learning process that takes needed care in life. <br /> <br /> The script is very well-crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappears is the Aunt, in a role that was too one dimension and heavy release; a more nuanced performance in it, would have to deepen the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is comedy. An amazing deep abyss, which gives this film some substance and vision world, is the companion sold in fallafel. We all should be so lucky ... is it one for Mary? or the one that gets away? <br /> I miss this as an 8 because it is not a great moment in movie history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richest to re-look) . Like "desperately seeking Susan" it represents something very true about its time, but it may become irrelevant and time-consuming. Still, she has everything an entertaining movie needs, and she's worth seeing several times for the clothes alone!
