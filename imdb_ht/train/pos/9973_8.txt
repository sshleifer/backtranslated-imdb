I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the version of 1971. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up with a movie some time (as I did with the 1971 version) than me, it is not all that great. Of course, this might be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was carried out. However, I saw many remakes, where I loved the original and the best one one. I found that the plot of versions in 1997 was much more comprehensible and fundamentally maintaining the original true without weakening the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "blaze". (Raz)
