While being filmed at a Florida National Guard site, "Tigerland" totally reminds me of Fort Polk, LA., Tire Chains, Maneuvering Area, Water-Deep Water and All. The film was fairly authentic and the characters resembled the same ones in my AIT in 1974. The difference between the year Tigerland, 1971, and me in 1974 is all the drill syllables and instructors knew they did not. going back to Vietnam, as it was pretty much all over, so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. That was the precursor to all our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004. I never heard someone mention "Tigerland" but the Army had realistic village villagers in different bases across the United States Veterinarian Vietnam told me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT could be very rough and rugged, because the coaches were there and were required to train Vietnam-bound male skills to make it, still the case. Both a sergeant exercise at Polk and later one of Vietnam's VET NCOs, when we became an instructor in a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready with those just wanted to know and figure out for themselves. This film is high.
