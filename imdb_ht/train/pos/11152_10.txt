Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass of acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too small to look at it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it was absolutely standing the test of time, and I watched it several times since. <br /> All things on this movie are brilliant, from the toughest performances from Voight and Hoffman (though I know this movie well, I still get myself welling up whenever Voight shines one of the looks innocently pained He, or Hoffman cough in his sick and threatening manner in the stunning and superbly dreamy sequence of dreams. <br /> It is a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to take a risk of making movies As visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight Cowboy should have to look at all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
