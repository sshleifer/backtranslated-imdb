When I sat down to watch 'Largo Winch' I hope there is nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both of these; and more. Karl Roden was finally not the antagonist of a movie, starting with. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role well, but the two real stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both acting superbly. In Radivoje Bukvic described Goran well. <br /> <br /> Linguistic mixes have brought a beautiful color to the movie, but I understand why people would get bored with it .. The landscape in Hong Kong and especially stunning Croatian seaside to both my wonder, and I Hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo went into the island unbelievably beautiful. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine - car type; this is the movie. It is also a movie for those who love action sequences, good acting, extreme beauty scenery, and above all, a fast - paced, well - filmed film, and dazzling combat with a drama fine drama drama. /> My vote, as he outlined a gloomy day is: 10/10
