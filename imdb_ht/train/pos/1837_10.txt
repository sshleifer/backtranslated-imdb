Simply big movie is no doubt about it. Huge history and superb performance, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. Independent film industry will be cynical with Mallika and Co, this film is totally vulgarite free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addiction to our American society. But the message and concept of this film are absolutely superb. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could be avoided with Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as musician. I think Vipul Shah should give little Gujarati to touch particularly in music too. Anu Malik is the worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where attendance is required-It seems only good and Govinda style songs. I felt some nice music and the good Ghazals couple or sad songs could make this movie more memorable.
