I have no fans in the movies yet, but this one was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children can watch it together - how amazing! Aunt I like it, too. It has laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a pale parrot. He reminds me of a favorite, Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent jealousy, separates from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and deception, always keeping in mind his resolve to find his friends, Marie. Very recommended.
