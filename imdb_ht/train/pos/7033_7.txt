First of all, DO NOT call this a remake of the movie '63. Though this version is worst in the stage play, it is very long. The casting was good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. He was nearly 30 when he made this movie, and it was hard to believe he was a teenager. Jason Alexander was the right choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overdoes her party as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee, and he showed he could even hold a tune. Like the movie '63, they cast an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch has fun with his role as Birdie and has shown. I even have the band and I love listening to his songs. So what did this a flop TV review? It was long for one. They put in new songs and scenes. Though some of the new songs were good (such as "Let's settle down"), was it really necessary? Now, do not get me wrong, I love it, but I prefer to watch the movie '63 (see my review). This was just a case of some actors too much role, making some changes, and once again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. He does a great job with the role and music. Give him any lyrics and can sing them. So here is my advice coming from someone who did a couple production to Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch a fun on the play, watch the movie '63. If you want to watch a tough version of the play, watch the version '95. Just take it to moderation though. Do not make a hero and try to look it all in one sitting.
