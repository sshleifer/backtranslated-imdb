This movie was great! It was an excellent pronouncement of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no songs. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magic. It was a different level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the landscape. The music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie. This was definitely not a movie that needs the characters of the song bubble. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
