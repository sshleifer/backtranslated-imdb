The story of a drifter, his sheep ranch sheep, and the princess's daughter is not for all tastes, but it's still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, amongst the scenery we have come to know well in other films in this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I ever saw Mary's excellent Regan, and I was a fan of nude ever since. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes a turn as the hired owner pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Power, and unforgettable performance breakage out of all its drive. The first time I saw this movie in highly modified form on late night TV here in America, but to believe you, the inexplicable version is not to be missed.
