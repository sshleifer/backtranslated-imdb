"Cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, in the Romanian Anamimul movie last year, which reached the third edition and took place in the Danube Delta. This year's price route went to Jafar Panahi's "Offside". I saw it tonight in Bucharest in the retrospective festival. Cinema is dead but still alive. Panahi's film says in a compelling way how Iranian society looks like. Digitally filmed, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real life event that happened to Panahi's daughter: The problem and the risks taken when deciding to go to a football match. This is forbidden in Iran as we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is to acquire and mean some, but and, probably, a lot of work, intelligence and humor to the cultural models of a society that puts women at a different level. Absorption of the laws becomes comical. The film has a happy end, after all because Iran's team goes to the World Cup. What I appreciate most was the concept, the idea behind this movie. I would be very much interested in seeing Panahi's other films being banned in Iran too. I guess he can think of an activist director.
