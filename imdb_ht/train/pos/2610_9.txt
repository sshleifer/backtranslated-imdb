In the ten years since Wildside revealed, nothing has really come close to its quality of local production. This includes the two sets of enjoyable, but Surbel Survival, which brought into life events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The Miniseries Blue Assassin (which also played Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is now being repeated late at night on the ABC. Having not watched the show in quite a while, I still impressed by its line of compromise history and many human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a haunting detective by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who is later tuned to Martin in real life) as a community worker fighting alcohol, and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop who There is gambling. The good equivalent role given by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself), and a young Abbie Cornish. ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple of years ago. The logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me, but I guess it can have something to do with disconnected licenses and original producers. <br /> A great series of remarkably good ages. Here's hoping the ABC DVD storage becomes its act together. <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC message board, some sort of more DVD release is due in December 2009)
