At first I did not like it so much, although I did. They did not include the third generation Trueba, love between Blanca and Pedro wans't explained and some actors were too different from what I was imagining. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that the movie was more loyal to the book, it would be like five hours, and would be kind of tedious. Now I love it very much, because my favorite characters are there as I portray them. Clara really looks like an angel of life, and her introduction to the story of Beggining in the film was fantastic, loyal and short. Glen Lock is Ferula. I imagine it just like that, just not in the mourning of all the stuff. Esteban will get enough. I never really loved his character, and, although I was interested in him, I hated him so much, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the very last part is one of the most exciting, and has real story too. The movie is really good, especially considering it was a Gringo movie based on a Latin American book. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, do you think so?
