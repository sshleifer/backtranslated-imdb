In Holland a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. She stayed overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and she had sex with her (not to imagine she is a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but to look at a picture of Herman Herman's boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decided to stay there for a try. Then things get strange. A great X-rated home art hit in the US in 1983. Why was X rated? Let's see ... there is strangulation, full of male and female nudity, quarrel, mutilation, sex simulation, a scene of a church that has a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and it's all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for her sexual extremity and denounced as garbage. So Verhoeven filled this movie with symbols very obvious think critics would have thought it was art and praised it. It was good! Critics liked the film not to realize that Verhoeven played a big joke on them. Still, it's a great movie. <br /> It's beautifully shot by John Bont (now a director himself) and there's symbolic and obvious "hidden" layers of the dialog that you're never bored. All the acting is great - Crab plays a very despicable character but (somehow) has your rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and play her part of perfection - the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is incredibly beautiful with a great body - she deserves credit for making the church's sequence and going in with the crypt of the crypt. This is not for easy people to quit or weak at heart, but if you love extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way.
