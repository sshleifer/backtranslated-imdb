The makers of this fine film did a terrific job in getting you involved with the characters, as they suffer from the terrible moment.The awesome scene in the woods is doing so superbly that you forget that the man they were just actors, playing parts.I never got so bathed in a movie as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight had never been better on screen, as well as fine performance by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and even if it appeared only briefly, James Dickey, the author's author of the movie based on the film, as the sheriff of Aintry. It's a bit disturbing, with children, at course, should be coated from it, but this is great, dramatic movie.
