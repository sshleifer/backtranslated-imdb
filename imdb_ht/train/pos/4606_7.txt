Police history is arguably one of the best works by owners of action itself. Comparing to other action films, police history makes Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like beginners.The staged scenes are quite cheergraphed and the action scenes are superb. If New Cinema Lines have any sense, they would be released in the theater.
