Visual creative season in inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film can be no most dramaturgy of the alternative or the most artistic act. But who says to this movie is not art? I'm not a supporter of the idea, that a movie is important to be reliable, non-commercial or harassed with questions. Even there are many films, the attribute of this attribute, that I love. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey, for sure, is not one of this movie. What you get is much, too much creativity and a very positive charge, child energy. This film does not reflect reality. Friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the future world described by Rufus - for me it would be a very nice time-place combination to live in! Except of that music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I still love the movie and the scenery of this movie. Especially at this point Bogus Travel head prequel it's not far. Also the effects are good, and I think most of them are very bloody cgi. I generally prefer the good old effects of big budget movies. Make sure 'just another movie Hollywood' from some people watch. But I think it is this in a very charisma way. A short word in the soundtrack: The band and orchestra music fits perfectly into the movie. Also the sound design has no shortage. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I've got to get this track from the scene 'build' to build the bill and Ted robots in the wind. I love the Organic camera work at the start of it. <br /> <br /> Let me finish saying this: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very imaginative! It is a much better way than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - Wrath God. It is absolutely superior to citizens Kane, Apocalypse now or chris makers sans soleil ... ... it is even better than Total Recall ... No way! Yes way! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted in Travel Bogus are simply the best movie ever to do. <br /> <br /> PS: part 1 is not to make himself guilty of "artsie-fartsy behavior" or like Terminator Salvation (what is the biggest defamation of oneself) the best movie. So, Bogus Jorney is a superior end. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior end! DO NOT read it!
