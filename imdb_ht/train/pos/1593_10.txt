The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being one of younger has some teenage problems on her other sister's siblings, she has jobs, boyfriends, fiance problems like most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other sometimes by mistake but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priority in life. I liked this show very much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I always watch the time reruns of time :) Amanda Bynes very talented. Jenny Garth can be new to comedy but she plays really well. She is one of the actresses I love watching. I love Vince and Holly's relationships are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time she shows up. With Tina Holly find a real friend and I really love to hang out. Lauren character is so funny and it is a natural talent. I would like to see him more. Show this really to take you in and make you laugh. I wish the show was not over.
