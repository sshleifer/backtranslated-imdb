Greet again from the darkness. How unusual it is for a movie to examine the soul lost in the person's pain. Adam Sandler star as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy 9/11, and has since lost his career, the reason he is living and arguing, his sanity. Don Cheadle co-star as the former Sandler dancer who appears to have perfect life (Sandler apparently had before 9/11). In the parallel course of life these people are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see the male's mood on display in a movie ... other feelings than lust and revenge, that is. See how they actually help one another by just being painful and sincere. Writer / Director Mike Binder ("The Head of Wrath", with Sandler's account of this movie) really brings a different look and feel to the movie. Some of the performers do not work as well as others, but in general it is well written and firmly directed. Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character recalls a bit of fine performance in "Punch Love Drink," but here it carries much more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a great job to express her burden ... just by watching her work a top puzzle. Supporting excellent work by Jada Pinkett Smith (like Cheadle's wife), Tyler's book (as a very patient psychiatrist), Safran Burrows and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Inside Sandler's Law. how the tragic events of that day affect one person so deeply that it is fundamentally ruined. Besides the exciting story with some great NYC shots, you have to love any movie that features charts from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder imitate Daltrey. It's not exactly a movie optimistic chip, but it's a quality film and a strange story.
