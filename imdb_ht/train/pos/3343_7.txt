My daughter gets really put out of me when I refer to Drew Barrymore as if she'd hit the face with a frying pan, not to mention chin Dudley chin that Jay Leno would die for. How wonderful, then, when I discovered the "Ready Fix" that I really love Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet, comedy light. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will love the movie for her boyfriend's charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will love it for all men's bonds and the deposition of sports mania. wife, my young daughter, and i all find something to love in the movie. It says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half or so, and is probably a really great date cops, too.
