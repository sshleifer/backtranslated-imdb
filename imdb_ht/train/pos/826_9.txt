I'm sick of those who blink on Ewoks! True, they are not the best things that happened in Star Wars, but they came, so deal with it! In addition, they are beautiful, and I do not care if they're merchandise. Yub Nub! <br /> This movie still leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited about the Phantom threat because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke Anakin. I love how it is revealed in the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So, those of us who complain that the Vader helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hides behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. It is not entirely machine - it's vulnerable. <br /> I do not know how the casting director got to choose those good actors in a New Hope. They all do well. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job and develops his dramatic character. Fisher did a great job of being a female role model (I mean, come on! He killed Jabba even though many others failed!). Harrison Ford - Do I Need More? <br /> <br /> The music is once again brilliant. It is so much touching and important when you can choose out character theme from different parts of the movie. The bigger point is when Luke speaks "NOOO!" and jumping out to fight his father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Already, the movie has more meaning for me because of episode I. I can not wait to finally see it in the theaters (I CAN wait ...) and then watch the original trilogy again. <br /> Bravo!
