Womans Waiting Ward at a large hospital in the hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE is. <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a good little soap opera, replete with comedy and tragedy, all tied to the lives of maternity staff and patients. The franchise with which the subjects occupy points up the pre-code film situation. <br /> <br /> Marvelous Aline MacMahon, as the senatorial head nurse, is the calm smell of the movie, the rock where all streams flow. Can handle any crisis or emergency, it is best to mothers, sometimes last, friends. The surrounding MacMahon is a savvy of excellent costumes: Loretta Young as a convicted assailant released from prison time enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her husband fears her; brilliant Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates the kids; sweet Clara Blandick as a mature mother in her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as thoughtful, compassionate physician with Frank McHugh as a comic fraternal-to-be. <br /> <br /> Mav movie will recognize Bob Watson as a Wicked Witch who wants to see the Stork; Paul fixes as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a little soldier; Gilbert Roland as a distressed Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty doctor's wife who is interested in adopting Farrell's son - all uncredited. <br /> There are some absurdities in the scheme - some of the moms are obviously too old; Farrell gets drunk to the Ward but none of the staff seems to notice; An obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this really only improves the original entertainment value of the movie and keeps things from getting too serious.
