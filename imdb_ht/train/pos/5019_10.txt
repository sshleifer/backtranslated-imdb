Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw this movie: 'For the first time,' and Corin Corky Nemec. It was Micheal and Mary Margaret's story. I need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in Micheal's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In Italy this movie has not been scheduled for many years and I do not know how to find the song. A lot of thanks for who can help me! I like this movie! It's very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I like Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
