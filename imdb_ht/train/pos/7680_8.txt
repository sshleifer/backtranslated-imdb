"Holly" is a problem-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sensitive. In her heart it is a character-driven film, which should not be so unmistakably successful from Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul and the awakening awakening gradually, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), strong-willed , but ultimately on-match Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant and effective correction sites, everything is immediately and well done. The classic classic note can put some of the first, but it is the top-notch composition and ensures the admirable constraints that are evident at all. This film, which raises many issues, but gives some clear-cut answers, finally succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and many people sharing his combat. Kudos gives people who managed to get it done.
