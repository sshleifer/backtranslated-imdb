Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-stars in the "Mystery of Mr. Williams," a 1939 mystery / comedy of good, although forgotten, probably due to the incredible number of films from 1939. Douglas plays a talented police detective married her work, while her lover waits for a marriage that is still postponed. What happened in this movie is no exception - she's called a murder scene as she's walking down the go again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent in comedy, worked together well (and often) and helped make this fight in the sex pleasures. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are in excellent support. As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not do much to a woman. <br /> <br /> Interestingly if a little on the long side. <br /> One of the comments here is trashed by Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally drifted easily into dozens of films like the other person and the best friend before coming to his own movie as an old man. She was not lazy, but rather a very difficult-working actor (who made it look easy) who had a Broadway career along with her film career. She just did not throw as a man who led to film or gave very interesting roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performance in "Hud" and "I never sing for my Father" and call it lazy or refer to his smirk.
