I liked Long Way Round and did not even know Ras Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little 'hmm this will be as good' first episode I decided that it was. Charlie Boorman was great as being the other members of the crew. Great to see him with Ewan again. There was a fair bit of swearing in it but that did not bother me. As for being not mentioned in it on the package. This is more done with the comic snippet from BBFC's classification certificate. It should be given a 15 just for the language alone. <br /> <br /> Very recommended set, I want more !!
