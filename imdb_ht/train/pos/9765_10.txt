I saw this jolly little movie at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know he was in a theater at all. To evaluate it from a childhood point I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, because of being a boy at the time, it seemed a little "effeminate". <br /> <br /> The climactic scene where Gazooks dog daylights from everyone was somewhat disturbing at the time but you outgrow the sort of thing. <br /> <br /> When I re-discovering a blockbuster video in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still love it despite the fact that it looks a bit "old". I do not know where the other review about here has got the idea that it was not about VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. Could even be on DVD by now, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my kids one day! 10 stars over here, it's still a great kids movie. (end) <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally get a VHS copy !! Woo-hoo!
