First of all for this movie I just have a word: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best films that touches me, from his story of his performance, so beautifully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with this one last, because it really brings the depth to the character, as it was a very difficult task. Still, the two of them formed a fear, which surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showing off the way a friendship filled with love, which developed throughout the day, remains in the movie. The story takes some time to roll, as the introduction of the characters is time, but finally we're rewarding with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have the chance to see it, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for a lot of time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
