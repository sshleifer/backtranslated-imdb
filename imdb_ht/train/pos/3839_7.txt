Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But long before it was churning out generic exercises in his native land. The story is a fundamental female femme, nothing new or fun. Verhoeven think he can do it best by adding in a series of sequel to dreams, which instead of defining our main characters and his situation, are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable scheme. Simply being solid, the dialogue helps to pad the effects of the affable story. What really made the movie at least good was some terrific acting. Jereone Crab was amazing as the "tortured artist", and the supporters were pretty good as well. Also, John Bont's movies add at least some life into the movie, helping make Verhoeven look at least as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * 1/2 / * * * *
