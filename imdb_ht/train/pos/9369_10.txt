This film is proof that film noir is a durable style, and very worthy to stay alive. For me, it is the best example of the movie noir since Chinatown. <br /> It will, unfortunately, never get the gratitude it deserves. He was never encouraged when he was first released and had to build his quadrant of fans of venues such as Vanguard Cinema and words of reference cows for rental. <br /> I highly recommend those looking for something more than stupid entertainment to rent this movie and delved into its very sad plot.
