"Gandhi as a husband and dad?" has always been discussed by people in India. 'Gandhi ... my dad' is a story that only a few would have known these details. Surely an insight into Gandhi's personal life. <br /> In general, I liked the movie for history and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna, and Shefali Shah all do a great job. Most scenes in the movie should be nice desktop desktop ... lazy job. Traditional American folk music as background scores while some parts of the film give a good sense of what's happening. <br /> However, what I did not quite like was the narration style. At various points, I found the tone over-dramatized. <br /> Overall, good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-look-once". 8/10
