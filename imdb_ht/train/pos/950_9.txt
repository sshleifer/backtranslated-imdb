The environment and actors make this movie for my best performance story Dickens. George C. Scott is very credible as is the rest of the cast. She scrooge oozes and humiliation until the very end of the movie. Then his character changed to one who truly repented. The 19th-Century English city chooses for the environment to create an ambience that is fitting Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this movie. It's a movie I watch every Christmas together with the real Grinch and It's a wonderful life.
