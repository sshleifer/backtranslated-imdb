An excellent set, mastery act and directing, but unloved (I said) by Mr Deighton and removed by him after a single presentation. It is now only visible in private collection, and via the British Film Institute in special request. Very unfortunate, as the nuance chairman Ian Holm's weary-but determined Bernard Samson is superb; one of his very best performances. Throw in support, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are superb. With Mel Martin playing wife in conflict with insidious, and Michael Degen as Werner's mercurial, the story positively simmers and the tragic and decisive consequences of personal in the big game.
