What a perfect example of "Less is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt Todd) has only 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a challenge! As a black and white picture, when your mind's eyes are filled in empty spaces, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gestures, all combine to make a stronger impact. This is one of those five movies I can not live without, right up with the classic as Road Warriors. If you liked this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" both starring Mel Gibson. Also, "Gladiators" and Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen were also soldiers. The "Third Warrior" begins Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" begins Harrison Ford.
