I think you should come from the USA to get a lot of jokes. And if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, You would like this movie. You can not compare the quality of the filming of those of course, but the cameraman tour was obviously made on purpose. Tomato killer is one hundred times better than Neapolitan Dinamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this movie is not for a global hearing. And while I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing at the entire movie. Where I and my jaw were hurt at the end of the movie.
