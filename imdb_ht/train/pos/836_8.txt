This will not be able to vote better comedy of the year, a few too coincidences and draws holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread seller come in love for a few hoodies should not come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in that role, going James Bond's wooden (a role he's wasted). If it can hold this type I hope it continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's right man. I have read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought it was quite good as a lousy housewife with a black side buried deep. There are many chuckles like Brosnan sleazy her way through with a few scenes where I almost died laughing. My father (one consultant) almost lost it when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". Much like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another comedy hit-man, the humor can be very dark. If you are in that be prepared to enjoy yourself.
