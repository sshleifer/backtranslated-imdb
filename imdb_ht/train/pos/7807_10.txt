The performance of each actress and actress (in the movie) are excellent NATURAL which is what acting movie should be; And the direct skill is so brilliantly handled on every detail that I never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, Attenborough's creditors who are my patience: they are not proud of making a claim that they have made these excellent, long-lasting films for the audience? I hope I'd get some answers to my patience from one (maybe one of the "insightful" personal (personal) films of the movie.
