I was born in 1982. Most of my children's memory are in extreme late 80's and 90's. I watched the Tube Groove for the first time in 2001, when I was 19. <br /> <br /> And I found it hilarious. So, for anyone who thinks that something "dates" can not be quite funny 30 years later .... think again! It's funny though you have no idea what the 70 was like, and thought of the bell-bottom pants to make you cringe. Who can argue with a Bozo type of sort that reads adult literature? There's plenty to laugh at. The scrotal married show at the end is the best.
