I thought Baseketball was one of the most fervent films I've ever seen! It's witty humor to make me giggle all the way through, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so on the top, reinforcing the movie comedy. <br /> I've just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it. I have a very short span of attention and I think that this movie has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained at all. The funny quotes are memorable, and they can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later .. so in general I think Baseketball is brilliant movie that everyone should go view, especially if you're less like me 'as it will keep you laughing for a long time later. <br /> <br /> No one thinks it is weird to love them both? hehe
