Without one of my favorites, this good for being a change in pace ... though only for a few minutes. It all starts with a great battle between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is renamed "Butch" here). They are all beating one another, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops fighting and suggests that they all should be friends. So, all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends ... that will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life. The relationship goes nothing but excellent, until a very large installment appears and they all become greedy. Three are guilty of returning to their normal struggle with their rivalry. But still ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a delightful and grateful experience, though only temporary. <br /> Oh, by the way, as a curious fact, two songs from the "Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental version: "We are off to see the Wizard" and "Somewhere on the rainbow ".
