MANMAN FOURTH (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). A movie based on a novel by Gerard Reve, who works best as a thriller. This is very surprising, considering Reve roughly needing a bloody page for just a twist to draw minor and tense is the last thing about my mind when it works. <br /> <br /> The "Four Man" is head-heavy on symbols. Paul Verhoeven is generally very preoccupied and proving something to be especially hostile criticisms and I never make sure he's exactly trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in a reckless way, he quickly diverted to the original idea or scenario, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In the "Four Man" it is not as explicit about the detailed scheme as it is with sex and naked (in which there are many), but, as in most of its films, it seems scary the audience would not find read and hammer the story's story with awareness symbols mix with some alleged black alleged and graphic scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or full-face naked, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it weakens an otherwise good story. But when you can deal with Satiric Verhoeven's beautiful approach, it is quite a fun comedy at times and some intriguing draw twists and good rounds, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© in particular. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
