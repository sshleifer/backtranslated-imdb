The first thing first, I was never once scared of this disgusting mekonet as a kid ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). As my title says this was one of my movies that I still love as a teenager. It's a nice, bitter movie about a misunderstanding German Shepherd called Charlie (fantasticaly voice by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss / partner of crime (is not ha ha ha ha Carface). Charlie is sent straight to the sky by default because "all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, the dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind". Chalie has come back to Earth's cause he has reversed his life clock where he gets to even more misfortune with his best friend, scratching with a little orphan girl, Anne-Marie. I used to watch this all the time as a kid and I still watch her. Anyways, it's a pretty bitter movie as I said before that could just let you tear your eyes.
