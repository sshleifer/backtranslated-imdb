The name of this film alone makes me want to see just what he's all about, so I've stuck this movie during the early hours of the AM. If you ever wanted to see what minor was going on during the early days and actually saw a dramatic scene when I was hailing from the guys. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after WW I and how Germany has helped the minors to French many of the disbelief of the French townspeople. The actors were all outstanding, and strange scenes in the mine with a horse and a little boy who worked at the mine. There is a old old miner retreating that goes down my go by ladder when the elevator breaks down. If you are a real movie movie, this is a movie you will not want to miss.
