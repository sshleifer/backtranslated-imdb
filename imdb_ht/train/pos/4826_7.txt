This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her teens and her first few years as the monarch in Britain. <br /> <br /> The "Young Victoria" has amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated with details of imaccat. The morning costumes, prodigious places and beautiful landscaped gardens make the "Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most surprised at the thoughtful movie. How each person puts in relation to the background or the first thought plans outdoors, each scene is well composed. The scene that hit me most was when Victoria talked to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from the angle of Victoria, while from the angle of Melbourne Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne was holding his arms on his hips. <br /> <br /> History is wise, it is far compressed to be followed and understood by a historic person at Queen Victoria. Many events are running or they do not even explain. I was expecting a grand scene of the ration, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that the events could be well explained without hurrying.
