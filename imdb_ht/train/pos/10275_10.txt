Get ready for it: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm relatively unaware of the David Mamet (writer and director) other work, but after watching this film half a dozen times (it's still a joy to look), I can say without hesitation that it's a genius. This film is very well written, and quickly draws you in its midge of trumpet, con-artistic and rear room. The feeling of the movie is very similar to the Sting (1973) and also pays homage to the movie Noir. <br /> It's quite a psychological film complex and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters. It is a bit predictable at times but the shocking climate is always interesting to watch .. Generally, the act is superb-especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I watch the movie and noticing me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a gambling, a smoker and a thief, but also sports a fake 80's hairstyle. I agree, but I think it is nevertheless exceptional in the role. Less that you know about the plot of this movie, the better, just like Mamet's most recent movie, the Spanish captive, because the finish will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be prepared to take a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to shine.
