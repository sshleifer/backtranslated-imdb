I love this movie so much I watch it over and over. I do not see why anyone would think that this film was not good. Maybe you've seen better or whatever I personally like. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It might be a little like "Pretty Woman" but I have not seen it and I do not think it's any better than this. I do not know why you are all trashing on it, but maybe you have a good reason but I think I've said it enough but I absolutely love this movie, and people say it's not good at all then i ask why you watch it and what movies you think good. As for everyone else I watch it and enjoy it too so it surprises me that this many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that as you spell his last name) it is pretty much with my favorite actress ever!
