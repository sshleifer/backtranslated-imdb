This has a good story ... it has a nice speed and all the characters develop cool. <br /> I've watched a whole bunch of movies in the past two weeks and this had to be the best one I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was the best though. <br /> Even though it was small, it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning. /> <br /> This can be a romantic comedy and I do not like most, but the writing, direction, sound, sound, overall design of all just just been thought out really cool. This movie scored very high from the movie I've seen lately - and the rest was great budget or better to publish. <br /> Good work written.
