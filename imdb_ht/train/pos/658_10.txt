It is not an easy movie to watch - it is more than three and a half hours long and is composed entirely in conversation. But it is so incredibly compelling and gracious observation of the human character, that it is, in humble opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something relieved, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic cello and Julie Go Boating, which were made around the same time). It shows idealism in the late 1960s should not have anything different from the society that he tries to change. <br /> It involves the release of an Alexandre-Marie-Andr√©-Leuud (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). But Alexandre shows them as chauvinistic and jealous as anyone else. Women are exposed as being subservient and defining the femininity of men's gaze. This film is a very pretty end of the very revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most important movements in film history and had a profound effect on movies as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors in the New Wave, having starred (among other films) influenced by Les Quatres Cent Coupe (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebel teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but it should. <br /> No improvisation (unlike the similar movie John Cassavetes made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experience. For example, Francoise Lebrun was an old guy in Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real life of Mary's character based on, also performed. The anger and bitter all come in a harrowing monolith by Veronika released directly to the audience, breaking down the cold nature of the goal of the rest of the movie. This fascinating, personal, and honest filipino statement remains one of the most revealing films in human nature around.
