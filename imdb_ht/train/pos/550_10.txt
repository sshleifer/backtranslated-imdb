This is like a fantastic movie, a west of a self-concerned man (Jimmy Stewart) goes up to the Klondike for gold. On the road, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a pretty good performance), whom he hassles back. McIntire threatens that he will be a dead person if he ever comes back to his hometown, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the United States. The main piece of the story is about the peaceful town of Klondike in Dawson being turned upside down by new residents of the town of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, came up with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), building a saloon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and trying to run the city's restaurants and hang-out place from business. It paved the way for McIntire and its goons to come, too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the top of the Western genre, The Spur Naked. The far country is just the least bit less, and it has 99.9% of what made that movie so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. As with the nail Spur, the country is well-liked, on-site cinematography. The scenery is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, behind the window). I suppose he might consider clich√©, as he starts out a selfish solitaire and learns how that kind of existence plays from the end. Still, Stewart plays so damn well, making it a very human character. And their performance is universally supported. In addition to what I mentioned, Adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I must sole out Walter Brennen, as well. It seems to have been specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touchy, since it is, at first, the only character who can carry out any humanity of the cynical man. It's just fine writing, and the Man's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
