"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), with four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all maybe 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five have committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American like it looks like. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship of adolescents is intensely, and ultimately it is a willing sacrifice to try to help one of the groups who have encountered unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they went away separately and assembled in 1985 (the year before the movie was made). <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning there was a number of dialogues that had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversation speed asked, but I could not always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me not always to understand which characters were involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about getting tretomyin for a sick family member. This Yugoslavia comes to broadcast movies effectively targeting the adolescents' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong bonds and loyal to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, holding me guessing to the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis cast in 1953, and that was actually happening. <br /> I would miss it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
