That short is a puzzle. Words do not weaken me here, as this is almost indescribable, technically exceptional after more than 90 years (visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing), this is not something you look like if you like things that are ubiquitous or "normal "- because it's most certainly not either. This is one odd, gang.Non worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy hurt yourself, you may want to skip this.
