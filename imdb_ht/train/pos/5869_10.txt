after just having watched the Deer Hunter, who is a masterpiece, the film Jacknife was full of full shoes.it has same terms as the Deer Dog, devastating effect on someone after the Vietnam War .Robert De Niro is in this film like Hunter Hunter in Hope and is very good here, as is Kathy Baker.but this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, emotional and performance impact.the movie is based on a play, and there are one or two scenes where it feels obvious me.by that I just meant that for those one or two scenes she felt like I was watching a play.that scene was not great a deal, and not really diminished the movie.i actually really liked this movie.it is not an epic as the hunter hunters are about the same era and they have similar terms, but are two very different films.i thought Hunter in Hope was great, and I also think that this movie was great.it has acted in this one that makes it so great. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
