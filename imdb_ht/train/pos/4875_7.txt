"Papa is still on business" was heading in a review after "promising me this" premiere in Cannes. I understand why many think the same expression but unique in Kusturica is still present in his new movie, it is something why critics can not touch him. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear in its empty space it is still unique and intact. Amazing performance at Stribor Kusturica. Many more close-ups and fewer landscapes then in "life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has femme potential world-class potential, please do not spoil it. It is true, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
