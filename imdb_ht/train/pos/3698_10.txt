I did not know what this film was until I read about it in L.A weekly. I generally agree with the reviews of LA weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. The movie stars Molly Parker (from I Love TV to Deadwood) and Lukas Haas - whom I suspect we will see more in the very near future. The movie is funny, cheerful, great acting, and beautiful photography. I do not know if the movie has distribution, but I hope it does - or will - sooner. This is destined to be a real indie gem. It even has music by my favorite Jewish agents! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not in the screening. even without it ... that was but down the best movie I saw at the festival.
