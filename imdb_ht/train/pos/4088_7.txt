this one came out. Not much to say about it except that it deals with a topic that rarely touches in the beialite movie. I can see why this film was banned for long, the topics faced in the film are still a little taboo for most of the world saying the erotic film of the well deserved and adapted to the mood of the movie. It's a good movie that acts well and serves a purpose ... The viewer's shock and cross limits are often seen in film. I came across this film on the net that I thought I could check out. I enjoyed the movie as she thought provocative and somewhat erotic at the same time. Something you do not rarely see in today's movie.
