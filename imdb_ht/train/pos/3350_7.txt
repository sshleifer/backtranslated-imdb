I do not remember ever seeing this one before the evening, probably the title sounded so ordinary he was holding over me. But it is a well-crafted b Western, with an exciting brooding scenario complimentary by acting wisely out of good at rean. Robert Mitchum sloping in the open-city city is looking for his wife and news about their daughter, and staying for a while as a city-fury. As usual the popular business has mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the baddies, but as the business they carry. It always applies: to relax and drink gambling and promote industry, but to pretend to deplore the surprise effects it may have on ordinary people. What is fascinating on this movie is Mitchum's fun cinematic imagination to go on cleaning the town of baddies, and the townspeople acceptance that his violent methods are the only ones. Favorite bit: the sudden fall of 2 in the baddies of the red dog saloon. Shoot at the main saloon bordered on embarrassing, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of the poison. <br /> Overall a very good film and its only fault is to be a little hokeyness - not so good for doing Gooders that would probably rather a life of negotiation and evil rather than ending it.
