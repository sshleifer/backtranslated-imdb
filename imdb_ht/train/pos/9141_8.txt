You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about her music talent either or now. It looks like a shadow-that was twenty years later, but the music remains important and fantastic. <br /> Having lived in this film hype (high school graduate in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the moment. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to control "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun via the Parents Music Resource Center at each "Air Band" at the time of Human Prince, it was the sheer thing warmer. For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> We all waited for the movie and were soooooo excited when it premiered. It did not disappoint. Everyone was caught. I was a MTV junkie at the time (they actually played music then .... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this comment by saying that, at this time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Sheep of Seagull and others in the Punk / New Wave genre 'The Music of Prince of the Time transcends all kinds and styles. One of the reasons why some of it looks so cheese and straightened now is that it was big soooooooo then. All the things that remind you of the 80 were iconic then. It was mainstream and it looks like a glimpse 'right now. It was so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like the commercial commercial granny for Wendy's anchor. <br /> It seems stupid now because everyone was caught in it (sadly, kind of a scarce mechanical purple or something .. Anyway, I hope this gave us all a little insight.
