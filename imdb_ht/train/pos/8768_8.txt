I saw this movie in a store in the cheap section. I'm actually brightly remember to see the advertisers and trailer for it years ago. I thought "What hey" and bought it, basically because the sketch sounded interesting and Claire Danes was still a talented person in my eyes (this was also before I became a big fan of Beckinsale Kate). So it's about two girls that sneak into a vacation in Bangkok, get booted for narcotics (which are innocent) and then sent to a Thailand prison. The film follows what will happen and at times innocent questions. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performance, and the plot of this movie ends up up, and raises some nice moral discussion questions. <br /> I think this is a good movie solid but could have some improvement ... It could be longer ... it would have helped solidify these characters and more insight into the policies of justice system Thailand would help. /> However, other than that, it's a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all your culture culture junkies are vigilant for a couple of minutes by Paul Walker. I did not even notice it the first time I saw the movie.
