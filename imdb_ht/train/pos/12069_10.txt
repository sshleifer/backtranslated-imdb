Yes, it's flawed - especially if you're in Hollywood movie that requires great effect, a purely fun or fantasy story or draw, and you can not actually think for yourself. <br /> <br /> The Roeg movie is for the clever movie-goer, and insignificant is a perfect example. Characters are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like all of Nic Roeg's films - it has you to think about every level of aspects of reality that would never have started before you. His movie always makes you think, and personally, I like that in a movie. <br /> So do not expect to come away from watching this movie and feel all happy-happy, because it is possible you will be disappointed. <br /> But I think it's excellent.
