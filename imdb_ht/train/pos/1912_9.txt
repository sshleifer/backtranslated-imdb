I'll keep it short and short, those who wrote the story lines to show this is genius, the actors are just perfect for the role play (CJ's character is legendary) and there are so many chemistry on screen that make it so read is, a very successful comedy. <br /> When I first saw the new episodes that are probably going back just about 6/7 months, I wonder what happened to Paul. I was fined to find out that he was dead when I was Google. She was so funny and she played her character of perfection, a protective father, who loves to keep her daughter from the limelight and away boy. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I think, went into force in strength, even without Paul in it. <br /> More, I think most people would enjoy this watching it.
