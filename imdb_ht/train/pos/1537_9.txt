The movie takes place in a small village in which everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents for her father's birthday, which occasionally still has some kind of tragedy, the question is just what it will be this year, and you'll be surprised ... It's a very well-composed film, and a story that has a perfect balance of humor and gravity, which is rarely seen. You get happy, you get hurt, and basically everything in between. Finally you can not help fall in love with Mia (if you are a boy I guess (the main actress)) She is a very well-selected actress, as a lot of other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoy
