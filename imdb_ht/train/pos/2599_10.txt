Having enjoyed Joyce's novel complex so keenly I was prepared to be ashamed by Joseph Strick and Fred Haines's scenics, providing the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the movie turned out to be very well done with a fine translation of the tone, naturalist, and levity of the book. It certainly helps them read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine the latter would seem disjointed, and very odd episodes apparently randomly stitch together, without a previous reading of the text helping to grasp the plot. <br /> It's amazing to see how the movie "dirty" is, given to it by shooting in Dublin in 1967. The Irish Irish movie only, ultimately, was forbidden to watch by general audience in Ireland as late in 2000 (he showed audience restrictions at a private movie theater, the Irish Film Theater, in the late 1970s). Erotic Joyce is not simply naturalist and raunchy, it offers many wildly inflated episodes. Never forget that many of these fetishes were acceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still net taboo when the movie was made in 1967. <br /> It is amazing and encouraged to watch the Irish cream Professionally acting in the 1960s, players respect all, nana to pronounce and adopt Joyce's transgressive textures with such love. <br /> Bravo!
