This is one of the best in the series, set up with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (Or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good storyline in which you play like Claire Redfield in search of his brother, Chris Redfield (Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil) It's like scary like other Resident Evil, and it has lots of cutscenes. <br /> Rating: **** from Stars Stars (Rating based on other videogames comparisons)
