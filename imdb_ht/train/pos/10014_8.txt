Night readers kept my attention, and Robin Williams shone as a New York City radio host that gets romanticized with his friendship with an old 14-year-old son (Rory Culkin) who is very sick. Williams never encountered the boy in person, just as they were just in touch by talking on the phone. However, former Williams companion (beautiful work at Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, who invites Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I'll leave it at that. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> I enjoyed this movie, and Toni Collette provided a memorable portrait of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also starred as Williams' friends. The night reader is inspired by actual events, and he has a dull, almost creepy silence at all. At times it is predictable, there is no thanks to some of the comments I read before seeing the movie and just because of logic, but I liked it anyway. I love Williams in the role of this, more so than his comedy character for what was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
