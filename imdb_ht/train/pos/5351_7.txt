Although this film is somewhat full of eighty cheese I have a place to read in my DVD rack and I do not know why. I think I love it because the moral of the story is 'TV is trash for turning it and going and getting a life'. For those of us who decided to be careful of the message then you should try to read the book, nothing like the movie at all. Reducing it to you at the end of the story a deadly wounded Richards finish up crashing into an aircraft in the network building, killing himself, all inside and closing down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it would be difficult to compare it to 9/11.
