They brought me out of the show first. Welcome to Trinity County. A small Mayberry sleep with such a slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the shuttle. Do not like you could not figure it out in 10 minutes anyway. <br /> Oh, but this is not all. It seems that Satan has a son called Caleb. Some people are trying to keep it good, but it's a tough fight. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows that Caleb is and loves to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Sibtil. Sneaky. It does not always come out like evil. Most of the time it is a hero. Everyone has to be a great favor, because he often lies in harm's way and rescues them from him. So every time you think someone will finally take it down, one of his friends from nowhere to sabotage it. In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb came from the woods in a cabin and some guys and guns decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience. If he had no conscience, it would be injected now. If he had a real awareness, he would never become a criminal. So he started calling him Half Ted. It was very funny. It was taunting criminals. And of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-Ted ever. And of course it was in full control of all time. They have actually favored Satan. <br /> <br /> Very Very Excellent Show. It was one of my favorite favorite shows ever. Twilight Stalker Night Circle of American Scary Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> This Good Company.
