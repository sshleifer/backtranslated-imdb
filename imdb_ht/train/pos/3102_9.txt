I saw the Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I have already seen the first two films and I love them, but ultimatum, I liked. <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an amnesia suffers CIA silver on the run, trying to discover who he is. <br /> As I've already said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no draw sketch, slow scene, everything was just rhythm and it fit into the well with the other films, but in all The essence of it was many Best demonstrations, car chassis, actors, and effects I saw in a movie all summer, (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) but I read it was not just action in this movie Jason does not just kill and run. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama included. But it does not slow down it. <br /> Of all the "three" from the last summer, this was the best.
