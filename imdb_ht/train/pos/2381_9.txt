"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes through great efforts and restores the recreational length of H. G. Wells' classic books. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who watch her movie with me, appreciate the fact that it was not standard, predicted Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. version of Spielberg and Tom Cruise which had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who consider themselves as "critical" amateur look only at criticizing everything they can. Others rate a movie on a more important basis, such as being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". We enjoyed the efforts of Mr. Hines being put in being faithful to H. G. Wells' novel, and we found it to be very fun. This made it easy to neglect what the "critics" saw to be its imperfection.
