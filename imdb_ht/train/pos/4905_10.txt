"An album of songs so old people think they're new." This film has the elusive combination of speed and mood that puts some films apart from the opening times. And why not? Visit talent from Dith Judith Dench as a widow playing saxophone with a street maker to help her find the right songs, Olympia Dukakis as the traveling lively traveling to a Scottish mansion on the pensions of her many wedding, Ian Holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a World War II all girls (more or less) swing sounds. But wait, there is more. Adding to Leslie Caron on bass, with Clio Laine incomparable on vocal lead, at last, and blond bombs are the hottest group in England since the Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner. Elizabeth (Dench) spends the movie all trying to meet the Blond Bombshells to play in her daughter's dance dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a wide range of sex-oriented women at stage stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after an act called "Open Wound." At one age when actresses are over time by the time they are 30, the second most popular album is a bigger compilation, and more than one month old music has almost no chance of air, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie from, where else, the BBC. <br /> I love this movie, and I know I'll watch it many times, and enjoy it more every time.
