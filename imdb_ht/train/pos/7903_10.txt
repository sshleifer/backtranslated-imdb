I saw this movie the first few seconds voice T.R. took me to the trip - well I threw the big thumbs in the beginning, but the humorous humor and looks like the guards of both actors sissy - I do not know who was playing the young - but it was great and that was uma press - <br /> <br /> the other two people where the movie came out after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it is still a test to watch my movie love good and one of my friends - and we both enjoyed it too much - hilarious laugh - sadness about "realistic police-norms". both of us fans of T.Robbins book ... I found it well done - thought, Robbins would also approve, even if I do not have an idea if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br/> I would like to see the cut out stuff - I hear that gus v. Sand took many scenes because of the first-time viewers (or producers ???) quite well he's an artistic movie. much too short if ... it is one of favorites ever - and I am aware of it that the majority of people can not stand that kind of movie and assume that those who enjoy that movie are also what they think. .... that is a pity. hopefully will come the day that there will be a DVD and the full stuff - hope to see more of crispian, keanu - wait to see her baby and all <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, think of time, and enjoy it if you made the choice to look ... m
