Although there was a few rough stains and some draw lines that were not exactly true characters, this was Classic H: very much. The characters, outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andrew Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well-acting as anything ever to favor the small screen. /> <br /> "Omizid: The Movie" aka "Everlasting Life" is a sticker fan, but stands on its own as well as any Episode Episode 2 of the series. Fountain, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done a great job of pulling loose loose from 7 seasons and all major cast members in the "Best Dude on TV" show for the final series that NBC never bothers to give it. True to "Training", there was no window happy, as is life. This has always put this show apart from the show candy-cook knife show on TV. Kudos writers and the cast of creating something about the series of films and films that teleplay television viewers and producers alike. ** I call myself a "homicide maniac" if there is no other reason to keep my co-workers in a cooperative attitude. **
