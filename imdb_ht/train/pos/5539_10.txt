When I watched this movie the first time, a copy was taped and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still own the tape, and I confess, I watched it more than once from the beginning of the end! The movie is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often involuntary fun! I've gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've got some big laughs from the terrible script. The movie concerns a couple, (remember this is as early as the 70s so they are just too hip people!) Which goes on a camp-weekend tour of what I believe was supposed to be in upstate New York State. They have some hilarious dialogues after catching and eating a fish and the girl stouting death of the fish and being ate it! The guy came back with something to jump over as they ate the fish and now he was part of them, and he went; "And this wonderful person!" Hey man, really heavy! LOL! Anyway, together comes a couple of veterinarian Vietnam, one of which plays the flute, I believe. (At any rate are music friends!) The guys clearly attracted the girl and when the couple proved to be frustrated, they ended up terrorizing them during the night. The guy ends up cages in a chicken coop, and she watched her girlfriends were ravished by the two men. Actually, at the end of the night, she seems to be nice to her, and when morning comes, the guys leave with the girl and the guys are free to leave. Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone anyone looking for a damn good laugh! She never fails to entertain me anyway! If I could get this on DVD and replace my old tapes, I would actually buy it again, it's classic camp! You have to love this stuff!
