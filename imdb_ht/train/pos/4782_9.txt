Well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch. There is no supernatural thing, not violence, no profanity. But it's a nice movie flick. It's a little slow, but maybe that was intentional because it's the story of an old-man's 6-week (that's best I guess for its duration) trip. Characters are people everyday and so, they are credible. The good performances and the final stage were extremely touchy. Everyone with a sibling can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they returned to the old days and all the forgotten fights.
