First, I saw this film during and film International Film course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps, for years-living or wisdom-accumulated reasons, appreciate the slow, meditative rhythm of the film narrative. Languorous with the heat and dirt in an arid slide, the story is deeply psychological, replete with symbolic multi-layered, with an articulated inversion in the theme of being 'the other' in a country that one does not understand. The understanding that comes is filled with unresolved and subjective memories of the outsider. Made nearly 20 years ago, it is also a precursor to a genre of many other international films that explore the colonial themes of colonized space, clueless in the nuances of their culture in which they came. Many more filishly filmed-and funded-works that have since been reflecting the same themes: Indochine, no place in Africa is from that in comparison to possibly making Chocolat looks pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping or extreme action. The wrinkles are mental, emotional and subtle. But that being said, it's a fine movie, worth a look.
