I thought how Grinch's stolen Christmas was a very good movie. It was not terrible, nor was it great, but it was enjoyable to watch. I felt as if Jim Carrey got a little annoying at times .You made Grinch look like a special education person, when all he needed was bad and devious, but again he turned out to be kind of retarded.I thought the scenery, when not inside the Grinch Grove, was beautiful, and There was a few parts I was laughing, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could be "SO" better if Grinch 's personality was changed, and they included some more laughing scenes, because most of the humor was not funny .I love how Grinch has stolen Christmas anyway but It's nothing to get excited about seeing.
