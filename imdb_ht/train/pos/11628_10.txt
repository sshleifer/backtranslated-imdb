"I did not want this to get complicated, squeezed. I have to assume it will read." Fear flew at 30,000 feet in this taut, thriller action. A night flight in Miami rapidly becomes a struggle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realized his scissors (Cillian Murphy) is planning to use it as part of a cooling assassination scheme. As the minute ticks are not, it's a race against time warning the potential victims before it's late. <br /> One of the many reasons I like this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are both of my favorite actors. For example, the early scenes from the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people keep running in each other .... I got from it to the two as well, to make a movie like this work. Specifically, Murphy's character .. Jackson really seems to be sort of complicated in this way that he acts good and innocent, but he's trying to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally blocked. I mean, in some parts it really seems to be concerned for Lisa. <br /> A great thrill ride along the way. A lot of movies I'd hate to see a prequel or ending over, but actually I would not mind a prequel to this one, which would take place with Jackson monitoring Lisa. Favorite scenes are probably bleeding headbutt, because it was so unexpected. There was also that nice support of the famous 'pens' scene. When will it move? There was also that beautiful change of Lisa McAdam, where she changed herself from being a victim of fighting back. I also liked the scene where she sat in the court and pretended to ask some lady a survey on the food court. How big was Murphy and weezing all his .....
