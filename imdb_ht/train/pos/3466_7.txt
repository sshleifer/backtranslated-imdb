This was a real pleasure of guilt ... I saw the trailer with all the advertisements, so I figured out why why not check out this movie vh1? and, as they say about t.v., 'I can not believe I look all the stuff!' Quinn and Harris were boy beatle credible, and, although the accents were sort of over-the-top and difficult to decode at times, I found the dialogue credible as well. The movie touches on the mourning relationships of Len / mc and shows how, deeply, simply two guys who grew up close together and shared a passion for music - come to it, though, with different sets of problems and personal needs. you find yourself wishing they'd jump into the taxi for snl for an impromptu meeting that would hit socks in the world, but we also get a bigger appreciation for why they did not.
