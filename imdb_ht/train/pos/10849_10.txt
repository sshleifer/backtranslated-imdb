This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever- a British, this is the best spinach spinach. Characters are credible, the scheme is great, and you can really empathize with some of the events - such as Ray's and fitting issues in the group. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Period period real, though it is in the same key, you'll stick to some of the songs for days. What I liked was the almost all-British cast, and some of the favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... The film never craves, she just goes to the right pace, and she has some really funny sections of her. A generator of some really good catchphrases! <br /> It's a Hidden Diamond.
