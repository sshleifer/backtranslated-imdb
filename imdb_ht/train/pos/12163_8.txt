I found the movie quite expressive, the road was the main character losing but the same more clear on certain things in life than those who passed it (platmate it for example). <br /> It was tortured and you liked to watch it were tortured! he had this perverted side that was scary, but we were all happy to see him out of the misery again. <br /> It was like a game character or pan-man in a mine-enemy or enemy and we like to watch it under sniper attack or fire, but then in the end we are happy to see him Survive ... <br /> <br />.
