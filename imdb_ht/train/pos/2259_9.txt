I bought this cheap from the rest of our local store. It was almost mint, and I never heard of it before. Clearly nobody else was either. <br /> I can not believe my luck. You go to the whole domain of emotion and try to get on a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphant position of the Mandela Party, undoubtedly. Despite my enormous length (I watched it in two sessions) - it was like a single book could not be put down. Perhaps the songs are not all that memorable, but the spirit of the stuff grows forever. I can not comment that a music (clearly designed for stage) is not realistic! I saw the "South Pacific" and read the book too, and can guarantee that music is not realistic compared to the book. I'll treasure this little bit until it's out. One day they will do this again on a better budget. <br /> <br />
