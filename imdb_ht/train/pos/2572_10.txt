I thought it was a very funny movie. I love cinema movies and comedy movies so combine they were twice as good. K-9, K-911, and K-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is surreptic and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable to make a great team. The only downside is that I really did not understand how Dooley's wife died. He died before this movie but how? If it was said I must miss it. Other than that I give it two inches / up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had a lot of training. They were so funny with all the noise Jerry Lee would do when Dooley talked with him was so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee was singing and when he bitten private people to find very pretty funny lol information
