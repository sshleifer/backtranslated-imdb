Remember Early in Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number you made to REAL actually rent the movie on t.v. As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone to PPV and asked to rent it. Then you get the nerve to do it and watching four hours of soft core does not have crap angles. Well the reason I bring that up is because this movie too was about ppv. And I remember almost every stage of the add. I was at a kick in the past few years to find all the great movies I used to see as a kid and this was one of them. It's one when it's about to be tough. All cast stars trying to commit the perfect bubble but nothing goes right. There are many hoods that are good and this one has fallen into this category. She had enough action and laugh to maintain her academic success. check it if you dare!
