I first caught the movie on its first run on the HBO (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I do not remember seeing Alfred E. Neuman's rays shown in the theater trailers. When the MAD Magazine saturated the film and suddenly stopped halfway through the exquisite "gang of usual" for lowering themselves in satire as a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at their head, which I'm sure was, but they are seriously getting (with Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credit, I was quite surprised. Surely there are so many movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on now (at age 32) and the MAD remittances, I still get a kick out of it. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his jewelery jewel in performance (says AGAAAAIN)
