I read the 5th grade hole when I heard that I was doing a movie I was ecstatic! Of course, they took care of myself, I did not get the chance to see the movie in the theater. Hole was in driving-in just out of town but, alas, we were just too busy. I was amazed to hear that all my friends saw it and none of them invited me! They all said it was good, but I had read great books that made movies so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see she came. It was out this week and my parents went on a cruise and I stayed at babysit. My sister, who is 9, and I look at it and absolutely loved it! I then took it to the others I was babysitting's house and kids, 9 and 4, liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they were struggling to film critics. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands moral family and loves a hilarious cast! This movie should be on your head 5 "see" list !!!!
