At that moment I remember being amazed and amused by this movie. I refer to it as the most important film I would see in ten years, and found myself spong in people who said the same things. <br /> Bernhard has a very behavioral behavior behavior. And he formed the personality of harassment that we all had, in a corrosive, world-wide adult. The two together provide a thrilling mix that can be too scary for some viewers. (Hi jump .. I wish you were not my brother so I could **** you!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards search for himself after returning to LA from New York, results In the immersive try-on of various people (all of which fit harm) for our entertainment, but enough of them involves acting out of calls to a system "black imperative" real-life barometer in his resume is if culture black accept it. (It was a short time .. Nina Simone comes to mind .. And she has an impressive, solidly-built black lover in the movie) A pretty black girl goes to the shows, and she seems to clear faux-thinly Sandra, but finally dismiss it. <br /> As Catholics consider themselves to suffer for Christ, here Sandra paints himself suffering from the hands of a black culture in which he craves somewhere; as if he cherished his dignity and his rejection. It is the only value system involved in the film world, outside Bernhards confusion. <br /> For a nation with the main problem of racism and money, it's worthwhile to see one of the two topics being faced with in an atypical way.
