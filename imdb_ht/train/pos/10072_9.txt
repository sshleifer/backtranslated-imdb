An unexpected pleasure as I did not hear anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> A shame since its warrant has a wider audience. <br /> A wonderful story with a social message slowly said, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. Solidarity acts by principals. Very beautiful pictures and muted floating colors against gray that capture the nostalgic tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> My recent charging in Chinese films (showers, the Road Home, no less) was an interesting one that I hope to continue to explore. China and its people are an amazing fabric for movie makers. The "King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone who is interested in recent Chinese films. <br /> <br />
