It comes out of the left, and really is not what you expect. But I like that. Their most memorable movie experience comes from being amazed, if you ask me. If you have not tipped off on the mysterious "stuff" that makes these brothers so odd ... you are in for a treat. Throw is fantastic, but it does not stretch so much that it's evident. The special effects are out of nowhere (seriously, it's such a strange comic dark romantic until they do - then WOW) and they're great. The overall camera is easy on the eyes, the editing and the sound quality are very good, and the braided story unfolds without glitches. While not one of these aspects individually makes it a blockbuster, "what the hell?" ALONE factor makes it a movie treasure. People who hit this movie do not make any sense. It is one of those often overlooked flicks in the 90's that you've either never heard of, or dear you jump into the mention of its title. <br /> I'm in the letter group.
