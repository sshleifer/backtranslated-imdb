I did not expect to love this movie as much as I did. I got it simply because I saw it on the list of top 25 movie controversial at all times. It did not look particularly great. I was pleasantly surprised that he found out that he was one of the most clever films composed of the latest memory. <br /> It's about a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. It retains all the little information it collects in an enormous archive. She experiences and experiences in sex, political activism, and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew shows the film and we see the reactions in the story with each other. Nudity, explicit sex, and controversial policies keep this movie from being shown in the U.S. while its seizure by Customs has been appealed. The film is a narrative yet it's a documentary that shows us the behind-the-scenic world of filmmakers during the narrative, the fourth wall being broken. This movie is the most direct way of making a movie I've ever seen. The film mostly works as a time capsule in the 1960's psychedelic go-on, freedom-fighting and sexual liberation. I like to think of it more than that. <br /> I did not think I would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I actually really do. This film is a treasure buried. Give it a try.
