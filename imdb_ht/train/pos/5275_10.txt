This movie is great! This cute movie! Finally, a movie that shows Muslims as people, there is no stereotypes here. This film is driven by the story, by the acting and above all by its terms, those of cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like light but they are not, at least not in this movie. The Vista's Grand Mosque in Mecca is absolutely meaningful and the audience provides a glimpse to a side of the Muslim world that is rarely in all of the times shown in the West. Here the people are caring, supportive, dedicated, tolerant and devoted to each other. What a welcome and delayed way to depart from the usual negative portals of Arabs. Exceptional film.
