I did not expect Val Kilmer to make a conviction of John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting it was not the legendary porn itself. In fact, dropping at all turns into amazing performance in this bottom-rated film. As mentioned earlier, find out the two-discs and watch the "Wadd" documentary first; It will give you a lot of background on the story that will be useful to appreciate the movie. Some people seem happy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might include, one of which is that John Holmes' judge for the murderers was the first ever in the United States where these footage was used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid; It is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
