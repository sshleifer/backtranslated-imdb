This could be the most underrated film of its genre. I do not remember seeing any ads or advertisements for this one that could be the reason why it did not do well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and a really original horror movie. I rank it in the top 10 favorite favorite movies on my list. <br /> <br /> Movie starts with snapshots in photos and news articles tells us about a killer who calls himself "God." Then a man walks in a police station and tells the chief prince that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them left together to attend a place where the victims were buried that would help resolve the case. During this trip, the man began to tell the story of his brother and we returned to time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with the strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he received a divine message from God asking him to kill the spirits that appear to be regular human. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and ask his son to help him carry out this divine mission. This is an absolutely horrible and suspenseful movie that will keep you in the corner of your chair. The tension runs high, innocent people (or spirits?) Get killed and religious experiences are questioned. It does not have but a few very clever twists in the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend you. I own the DVD and it's one of her favorite horror-thrill ever.
