I watched this show on the base being said to have been reminiscent of Twin David Lynch's Twin - a show that I adore. The show quickly begins to introduce us to the main characters and rather thinness episode of pilot is me the best of the very, very dramatic it and really gets out all the wrong side of the show ready to progress through the rest in the season. A major criticism I was feeling a little down to the show - probably not in its own fault, as it was canceled after a season only 1, it seemed to show much potential show and it deserved a pure treatment good than it has received. The act is excellent, and this show has some of the best (good and evil characters) in it I have ever seen that they are well developed in a short space of time. The odd odd effect for the first 5 or ten shows is somewhat overly dramatic, but this is rectified as the season progresses. Well worth a look, definitely something out of the ordinary!
