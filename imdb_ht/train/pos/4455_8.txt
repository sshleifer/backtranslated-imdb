Even if I liked the best city I really like it. I'm a new one when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Even though I've heard of them I've never seen anything with them in it until recently. The first I saw Singin in the rain that made me a fan of the Gene. I think it is also best. But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts better than others, but in my book is an awesome movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I have yet to see them together in Taking me out of the Ballgame. But I stick to my gun bu say it I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!
