I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I liked it then, and recently became a VHS version. <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and asked again and again to watch it. <br /> I enjoyed watching it again too. Even though I have admitted it is not as good on a little TV. <br /> I do not have older children so I do not know what they think about it. <br /> <br /> Singing is very nice. My daughter keeps the songs on and off. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
