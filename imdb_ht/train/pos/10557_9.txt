Just see this in the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it's funny as hell and somewhat surreal. Take place in Toronto, where those losers live in this run-down home in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just as great as the losers wish the world would just go. Acting, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole movie looks very much like a low budget-budget. Principal / Writer Vincenzo Natali was in the presence of this screening, and it seemed intelligent and down-to-earth. This guy is so devised and great stories that work well in small budgets and put great budget Hollywood crap crap!
