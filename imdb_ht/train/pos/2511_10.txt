I went looking for this movie in fanny type mania. I just wanted to check it out. I did not wait for much. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? Not possible for many talents to live in one person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Obsessive aside, it quickly became one of my favorites! Lines of history and characters are not lost in typical hyped up Hollywood special effects. The story plucks into your emotions and pulls you together. As credit is rolled out, you suddenly realize you've stuck to the end. At times, the act looks a little over the head. I do, however, believe he does with comedy intentions and tightly into the character. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of witnessing. <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I found myself laughing hysterical or gasping unexpectedly about something I either miss or forget about the first or two around. <br /> I fully recommend this movie. Feel free to go in with your doubts, but I'm sure he'll find a place on your shelf.
