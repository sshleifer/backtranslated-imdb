This is one of the best Gods games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> The mission is very fun to play they have plenty of action in them to be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun to gun that you use them is really good. The cars in this game are really good driving missions are fun. This game James god has a good story. The voice on actors in this game is really good and it is cool that Piercing Brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like these look like in real life that is really cool. Also the graphics in this game are very good. <br /> <br /> Overall notes ********* from **********
