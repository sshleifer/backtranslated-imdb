"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that proclaimed a nobleman and good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America. It is both artfully valuable yet entirely accessible to commercials. No wonder it was a great success when initially released. But to be warned, it is also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made. Characters are memorable, well-developed, and finally tragic. The cinema should be applauded by giving us the Hollywood unfinished, something that was basically required by the 80s. Still, this is why I treasured 1967 to 1977 for American films. It's a time when well-done, innovative, and most of all weak films can be done with the great budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this happened by the time "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> The Direction by John Schlesinger performs the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental corrections. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" of age well. It's still as powerful now as it was when initially released. The act however is what makes this a masterpiece. Character 's origins are never fully explained, but their performance is fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (although sometimes actions are ill). Plus, being a fan of former exploitation film, I liked the scenes placed on the street infamously sleazy 42nd. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect with one of the most powerful movie ever made. (10/10)
