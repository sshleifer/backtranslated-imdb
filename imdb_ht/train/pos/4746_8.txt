This film appears to draw a borderline - on one side, people like it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. To begin with, there are a lot of terrible in comedy in this movie that many viewers are not "getting". Of course the Mask's Li's looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he was supposed to be, in a joke. The guy who has a time-bomb sewn in his heart - outrageous? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask, if this movie is supposed to be so funny, why is all too much violence and gossip? Well, for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and while Hong Kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme, it's certainly only a little more than average for a HK action film. Also, Black Mask is really kind of movie that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them Extreme, simply because the conventions themselves are utterly unrealistic. After decades of watching people get injected without any open apparent injuries, many were afraid to see Bonnie and Clyde and the ban on the Wild Wild Spouting bunch all over the place. But the fact is, when you shoot with quick metal projectiles, it's almost certain that blood will be sluggish, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese movie comic book. It is true that Spiderman films have never found this gory - but if they were faithful to their reality, they would be! Well, despite its comic-book origin, this film is faithful to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is flashy, over-stylized filming and editing. If the musicians in this movie have shot it with an eye to Hollywood-style nostalgia (like, for example, the Rocketeer, or the recent Captain Sky movie), I doubt anyone would get it offensive. But as it stands, I still had a fun lotta watching this movie.
