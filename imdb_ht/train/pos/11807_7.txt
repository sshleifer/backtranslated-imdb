After seeing Dick Tracy at $ 6.99 in my futuristic shop, I decided to give it a go without previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, clever funny movie and solid performance at all. The movie moves well, it's of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the movie are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was pleased to find that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as the girl in distress, she really impressed me and added her performance depth. If you go in with the mood of wanting to look a fun, clever and big movie acting with a solid script then give Dick a try. I do not think you'll be disappointed. And watch out for Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
