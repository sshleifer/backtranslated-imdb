I consider this movie to be the best one on Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's definitive performance Mike Hammer's. The Harry essex script is excellent and has many improvements over Mickey's Playplay novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and it makes good use of light and shadow. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch, as is the note by Franz Waxman. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in his memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the finest new eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should receive more opportunities. I always met this movie.
