The diverse field of Pentaxic Garden petitions (delightful writing and glee unhinged by Stephen Sachs) hit the various young adult youth "adults" (using the very wound theme) at Dayton Hall University, which is being closed for demolition. Featuring rounded act by the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her first and unpopular movie here as debbie, a bimbo who has himself broken by a car!), A hawk body of 10, okay make-up f / x pa Matthew Mungle, a little murderer (stick sticks bludgeoning, strangulation chicken wings, your standard drill in the head bit, that sort of thing was really), a downbeat surprise test that was later copied to "Intruder," A Scary Scale by Christopher Young's "Hellraiser", a girl smidgen of free girl nudity, and endearingly incompetent direction by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also bless us with the "Power" and "Kindred"), this Abismal abysmal entertainment slice'n'dice size up as a good deal of delectable dopey and low-class fun.
