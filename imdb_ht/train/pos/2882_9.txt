Cinderella was one of the first cinemas I saw, and me it is timeless. It's a nice looking movie, and gorgeous animation. My favorite animation scene was the radiostation scene - I just love those mice. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Snow White, but they are a pleasure to sing, and they are reminiscent of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a will and so is this love? are standouts. Characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mouse gives great comforter relief. Steps were also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I liked the best mad, he was really wrong, in comparison to a great character in the name of the Marenn Fairy. It is true, the movie jumps a little, and the antics of the mice, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it is overrated, disguise by you mean? It rarely plays on TV, but the really bad end make about Cinemagic on a regular basis. If you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try wonders of all time later, or the lavish slippers with the Rose, which is not as good. But whatever you do, avoid the end, which I have mistaken in owning, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
