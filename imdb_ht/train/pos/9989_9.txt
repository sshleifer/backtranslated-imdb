I had a chance to see a movie in this film lately. I believe he will be in Canada's theater some time around Mother's Day. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a comic feel-good movie - it's more on the lines of a feeling and thinking movie. <br /> <br /> The principal does an excellent job of developing character - leaving you in the heart, mind and hurts in Agar little by little. Before, attitude and behavior do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings sympathy. I found it enjoyable at the end of the film - particularly when it opens his heart to the young man in the hut by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful and meditative in so many of our own experiences in this world. His youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer in the very corner of their place - and in the kind of raw emotions that are so authentic and scarce. Ellen Page acts in this movie. She is so much different than the young woman she plays in Juno. He gives me an even greater appreciation for his ability to act. If you like it in Juno, you'll love it in the Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn as Agar. Luckily there is no way to express the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to let you forget all the other characters ever played. Never once in this movie I've ever thought of Ellen Burnstyn - I'm still and only thinking of Agar. He swept me into his character - hook, line and leak. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to capture this book featuring one of Canada's most reliable authors is impressive. It glossy brings to the screen both the stoney and the angelic parts of this complex woman, Agar - the angel of the rock.
