One of the temptations to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as 'the thought event' follows the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal scenario is a certain Bart Klever torturous quest for that ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of personality. The script for her new movie is taking shape together on her computer and in her own imagination. This film-monologue comes out as a response to the 8 Â½ 'Fellini and Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Exciting play with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience, revealing the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginative, paradoxical co-existence of two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For some time we are just on the side with the script writer, who believes that the cause of all misfortunes is the dreaded stereotypes of human mentality ('people', 'catholic', 'window machines'). And with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how one eliminated from the future movie. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the final thanks to the little common reputation of the wife of the creator, who deeply immersed in work, we realized that along with the main character we were again 'framing'. Really, is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to abandon your own name and day-to-day care for the young daughter? <br /> So who is it, this Bart Klever? Is it a brilliant profile or someone owning Frenhoffer from the ruler Balzac (just like the script writer's letter at the end of the deletion of everything written in computer writing)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
