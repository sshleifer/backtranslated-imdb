I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I never saw her show a Britse upper class until this film. He pulls it off very well, although you see the Clouseau Inspector Bits in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected that Hawn's youth to deliver such a solid performance. His timing was great and he was priceless. The way it alternates launcher characters seller down and seduces it is nice to look. Verbal sparring as I was rarely seen from a movie in that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the film fell flat. It is worth it down just to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a few seconds to glory early on. Enjoy it ...
