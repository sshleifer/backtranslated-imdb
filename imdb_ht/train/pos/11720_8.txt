I did not wait so much, and, to be honest, I did not like this movie the first time around, but watching her again and I realized that it's kind of cool. Sure, it's a single joke movie but it's a funny gag. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it might be best written and it might be. I think that this movie has the potential to be an over-the-top Vinny Cousin. But with a horrific army instead of an attorney. Unfortunately it is an opportunity to waste. And just a bit more writing it might be a classic. The children undergo no reason why they should get on Elvira. Apart from obvious reasons. It is good to see the relationships bloom. I know it is a comedy but it's the small difference that separates the good movies from the brilliant. Elvira himself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Whenever it smiles you will also be. It's hard to hit a movie when the main character is so good. And it really is his charm, do not let it seem foolish to think it's some sort of tart. Well it is. But it's a nice one. The sort of person you would have to look after your kids. Would not let it cook for them, though ... <br /> I would recommend giving it a go. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> It's more than just a great set of holes. It's also an incredible fear in the legs.
