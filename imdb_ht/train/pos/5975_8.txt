Every film critic and metal head hated this movie but I loved it. I saw this as a kid on TV somewhere and was amazed by the scenes where Sammi comes on stage and plays Trick or Treats by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typical of the 80's, guys came up around by bullies and supporters supporters to beat their seams but go away and be destroyed. Matt from Melrose Place selected on Skippy from family relationships for Skippy to become a record on Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to console her and to break in hell loss, the highlight of where Tony songs (lip-synchs) and dance In a metal song before the cockatoo hit the fan. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of mistakes and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my points pumping 8 out of 10
