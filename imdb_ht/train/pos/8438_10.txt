HLOTS was an exceptional set, which NYPD Blue will never be, about the real plot HLOTS, the real dialogue, the real relationships. With HLOTS back as a movie, tied all loose ends, it was good to have all the gang back together, even a few who went far out to show up (not to say how) the story was fast, emotional and full of spirits The series was the week and week out. Homicide, Life on the Streets, Network Drama at Its Best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Great UP and all this. Thanks to NBC to Give Us Finally We Did Not Get It!
