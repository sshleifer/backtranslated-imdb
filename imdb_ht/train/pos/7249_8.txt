It is difficult to give "just" the number of stars in this movie, but I'm still alive because of its high output value and that was, in 1968, an innovative approach to film in war. Remember also that I did not see him since 1969. But he made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day Devil must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. He accomplished this simply by describing very realistic actions such actions to a handful of soldiers in Northwestern Europe in 1944-45. No previous film has shown war in infantry's infantry and brutal details, and all in a cold dispazionate way allowing actions to speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comforter, no complicated storyline. Unfortunately, there is no finer silk. In part because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, accustomed to the cliche. As "entertainment," the movie does not do it, though it was clearly not intended to "entertain." He intended your slug on the head and the misery and terror of World War II and modern war in general. This was twenty years before platoon and thirty years before saving Ryan Private, both of them are far more movie films. Here the characters are flat and generally unpleasant, lack of a current scheme, and the realistic realizations (including what can be the first on-screen vomiting of theater history) to make the movie hard to sit in, though it is only 95 minutes. <br /> So 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it's over, a bonus star to have its heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> Like Carl Foreman's "Victors," a movie that was not trying, but the most exciting and thought-provoking film, the Long Days die does not seem like on DVD. Why? Both films were on cable a number of times.
