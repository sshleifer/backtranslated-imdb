I have long wanted to see this movie, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-draw was a waste of time, but the McCallum talent shines in this role of juvie. Thanks Sky for Turner Classic that unveils the show last week. I can imagine that there were so many problems with children after the war, especially with the way things were in the 1950s. Some of the boys are a bit scary. I certainly do not want to meet them on a well-lit street, much less one dark. There were some good good about the feelings of a firebug as well, or as it called it, a firefly.
