Allen and Julie moved to a mountain cabin after their daughter was murdered one night. No one knows who kills the girl but it's why they moved to the hills. So the couple moved into this cabin and was haunted by those who killed themselves and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it. This film has a lot of her chrysolym and has a lot of parts that make me jump. Some of the parties are predictable, but once in a while have a party I did not expect. It was a very good movie that was not the scandalous movie in the world but it was always scary enough to make it very good. <br /> I also like the finish because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. It is also a kind of sad movie as well as a horror film quite well done.
