I saw this first document totally fixed in its first release back in 2001, and it really had a profound effect on me, so many I listened to several of my friends to see him with me on repeated tests. The bottom line: None of my friends walked away shame (forever!). This stellar film is about Scottish art concept, Andy Goldsworthy, which creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) are created pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We found to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art, as well as some of its long-term installation facilities in important galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces of the natural world, as well. German film maker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directed, photographed and edited this meditation on creative process that is a real treat for both eyes and ears (with an ambient music note, composed & performed by Fred Frith, in music is generally edgy experimental / noise recording guitar, as well as a possible ensemble of musicians). Although this film was available on DVD for a few years now, if you can find a movie that is a revival of this fine film, by all means, get it out (it's a very easy movie that has been composed for the big screen , with a competent sound system really to experience this movie the right way). No rating MPAA, but it's nothing to offend (unless the birth of a sheep on screen was destined to offend or disrupt)
