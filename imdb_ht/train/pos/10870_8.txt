Personally, I found the movie to be quite a good look. He explains the current situation in triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police controls the situation triad and why police do not just go out and wipe triads. In general, the film is rather violent due to the gangland methods of murder & torture. But the movie remains true to the real world, so the violence on screen is just a reflection of what's really happening. <br /> I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia fan. Another good look would be Dragon Squad. This movie has more weapons than this, as in this movie is more knife than gun (in fact I do not remember seeing only one gun).
