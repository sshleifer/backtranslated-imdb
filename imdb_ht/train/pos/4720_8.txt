A beautiful movie, especially if you like the horses, WWII films and the Hungarian waveform. History of courage, compassion and loyalty beyond generation. The team is spectacular as well as the main characters' horses in his own training. <br /> I'll buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I recommend it very much. Family 'Nite' movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation in Hungary.The native inhabitants were very interesting in the way they stood the same grounds in facing certain deaths of a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down Brady. An hauntingly beautiful movie.
