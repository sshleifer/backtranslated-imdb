This movie is great. Simply. It's rare that you get a comedy and level, and this is a good example of these. When I saw this movie first, as the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... 'Do you just keep that?' For those who are close, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and those in the club, the DNA! Look at the various characters, each jostling for position, and if you do not see anything else, see the connection between the healing of Vick and the path to the movie. It's all in VICK's head! The opening line on Vick's world. The closed scene and the camera will go into Vick's head, and inside, a whole universe! Well-meaning, gigantic cartoon wonderful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
