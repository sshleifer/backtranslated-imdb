After watching this movie last night on Sundance, I realized that many of Nakata's styles were made first in this movie. Here we have plenty of the same elements in the RINGU series, especially the media idea being the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed video, we rather have a haunting studio and strange pictures appearing on film. In fact, the strange pictures appear on the movie immediately grab the video clip of the RINGU in mind. The only thing missing was obsolete in running water in Nakata's later film. The final scenes are quite refreshing, and a bit of a nod to Murnau, what with the opening door alone in the ghost idea of ​​entering the room, reminds me immediately at <br /> NOSFERATU. A refrigerated film that will think twice about going to a catwalk.
