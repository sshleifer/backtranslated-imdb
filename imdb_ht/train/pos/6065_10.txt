This film is horrible - in a 'so bad way in good' style. The scenario is rehashed from many other films of this kind, that I will not even bother to describe. It's a sword / sorcery picture, a kid expects to realize how important it is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil assistant / magician, a princess, a bearded creature ... you get the point. br> <br /> The first time I kept this movie was during a very difficult winter. I do not know why I decided to continue watching it for an additional five minutes before turning the channel, but when I took the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it until the end. <br /> Gulfax is a white, furry animal analogues of Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch. It looks like a person sticks a bunch of white rug mats together and forces the actor to put it. There are scenes where it seems the actor can not move around, or that he has almost fallen off. Although it is not in the movie that many, the few scenes are worth it! Looks like he's trying to talk smacking Bo Svenson, taking the comparison to Solo-Chewbacca at an even higher level! <br /> I actually bought this movie just because of this character, and still have it somewhere! <br /> Gulfax can look like sh! t, but did this movie !!! The only reason I never saw the end, or even sought out, was because of her absence! Maybe there should be a final movie, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a very anticipated return!
