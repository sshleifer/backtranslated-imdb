This movie, as low budget as it can, is one of the best psychological stairs I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good in a story it is, how beautifully writing the script is, and how big the movie has generated something so nice with money little .. <br /> <br /> All the elements of a big movie are here. The visuals, though shooting on digital, were gorgeous in place. Scarce, the bitter feeling of the movie was captured particularly well in the scene with the dog talking, that scene was just amazing. It's like a trippy piece of work, but not done in a firefighting way, and because of that I have a lot of respect for this movie. It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from many of the repetitive films that are out there.
