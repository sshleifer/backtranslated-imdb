This is a great movie for all ages. Read the story about three animals how to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist to the end and mostly throughout the entire movie. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and make you laugh. You just do not know what will happen next. The trekking house is all beautiful and all the wonderful wildlife scenes. The producers spent a lot of money for this movie and also showed. The animals in this movie were well trained and they are big actors / actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Renting or buying it today I can guarantee you will love it all the family will be!
