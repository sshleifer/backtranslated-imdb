When U.S. entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to move the propaganda films. The small American is probably the best of them because it stars Mary Pickford. Pickwick plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision is delayed because of the war as both people engage. <br /> <br /> When the ship pickford is surfing on the German flow (think Lusitania) because it is bringing ammunition, Pickford has a great scene as he stands on the lifeboat and yells of the German captain. Later, he ran into both Holt and Hatton when he was born as a prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille provides a really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt are wandering in a shelling village. They spend a church destroyed in which only one wall stops. Against the wall is a great cruise. As they stand and look, the wall collapses but Jesus's face remains, stop at the middle of time. It's a very surreal moment in a movie that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to look. He has always been a very natural actress who avoids the histrionics arms-lifting many other actors on the day they use. It's also very pretty nice. Holt is very good here in a leading role-man. Hatton is OK. Among the list of actors of "extra parts" are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill, and Edythe Chapman. great movie, but interesting to see US propaganda at work.
