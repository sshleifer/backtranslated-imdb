I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess it's the type of actress who was better not to act before camera, but just for himself. She did, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, he tried to add to more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the movie, so that he looked more like a mild editor. While in the other half, she totally put herself back to her everyday trace, and I just could not say it to be an editor any way. Therefore, his performance is not endured in this movie. The movie, on the whole, is attractive and inspiring. The character of Young is full and reasonable. Anyway, the movie tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only great flaw is that he did not show a turning point in the hero story and love the love. I'm totally confused when kissing the end of the story, because this is rather clear for the two people.
