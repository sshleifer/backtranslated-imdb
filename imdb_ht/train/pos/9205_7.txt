This one grew up over me. I love music R.D. Burman and in spite of the cruder elements in the story I've found so much to be moved by as I kept re-watching the movie. The siblings' line is powerful, I thought; There are also more probably obligatory things, such as fighting bar, a slide crime story, etc. which are just distracted. (Even if not infinite from a certain point of view.) Also English translation is definitely not a person for whom it was a bit of a stretch, and as stuffy as it is I'm grateful to him to do it. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, this one is melodramatic and opera-like, including here's not a song sung first by a little boy applauding his abusive sister happy, and then the same song sings 12 or so later years of the man who traveled to Kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl, grow up and troubled (he told his brother and mother they died), embraced her pain and drugs. / A super thing about this 1971 film is that it is on the hippie movement, which brought hordes of people in India, from an American point of view, which sees them as people driven in India by A spiritual hunger is excited by the weaknesses of their own society, but in India, living only for the fun of the moment. Hippie song-dancing-driven scenes are really wonderful, and accurate in the tones (I'm old enough to remember), and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young zoned-out teens are extract current hippies, as I remember hearing children about caravans in the East getting this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> (Not about the current Hare Krishna movement, though the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama song, as a current Indian actor group, related to the hippies, at the opening stage of the movie. ) Virginia
