what can i say? ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and love an American Indian, one single number of female beauty I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> you know I really do not remember much about the draw, or the situations or other actors. I only can remember about Erika dying gorgeous erinka and that in this movie she looks better than ever, I really do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care the beautiful moments I was a teenager in Brooklyn Just imagine Erika's beauty. <br /> Well just concluded if you're a fan of beauty Erika Eleniak's like me definitely this movie is for you.
