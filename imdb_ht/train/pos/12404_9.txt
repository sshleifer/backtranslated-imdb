I lived Rawlins then film was made and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the rear stage workings, from the Barbedwire coming alive in the electric chair up the floor wardens office. Also, it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from Viggo tiny. Also the door that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still called "Disney Gate" by the locals. If anyone is interested in all time at Rawlins, most of the cinema sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour. It was a lot of fun working for and with R. Harlin and wanted me to have a chance to do it again.
