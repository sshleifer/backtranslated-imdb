Gary Busey is the title of the title, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, or Maverick's unmissable cop that has been touched by his nickname because he does not know how much he got (38 and counting), he never stopped following the bad guys. > <br /> When an American tank called Thunderblast drives across the border of Mexico, it does not navigate revolutionary / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), whom which aligns itself with Russian bandits. Army personnel involved are kept prisoners, chief among them Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is happening to McBain's former girlfriend. McBain then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have the physical presence of saying, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have another lead appropriate for a movie of this type, but it's an explosion as a clean dude self-confidence in quick and wisecracks. Fluegel is a great female lead; It does not only seem incredibly sexy but makes for a babe good-kicking action action. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome the William Smith (as a great Russian) are shreds scum in the classic action movie tradition. Throwing in support is quite full of familiar and reliable characters actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Lankford and B.J. Goldman gives the script, based on a story by Lankford and director of Fred Olen Ray veteran. It's kind of script where you just know the writers have the language of the cheeks: they know the materials are absurd and cheesy, and just have fun throwing credibility out the window. Veteran Steve Carver action director kept it moving and deliver a respectable amount of bullets, explosions, and general all-out destruction. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a great pleasure for fans of action that does not mind changing brain now and then enjoying a generous variety of violence and humor. <br /> 7/10
