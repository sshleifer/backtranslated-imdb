When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, on the future look I gave and more than film-making mastery. This photo has a unique voice that will echo all of the movie history void. <br /> <br /> The opening mounting provides a splendid palette that eliminates JP Sarro using his artistic art on this fabric of entertainment. <br /> Sarro truly uses the camera as his brush while bringing us together on a ride wrapped in the audience of a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we've become accustomed to deeply diving into the black theme in betrayal, and the importance of the company. This film is the director's dream of its very basic. However, Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. This word, written by Tim Sheridan, was similar to breathtaking. The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors presence and charisma on the screen. Specially talk, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) where Vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a cruel all the time, which writes in a dark tone that she is the one The most frosty end I've ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. In a final note it was obvious that this production had no feat. <br /> Therefore, many praise must be given to producer Scott Shipley who seems to have the creativity and engineering market next to Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed a grand production so carefully directed to every little detail. A production worker is one of the toughest in any movie with Shipley making it look easy. <br /> All of this film combines creative writing, stunning production and mastery direction. This is the art of its best film. When finished in the movie only things that want to be more. The Romeo Division is groundbreaking, a prince and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is indeed art.
