It's a weekend I watched this movie funny. and I really like it. all the lovely kids, who remind me of my childhood and stupid thoughts. it is a real fun movie for a family group of night at the weekend, which could make lots of memories and laughs. Kid's humor always works. beautiful acting as well. Simple story but cool shooting. Nice job to direct the kid's way. When it comes to the kid movie, I think of "12 and keep". Another one this year but different aspects of the kid's world, which is real and cruel. scary work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every kid and family need. p.s. Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo".
