<br /> I really liked this movie. One of the rare films that Hollywood really does not do yet. William H Macy is just as big as the man hits with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this movie. He touches it in praise
