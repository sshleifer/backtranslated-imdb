Always my love of Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped my start-up and his performances in 1965 "Thunderball," led me to some unusual norm. Case of points, this British curiosity from 1959, "Carlton-Browne's F.O.," which features Lucianna in one of his earlier roles. She plays a princess in this one, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point. In this beautiful, often very funny movie, we learn from the Madeira-love island country of Gaillardia, which was a British colony until 1916 and then universal forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it became the center of worldwide attention and international spying when depositing the Cobalt values ​​to discover there, and his mayor Carlton-Browne bumbling at the Foreign Office took charge. Terry-Thomas welded this party nicely, as Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos in the small country. (This was Sellers' second film in 1959 regarding a small country matching blood and the world, the other being the "mouse that roar," of course.) Ian Bannen almost robbed the show here as the Gaillardia suavard, and My Lucianna girl as appeal as can be in his minor role. The movie exhibits many in the way of humor very dry, although some belly laughter has to be (the reception at the Gaillardian airport, for example, and especially the me-style parade of Gaillardian forces). With the Source 's sedan prime minister, and split his English with sweat spots ever, is yet another memorable character of this big actor Pantheon. Despite the occasional example or two inexpressible, stiff-upper-lip British gibberish, I found this picture to be a fun comedy entertainment, and well presented on this Anchor DVD DVD DVD.
