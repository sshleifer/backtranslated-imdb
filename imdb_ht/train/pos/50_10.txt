My children just got to stop in this night movie of the other and as things started to play out it really poke my interest. I had to head out for bowling league so I had to write it for me on the DVR so I could look the rest later. Well I just made her look in front of my shirt to dip after crying buckets. It was an excellent movie though I could almost feel the pain and heartache of these girls. And I've never been in a million years to guess the reason why Alissia went to this beautiful girl in an anti-social goth. This was probably my shirt soaked because I had experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I also would not look for this movie, but I'm sure I've seen it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love a good or tear-drunk drama.
