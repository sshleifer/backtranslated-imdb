One family (mother Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) went out for a family to get together in some remote homes in the winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving. This ragged some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (very slowly) went wrong. <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started watching this. The bulk of the comments for this, on this site, are very negative. Well ... I do not agree. The first it's not a horror movie. The horror does not even begin until close 30 minutes. It plays more like a family drama and horror elements throw in. On this level, it is very damn good. First - the bad thing: the pace is way too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; WAY too many sequences of false dreams; Wendigo barely in the face of the film and the clear view we get in the Wendigo to the end is mockable. <br /> <br /> The good thing: Pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as the mother; some good directions and strange sound effects that are a little scary; a very excitable sexual sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually needed for the integrity of the plot!); Very good act by Sullivan (only 10 at the moment!) and Speredakos with a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> I think many people are annoyed with this movie because it was pushed as a horror movie - which it is not. So, if you can ignore that, I think you would like it. I give it a 7.
