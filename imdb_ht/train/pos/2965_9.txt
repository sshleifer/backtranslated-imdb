Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this I suggest you see "South Park" one of the cartoons created. Buy it, you will laugh every time you see it. The most stringent engineering. If you do not think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
