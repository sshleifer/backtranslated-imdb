This has to be one of the most sincere sincere and touching boy-satisfied-girls ever made. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Saying Something" deliver beautiful portraits, this movie breaks down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This film focuses purely on budding a beautiful romance. You never doubt a second that the movie will lead towards the romantic parasite of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's simply happier happy to watch them get it. This film is mostly all-based dialogue. But each conversation is also very interesting. What makes this floating so romantic is how real it is. How in all this conversation, while often there is no real risk of anything critical, you can feel the nuances as these become more fond of and confident in each other. This is exactly how you would dream that you meet a special person. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This would be what would happen if you were confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed a random place. And what puts the icing on this movie is the magnificent series of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the movie suggests. And no matter how often I watch this movie, I do not think I'll ever shoot at that.
