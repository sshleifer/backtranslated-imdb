God! Zorro was the subject of about as many films like Tarzan, and probably was about as many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my own personal favorites, and as stated, it is one of the Top 5 sound series. Strangely enough, this is one production that came out of that water flow year in 1939. * By the time of this production of '39, Zorro was really well known as a (Pulp) literary and film character. The film opens with a small footnote on the History of Mexico's struggle for freedom of rule by a European monarchy, namely Spain. The story invites comparisons with the American Revolutionary War. The story focuses its attention to the mythical province of San Mendelito and its 'Council'. It was addressed by Benito Juarez ** on my gold relations in the new Republic of Mexico. Gold hikes must go to Mexico City. Don Francisco Uncle Diego Vega, states that he organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoy. A thug in del del Oro mob, staged a 'insult' in his head and challenged Don Francisco in a duel with swords , Don Frasncisco is getting the run. <br /> <br /> Immediately covering the dark masked blast appears in battle battle and after browsing the 'Z' trademark on the face of the bad guy, he sent it to the post afterwards. Don Francisco declares his death of Ramon Ward (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles. It also attempts to tell the true identity of Don del Oro but expires before filing statements. There is a great reception for Diego in the Hacienda Don Francisco, where Diego Disparo Ramon'sister (also the ward of Don Francisco) and his shy act. "A Dop !!", she stated. <br /> <br /> And Diego and Ramon slip away to join with a meeting of volunteers. When asked, "Who will bring us to Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon stated "Zorro, we are the Zorro Fighting Region!" Well there is a big fight with the Legion, now all clad on gray, with masks and helmets, protecting the Gold Train. Then Zorro seems to be trapped in a man who was born for the convoy, when, well, you know the end of the end chapter. <br /> <br /> Wow! That was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other Serials, one of the longest openings and has a lot of ground to be set to set up the story line. Let's just let it be enough to say that there are 11 more good, well-done, follow-up chapters. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Battle LEGION has all the elements that are made for cliffhanger action. We have an unknown leader who is wrongly founded between different groups. There are a number of suspicions as to who was really behind in the mask of 'Don del Oro'. We had soldiers, white rejects, hostile Indians and the Legion. In short, it's safe to say that there is everything one might want, and then some, in this Serial. And, incidentally, wisely chosen by the actors to affect any Mexican accent. <br /> <br /> As just what is here that ZFL stands out from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a more elaborate and interesting play music play and underlines the drama and action on the screen. The theme of the same opening appears in a pronounced guitar flute in the Cantina of Chapter One. This is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in track sound series. <br /> But there is one more feature that really lays legendary legends Fighting out in front of everyone else. That is, the movie not only has a heroic music theme, but it also sports lyrics, yes, the song Legionairres! We heard them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It really works well and adds the feelings we find in the look. When Serial was first featured on our local TV (about 1955), the entire gang immediately recognized Voice Hadley's voice as part of 'Captain Braddock from the Racket Squad, the TV Series. Mr. Hadley had a very different, deep voice .. He also cared for the role very well. His costume and especially the long mask looked very good and was probably very functional. <br /> There's a little slip up. A sort of minor anachronism made by Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) addressed San Mendelito's council, as Juarez was about 18 years old at the time (1824), and, even though it was later perhaps the largest single figure in the history of Mexico, it surely did not realize as important yet. His inclusion in history probably made money in the release of JUAREZ Warner Brothers' this year, which starred Paul Muni in the title role. This is not just choosing me as a top 5 sound series, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> We are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies this year, what with GONE and WIND, MR.SMITH goes to WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, WIZARD OF OZ, AT MUSIC AND HONEY, A MILLION BC, ZENOBIA, I WANT MY PEOPLE all counting among productions this year. <br /> ** Again, Juarez did not rise to any national importance until around 1850, about 25 years later. Also, the sub-divisions are referred to as 'Provinces' in the story. In fact, they are called 'United States'. As we call the United States of America, so also south of the border called Repubhlic in the United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was important to some of the 'A' pictures in which the rich voices that she saw exploited the good effect. Watch & listen to the story at the 92nd Street (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
