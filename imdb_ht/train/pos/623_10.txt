There are not many films around which gave me a feeling like Stardust did all the time in the movie. As magic fairy-tale like Princess Bride, Stardust is the most definitely the most beautiful fantasy spectacle in the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro specifically, I challenge anyone watching this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, and not a minus decimals.
