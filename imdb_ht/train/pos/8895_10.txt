I accidentally felt about this movie on TV, and I could not let it ... It's really an excellent movie that makes people learn about the US history and Vietnam's war, the time of the battle, fighting the battle. It shows the conflict of generations, in political opinion, in the race that took place in the 60's ... I was born in 1980 so I did not know all of this before ... In France, USA history is not a priority and that movie really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all actors are great; especially Jorda Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more then 1 times every day! It's really great ... that's a shame it only appears on TV from the movies ... <br /> <br />
