I believe I got this movie when I was a little buck. I remember watching her as a kid but I could never get the movie. I remember the good Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy King Koo Koo. I dug high and low for this movie and still have no luck. But one day when I moved from my childhood home I found it. We were assembled. I am 17 years old now. I still look at her. All the time actually. It's one of the funniest movies and touches I've ever seen and enjoy at the same time. And personally I think they should make an end. Mmm, yes a true end. Now I even consider getting the bird tattooed bird somewhere on my body!
