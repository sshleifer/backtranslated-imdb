I watch this film not very much and I do not know much about it. I loved it. A very good, tight sketch, an intriguing hook in the form of ugly, fat, deaf and old cats, and a march that keeps these flowing things without hurry. <br /> A lot, better movie than the same director. De battre mon coeur is arrested, boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not quite work was that supposedly ugly, the fat girl is neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from conventional beautiful, but with many characters in face him that he took on the screen every time he was on it. Superb. I wish he was in more movies, and the best of people than he generally is. I saw a bit of Gilles' wife and a little bit of the mustache, and they both looked like garbage, and I saw all the batting of my coins being locked up, and that's probably garbage. It seems there is a few coming, so I'll keep my fingers cross.
