A Canon Greene Canon Canon Canon Canon - adds its fake right now can be seen as virtuous. Director Shumlin, theater director, his stock boards and an oppressive frigidity that is appropriate to the material, and the compositions seem compelling inept to suggest anxiety. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 40s thriller!), The film has a righteous hero who gets mad and murderous (and perhaps paedofiliac), brilliantly brings the ideologies away from Civil War Spanish in painful reality, there is one terrible murder, an amazing spot in class with capitalism, smart metaphor theater, an unusual approach to the Greene God, and an end that is only happy if you do not know anything about history.
