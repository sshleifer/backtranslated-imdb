No, there is another! <br /> Because every Star Wars fans had an opinion on me, II & III and because this viewpoint was since we were missing so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, I'll point out the good points in "Back on Thursday "and a few bad points in the prequel. Of course, I liked the music, the special effects, of the droids, but this was too much debate elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we find in the original trilogy and in this film in particular: - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist position - Looking fascinating on Thursday's orders and strengths - Cute creatures - Ford's Harrison's smile - A killer scene: Near the end, when Vader looks alternatively to his son and the Emperor. The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black Helmet. But when it tramples and defeats his Master to save Luke, thereby risking his own life! Oh, boy! <br /> What's wrong in the INKHO prequel: - All elements of the "human factor" that the original cast could push forward is somehow lacking - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and Somersaults, than about good Understanding - Too much of Jedis at once and too much Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the conspiracy of the plot <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of strength as such Explained by Web Obi (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read some books about Buddhism and forms taken in Ancient Japan. Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the spiritual heritage of a master of his apprenticeship, from a son of his son, hitting these difficulties. "From my soul to my soul", (from my soul to you), as Bejard wrote to the end of master T. Deshimaru.
