I'm curious at which Beckett rifle was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he thought to be shot. If this is injury based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I guess it's a 7mm. round. I'm also curious in the rifle itself. He also made a comment on the final movie shooter on the rifle that the Vietnamese man left him using what belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever to do. I would like to know which rifle too. I know that this particular rifle did around WWII or in advance. I just could not get a close enough look at her watching the movie to identify her. As for Mr. Hathcocks killed, his long shot was 1.47 miles, and 93 was confirmed by killing and 14 without confirming death. After his wounds were somewhat cured from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching career in the USMC skills that they would need in the field. Career sniping is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters trained in the USMC. I found his name from my friend who is an ancient Marine. Any information would be great.
