Comedian comforts are still honest on a bunch of people (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven, and Diane Lane) are invited to spend a week at Tomawka, a Canadian (Ontario) Canada by former console (Alan Arkin). Writer / director Mike Binder drew his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a wireless and meaningful understanding. Also, the movie has many funny moments, some of which are quite rare as my favorite, one involves using tape masking. Newton Thomas Sigel (The "General Suspects", "Three Kings") provide the film with some impressive shots in the Canadian desert. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of the "bad" films and "gift", appears here as the Arklin member right-hand. Another thing, this movie reassures me that a camp should not make a site of murder.
