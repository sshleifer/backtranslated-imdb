I recently stumbled across this movie about five minutes to TNT in her, while vacationing in Florida ... (hey had some down time at the hotel, right?) I was surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any film feature length about TNT. I mean "driving me crazy" is not that already old, is it? <br /> But I stuck with it, it was quite surprising and entertained. Melissa plays her role as Jennifer's excellent psychologist. Throw in support (Nick, the senior companion, Karen, his best friend; and life-control parents) all added a great degree of credibility. The twist of the end was a beautiful closing in this story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, check it out! />
