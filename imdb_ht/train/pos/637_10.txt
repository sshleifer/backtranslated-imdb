Well, this show is nothing but true! He has a great storyline and draws with great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hott and she is perfect for the role! It is gunna great in Hollywood. It has a bright future ahead! This shows better than a long time because I really like to show this, and I hope it has a lot of success! It is so interesting. I was waiting for her to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and it's great! I tape it, too. I can watch it every time I want now! Too bad it's only about once a week though. I wish he was about at least twice a week because now I wish he was Tuesday everyday! Hope you all love this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
