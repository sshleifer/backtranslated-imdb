I'm a man, do not give women the movie, but this is really a good make special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person but he does one hell in a fine job, while DeNiro is himself the superb supporter himself. All so well done: act, direct, visual, environment, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a real and real love story - this is a winner.
