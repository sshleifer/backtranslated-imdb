Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that has the least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still great - a Duke of Wellington and a Fat Dr Johnson (writer in the first dictionary in England) performing this one series to be identified. There is still more hilarious one-material to be released in this series, and brings out the humor of a lesser-known era - of historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. The third Blackadder outing is not the most popular and well-known in the many, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a Butler at a stupid masterpiece is a comic and effectively one, and Hugh Laurie is at its best in this series. Really good! 9/10
