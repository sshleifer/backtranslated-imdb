I really enjoyed this drama in Sidney Lumet. The best word I could come to describe it is crazy. It launches the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and does not let you breathe until the credit starts rolling at the very end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the whole way. <br /> The story is very well fabricated and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complex Tarantino story. The acting is all amazing at all of the leads and even the small parts, thrown excellent. I also liked the cinematography, giving it the real feel as if it was an independent film. It was all great. <br /> This film is excited, tiring and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to look but you'll be happy that you did.
