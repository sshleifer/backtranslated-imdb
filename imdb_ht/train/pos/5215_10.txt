All I can say is the first movie this season that got my attention. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising .. I just looked at it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, true .. but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, things happening right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and make the best things and who gets laughter out on the commitments of the cause. Actually I can not seem to feel "touched in Hollywood" in the movie .. and that's what's doing it best. Both Claire and Richard did a great role, and deserve a 10 in my hand.
