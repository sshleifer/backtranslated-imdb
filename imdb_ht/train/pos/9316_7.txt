Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer in a criminal case in the "Unknown Man," a 1951 film also starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono can defend a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) has been accused of murder and gets his release. Shortly thereafter, he realized that the man was guilty and had extorting the protection of his victims as well as other buyers in the neighborhood. It is advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is small change, wiping out the organized crime, one has to find the top man. Mason found the head man, and was faced with a dilemma. <br /> <br /> The "Unknown Man" is a small, black and white film that manages to maintain the viewer's interests and twists its various plots, even though the plot is somewhat optimally. It's really the story of a good person seeking God, justice, and what he wants to do in order to attain it. And this is the most comparable part of all. I think there was a time before O.J., Menendez Brothers, etc., etc., when people believe in justice and the integrity of lawyers. For this viewer anyway, these days are long over. Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful, elegant attitude and declaratory voice shows us a successful, confident man, but also a deeply caring one. Pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years, but never really got superstardom. He was a solid actor who can play just about anything and did. It may be because by the time he got driven, he was well in his thirties and missed being a matured idol; or he might have missed that certain thing; or that he had typed early on as second lead to a big star like Greer Garson. Hard di. It provides an honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> Very good film and good performance.
