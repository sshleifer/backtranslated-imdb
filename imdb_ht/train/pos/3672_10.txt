A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), are trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. North Hollywood is the funny story of the struggles to pull everything together, despite a number of stringed conflicts. North Hollywood works as a movie in a very similar way to why This is the Tactical Instrument (1984) that works well. So, although exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind scenes" the facts that differ greatly from the public face of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie, and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Movie involves tens, if not hundreds of people. Many have incompatibility, motivation and personality. Especially important to the financiers and talent on the screen, as if either drop out or become undependable at any stage while the film is in production, it might jeopardize the entire affair, either requiring extensive or abandoned reserotes the movie all together. > <br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on these kind of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is impeccable and the performance is top notch. This is a must-see for any budding bookmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of making films. It should also be more fun than any viewer and a modic of intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> A 10 out of 10 from me.
