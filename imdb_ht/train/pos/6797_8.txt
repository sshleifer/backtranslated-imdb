There are some bad reviews here for this and I understand why but treat it as a budget filial budget serial killer and you might get more out of it than most. <br /> I thought this was working in a way because after that I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that some degree of success was not it? <br /> I would say there is just the right level to slay here to get under your skin although the act is perhaps a bit too uneven. David Hess is only in this brielfy so Don does not get your expectations up to you if you like the latest House. <br /> <br /> Other than that - worth a look.
