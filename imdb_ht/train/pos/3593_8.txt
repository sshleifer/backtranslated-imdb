Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with a little freaky and 2 x 4 on her shoulders. He is ready to fight anyone, especially his father who pays for his brother boxing lessons. Diana decided to boxing would be a great way to focus his anger. <br /> I love the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. See how the emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle.
