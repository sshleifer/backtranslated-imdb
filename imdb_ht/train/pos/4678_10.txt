I chose to watch this movie in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well-rounded performance sensitive that looks like the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job to carry the characters and stories of life and skill that is usually not seen in a first-time production. <br /> One interesting aspect of this film is the love of carpentry and New York City (the specific Brooklyn). The movie revolves around family furniture to conduct business with delicate cinematic films in both woodwork and ordinary Brooklyn life ?? again the director's kudos on this fine choice. <br /> <br /> This is gem and I'd whole recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).
