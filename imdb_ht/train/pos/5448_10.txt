This movie is probably my favorite movie ever. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a funny genius. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the movie is really really funny. A definite satire of horror movie, with a zany twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedy evening, then go with this classic rent. You will laugh all the way through!
