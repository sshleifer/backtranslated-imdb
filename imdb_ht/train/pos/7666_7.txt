Two magicians battle in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as a Kabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as an Anton Mordrid) trying to save it. "Doctor Mordrid" is an enjoyable fantasy price that offers lots of cheese.The plot is very funny and the Gore is completely absent, but the movie is very short and fun.So if you have enough time to kill to give this one a look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
