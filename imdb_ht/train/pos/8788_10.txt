Well, I'm happy to hear a rumor that this can finally be given on DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I'll grab it when it's released. <br /> In humble opinion, this is the most fun movie Errol Flynn, especially when Corbett's Gentleman Jim Corps career begins in the movie. Then she goes from a good movie to a big one. <br /> <br /> There are many people who can play male arrogant and still come as a likable good guy as well as Flynn could and this movie is a perfect example of that. Reporting, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe. You can just feel how much fun it was here. Ward Bond also seems he really enjoyed his role playing John L. Sullivan's famous. Bond, too, was never better. <br /> There is just the good amount of boxing action scenes here and they are very well done, too. Corbett's family is fun to look, too, as they carry in their positions during Jim's matches. From the arena, Corbett's constant argument and screaming can get a little too loud and annoying but to set the stage for a fitting conclusion. And speaking about the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the great Fighting is very touching with the highlight of the movie. Some critically mean critics (Variety, for example) did not like that ending neither the fact that many of the films are fictitious but - duh - the most films are fictitious, like it or not. And, in this case, he did for a beautiful and beautiful story to finish. (In real life, Corbett was a very soft-speaking gentleman, nothing like Flynn's paintings, but Flynn always made him a good guy.) This is one of the more fun classic films I have ever look and I'm waiting for the DVD.
