I said, Seven & Missing is better than I expected. The perceptions I took in the forecasts were that it would just humdrum but I was surprised to joke with this impressive mystery. Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insisted her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), does not attend part of her graduation a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway. When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something wrong and starts having a vision of her daughter and events that have led to her disappearance. This kind of, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it comes as credible. This original LMN movie premiered last night. 10/10
