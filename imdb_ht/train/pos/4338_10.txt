The movie was very moving. It was sensitive, and comical at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser were awarded the award winning performance. Olympics Dukakis was great. I understand due to the story line story he had to be short, but I wanted to see more of it-it's a true one. You will be able to remember the experience of your own life, hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in a Q and A after viewing. It's a wonderful, smart man, talking to a "real person". It was really a delightful night! This is a must see movie. You will be so grateful you have gone.
