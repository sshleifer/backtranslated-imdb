This was the beginning of it all! Granted, this is not his best friend, but this was the pilot show, let's not forget and not a bad thing. We present the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even in this first episode we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years, when Ross says 'I just want to get married again' with Rachel Storm and a wedding dress on ... probably Not intentional as at the time the writers went for a Monica-Joey relationship but suited nicely now when coming back. Another thing .. in this episode Rachel presented Chandler as if the two were never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called 'recovered' this is contradicted as two were met on the previous three occasions. But the point is this a good start to a great show. This episode can not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to, and the cast is still somewhat inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show became what it was! Keep watching, first season is an explosion !!
