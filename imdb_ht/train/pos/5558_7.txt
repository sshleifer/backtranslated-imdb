This story is a familiar one in long cartoons that runs Tom and Jerry, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one threaten to be evicted if they do not catch the mouse ( Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Living in the house with him, so this really upsets "Mammy De Shoes" that can not believe they have a mouse despite two cats in the house. /> Anyway, one of those who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the boot, so the tournament is over! Though territories are accustomed to still enjoy this because the cartoon has enough eye catchers to make fun. You have not only had the cats competing against each other but Jerry in the equation as well, so there was enough gag definitely definitely recommend if you're a fan of Tom & Jerry.
