For what it is, this is a very good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House") & Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both provide strong performances. The love interest is OK, but this is more of a guy's movie than a good movie date. I love Harleys, and I hate seeing them painted on "14 clothes in hand-rubber lacquer" and good old Olive Drab Army. There is a small story here in Harley-Davidson motorcycle playing a key role in WWII. I do not know if the training was quite like this cluster! The film kept my interest all the way off without getting slowed anywhere, with good action sequentially mounted. I like to watch the demographics of the voting story - one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 (true lover bike, I guess). I would not give it a 10, but I did it a 8. I did not squeeze every movie with the same scale. There are big-budget movies, and big actors, that you expect to be good for them when they fail to fail. (Star Wars - My episode is my best example) I liked the first three SW film, but I thought my episode was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I hope more of George Lucas.
