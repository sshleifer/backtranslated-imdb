From what I read a lot of people being humiliated in this movie, compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this, but after a bit of thought I thought they were wrong to be. Soderbergh continues its reality based on life life as it began in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution shifted from unpromising start to ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising start to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life had completely different results. He bravely chooses to say both in a fairly straightforward manner. The viewer can feel a better best coming out of the movie after Part 1 than Part 2 but that's the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we have seen different aspects of the war as the guerrilla have been successful. In Part 2 they can not catch a break and we see the numbers constantly reduced by death and capture. Take the Che and death to deal with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the Spanish dialogue. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Ajax. So, if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar saying in a very different story of Part 2.
