This movie re-writes movie history in every way. No one worries what people think about this movie, because it transcends critics. Each flaw in the movie is easy to overcome by the very amazing movie things that will be for him. It's a very beautiful movie, and I'm sure many of you will see anything like it anymore. I've seen it more times that I care for counting, and I always get transfusions every time, and a feeling that is difficult to describe. One for the ages.
