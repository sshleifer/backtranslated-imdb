Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovered Radium X - a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh was contaminated by the Radium and starred in the dark - and touched him causing instant deaths. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) has developed an antidote - but Rukh starts to go mad due to Radium and the antidote, and sets out to kill all he believes is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is funny with the "effects" that make Carloff 's glowing dark in the dark, but this is still a little fun chiller. It moves quickly, some great atmosphere (Rukh's notice "house" and the movie begins at a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) provide great performances. There is also good act by Franque Drake (like Rukh's wife) and purple Kemble Cooper (as her mother). So it's OK, but just a tooth below all the other Carloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is just too far-looking for me to swallow. Still I did. I give it a 7.
