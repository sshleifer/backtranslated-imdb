Michael Kallio provides a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who was horribly illiterate as a boy by monsters, abusive, alcoholic stepfather Barry (a really frightening paint by Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate romance (gently played by the beautiful Tracee Newberry) and a transcript of autopsy report in a local morgue. Haunted by his weak past, egged over by the bald, brilliant demon Jack (a really crazy Michael Robert Brandon), and was sent on the edge by the recent death of his mother, Eric go to the bottom of the valley, and hiring on a brute spree kill. Can be directed by Kallio (also written tightly, the script stiff), and exactly fine amendments by a sound cast no name (Jeff Steiger is especially good as Wannabe Eric's Angel Michael Guardian), rather rough, but in general Polished Cinematography by George Favorite, credible true-to-life character, crunchy crimes of raw violence, shocking and unflinchingly violence, a moody, spooky note by Dan Kolton, a finishing end of compromise, grungy Detroit, where Michigan, a tone grimly serious, with a stiff, narrative narrative remaining on a fixed track at all, this very powerful and fearless psychological horror film makes for frequent absorbed and disturbing look. A real travelers.
