Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a healing book that leads him seeking final retaliation! The rhythm is good in this movie and there is a lot of battle scenes to keep the movie going. Guillotine they fly look cruel and the main villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which I felt could have been a sequel). <br /> <br /> Campy and black, this is great ol skool kung fu !!
