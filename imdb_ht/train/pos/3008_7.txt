Unflappable William Powell. It is a joy to look at the screen as it makes its way into situations without a care in the world. He always looks to the top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him. Kill people are projects, barely human beings. I've noticed this is a staple in the whodunnit. Other than an occasional widow cry, the victims fulfill the function of being the movie's reason to exist. No longer. There are enough twists and turns keeping things interesting on the road and Powell is a master of this. There are a lot of unknown politics, especially as it relates to the Asian performers. This is a little hard to take. Throw is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent advantage.
