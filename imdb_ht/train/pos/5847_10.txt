Even if this series only runs a season, he stayed with me for 20 years. It was by far and above all my favorite cartoon ever. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get. If you find any means to see this series I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a really coherent storyline that was covered in multiple episodes. He also made me really care about the characters and what happened. The Heck character heck actually scared me sometimes. It was just odd at the time. Also, the group leader reminded me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / the right person in the series and can get them out on DVD please do not mean to do that !!!
