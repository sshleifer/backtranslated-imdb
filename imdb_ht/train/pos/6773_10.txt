I took this movie on T.V. Last Night, and you know Danny Masterson was a very nice player in the movie, and its Great to see him in something than that 70s show. The movie is not rated but in my opinion I would miss it (R) just because of the nudity and lots of adult content. But all of all I love her, I thought that dust wisecracks were very funny. Just basically on a guy who has no work, girlfriend, or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more of a truly messenger.) He receives framing for the murder of a Rock Star and the Rock star girlfriend is one to those who really need to help him out. I give it .... *** 3 Stars.
