Im not usually a guy in music, but if I chose what would be my favorite it would definitely be Oliver. This movie is so well done, the characters well shown, the costumes are spot on the act is good and the songs are great, my favorite was' Reviewing the Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gave a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was released in the late 60s , but my sisters were so, for the end of the week I had to put them together and to sing the singing songs, usually he was' Who will buy beautiful roses'so I already know all the songs before I saw the movie. It's a timeless music you definitely could not replenish it, it stands on its own. It's not accurate in the book and I do not think it would have worked so well if it was. I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, just as he wrote Oliver to describe the poverty in London, the orphanages, work homes and the poor they had to resort to in order to survive, and the movie show is very well.Also another great reason to watch this movie is bullseye type Old English Bull Terrier, her long thin leg notice, this has been brewed out of the breed many years ago, to be driven high and give them a sample like him, and it is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked at Victorian.Notis times having brand {which is probably makeup} on his face, Bill Sykes was probably using him to fight dog or for the deep pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kill in a rat pit. That is a nice dog any way, and notice it to disobey Bill Sykes after killing Nancy obviously has his standard by the top piece Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a great music to watch if you like musicals, and You do not like music to give it a try any way, there's something for everyone in this movie.
