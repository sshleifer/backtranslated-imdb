All of Mr. Barjatya's talent was shown in his first 3 cinemas, I thought they were all an accident because his 4th First First Black Currant was so bad. But I said it was not an accident. This guy is talented and how he made Vivah is just brilliant. Right from the first stage it affects you. The sequences between Chahid and Amrita are scary. The chemistry between these two actors gives guidance to that between SRK and Cajol. As usual Alok Nath as the good father and love is fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good at most scenes if Shahid looks a little young married but does a good job at a groom but timely but morally strong. This film will especially be loved by people who have gone through these beautiful moments of life. All in all a brilliant movie. hats for Mr Barjatya soy ...
