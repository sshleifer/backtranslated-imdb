50 years old, this fantasy music comedy can look his age, but he puts it with dignity. This movie is always great fun. Crosby never really romantic lead material, but it delivers the material and the lightly light edge it needs. Bendix plays great and it is great fun of a party that asks about its strength. Hardwicke - how joyous for a knight in the realm - one genuine - is thrown itself in such caperings and abandoned. With Rhonda Fleming enjoying herself in the least despicable of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappeared as a compelling Merlin. Even if it's not a music, the songs are pretty good, and the "dance" routine accompanied Okipe Make Nothing Perfect - Funny, Appropriate, Shine Without Hard, and Make a Virtue Out of Crosby's Music Movement That, leaving to be fair, was naturally fun and tiny it was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is fine, the sound is slightly muddy in place. br> <br /> And the story - well, it takes some freedom and the original, but I suspect that Mr Clemens might well have been happy with the result.
