This film stands upside down above the vast majority of romantic comedy movies. It is usually flawless! Writing, acting, designing, humorous and pathetic are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is fascinating and delightful! <br /> Every character is specifically delightful and memorable, from driving played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to many supporting roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even dad and her dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early exposure to films, so the casting is exceptional - and we have many current acting power that their career has changed by the effectiveness of this film. 'You've seen this movie several times all the way - that can sometimes deflate the impact of a movie substantially. More tellingly, I realized a few years ago that every time I channel-navigating my way to a scene in this movie - any scene - the scene was compelling and beautifully fabricated. There are many stunning and memorable performances of the original meeting between the Cher characters and Nicolas Cage, where her story cage is in misfortune; Vincent Gardenia discovered and squeezed it to the opera, among the beauties produced by my gold-plumbing business; Olympics Dukakis reprimands Jan Mahoney for philandering with his students in the classic line of liaison and co-worker: "Do not eat what you eat!"; Danny Aiello in his dead bed; Nicolas Cage "takes" Cher as the loyal to a ripe aria in the background! There are many great romantic comedy, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden original); When Harry met Sally; The apartment. <br /> No matter exactly Moonstruck!
