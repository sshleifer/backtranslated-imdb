As a "rebuttle" of the top 100 AFI films, the British Film Institute worked on a documentary with Martin Scorsese. I'm a big movie fan with my own pride on seeing so many films. But I'm now in comparison to my idol. In this fantastic document (though long), Scorsese walks the viewer in several stages of American history on film. This is divided into several sections including the West, the Gangster movie and the Noir. Full of bouncy enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great travel guide as well as a fantastic teacher.
