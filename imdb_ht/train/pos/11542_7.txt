The first time I saw this, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only about fifteen years old and thought that perhaps some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw it a second time a few months ago, and this time, because Felix's alleged attempt was abused at the outset of the film's film film in a bit. This scene made some of the things Oscar said and made Felix later in the movie seems vulnerable to cruelty, and their personal fervor was not as fun as they could. Did I not already know the story, I would have worried that some of Oscar's antics Felix could push him on the edge. As it was, she did not make me laugh or smile like the TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did. Still, all in all, a very good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcom on TV. 7 out of 10.
