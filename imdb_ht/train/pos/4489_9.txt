This movie is NOT about a cat and mouse fighting as stated in the other comment. It's about a cat that used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of breaking its last one. The chat is scary and scary of death all the time, hence the name of 'chat cat'. First Cat's Fraidy Life haunt her as ghosts from different eras in time and are still trying to kill her, but she is most frightening in the ninth life represented as a cloud in the shape of a 9 number and spitting out lighting bolt. very old now but would always be fun for the kids if you were caught in a copy. <br /> I watch this movie almost every day as a child: o)
