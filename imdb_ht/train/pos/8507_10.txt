Well you take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier turned to American bus driver who decided to rescue his passengers on his own only no other person who went with Arte Johnson into an absolutely right role as the travel guide who does not know what to do, but do not want to admit them in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three babies faced bad boys who intend to kidnap a heiress and let a busload of people die on the dessert, and you have had action , draw draw and a lot of drama. Everyone was good but seeing Lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my head. It was too credible as careless guy neglected not only wanted to kidnap the heir but raped the women and outraged the guy who tried to stop him. This was obviously long before he cultivated his good guy image. And believe me a 20 year old Lorenzo in tight jeans you really do not want to miss!
