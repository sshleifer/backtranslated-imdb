It's a colorful slasher movie. That's about it. <br /> It has elements of mystery that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher movies, but I never cared for these things. Face to figure out who's the bad guy is not that interesting to consider their suggestions are all misleading again. <br /> <br /> The scene of death was invented and gorey, bringing back memories of horror movies to 80 as Friday 13th. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful thing about this movie is that it's hard to determine the girl survive, unlike the SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not love slasher movies will not love this movie. As simple as that. I really enjoyed it and plan to look it again while waiting for the same thing. <br /> <br /> - MB
