NYC, 2022: greenhouse effect, oceans disappear, grinding unemployment and scarcity, power and foods. And New York's population of over $ 40 million. This is a little gem in a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for our 21st Century citizen. <br /> <br /> Opening the titles of these films is great: put music, a "tape-slip" sequence-low-tech that is composed entirely of archival archives from dawn to photography right up to 1973, painted an American pastoral inauguration developed into a polluted hell and crowded in less than 2 minutes. Successful and unmistakable, it's really memorable. Budget budgets are also behind cinematography rather inimaginable and other constraints, at odds with brilliant brilliant quotes. Seven police stations are an episode of the 70's detective TV, and the other interior sets the basic look of the best. The budget probably all went to trying to 'futurise' the Soylent Executive House 'Chelsea West' and the state-of-the-art art, meaning other costumes are perfunctory, some established the underpopulated bizarre vaccines and their exterior daylight Lost all shot in a filter smoke. <br /> <br /> The memorable scenes where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare foods to truly solicit their societies: They enjoy real burgers, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, apples, and beef and We really sense the lip-smacking appreciation of another's wealthy privileges. <br /> <br /> Robin's pivotal death scene, in which her character wants to euthenased in a place called 'Home', painted her in the flora of once-beautiful images of the world and deep as she gets Remember, very well, contrary to the realization of the jargon that the future was bankrupt, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is one smart movie, and its basic message is as important today as it was in the early 70s. Yes, I know we do not eat the dead again, but with the longevity of our resources, the spite of the spiral of poverty, the capitalist global capitalism and the destruction of habitat that is unclear for climate change, long-term predictions of 'Soylent Green' can happen .
