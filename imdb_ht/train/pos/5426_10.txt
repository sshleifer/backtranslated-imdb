It's about time that Gunga Din released on DVD. I can not say how many times I watched this movie fine but I never barred it. Lead actors worked well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an inevitable team. I just can not get on the exploits in India. Your first sight at the Three Sisters, is when you see them engage in fighting with other soldiers on a so-called treasured card. Three sergeants sent an expedition to find out what happened in the communications lines, they came into a mostly deserted city - or so they thought. <br /> <br /> They are engaged in the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" in hiding. Shortly after being attacked by a group of fools and barely making a return to base. <br /> <br /> Later on another mission to give Sgt Headers a chance to go hunting for the Gold and Din. They find the temple of gold and are blocked by the evil Kali supporters. Din is sent to seek help and get captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and are too captured. <br /> <br /> The faces have died, they look helpless as the regiments come to their rescue. The evil fishermen look with them over their surprise attack spring when a Din wound up on the golden bowl and bugle it out that then the British alerts in the ambush. In doing so, Din was shot dead. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack evil and quickly defeat them. In the end, Din is honored as it is made a honorable corporal in the British Army.
