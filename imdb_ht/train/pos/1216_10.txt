As a child I prefer the first Bear Care movie since this one seemed to be dark. I always sit down and look at the first one. As I got older I learned to prefer this one. What I think is that this film is too dark for babies, but as you get older, you learn to treasure it, since you understand it more, it does not seem as dark as it came back when you were a kid. > <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is so much deeper. It can contradict the movie first but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. The trees are just too adorable, I rewind being 'flying my color scene'. I tend to annoy everyone by singing him. <br /> <br /> The sound track is great! A great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this film, I've downloaded them all and all I listened, listened to 'our start' also known as 'reminded' at the time. I've always preferred this sound sound in the first, although I just totally love Carol Kings singing in the first 'Care-A-Lot movie' movie. <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation of both movies is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and looked at her about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent. It was really surprising. <br /> There is plenty of back up from others to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it is strange / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is about how Care Bears have come over and they defeat the Demon, Black Heart. The end is surprising and yet, beat any 'Pokemon movie' and the Care Bears Career issues. It leaves an effect on you. Again this film can teach everyone of all ages on morality.
