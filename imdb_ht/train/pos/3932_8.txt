In the same melody as Drum Americana along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictional yet highly credible. Henry Fonda has made three consecutive films in this era with Ford and all three are about a time and place with emphasis on the environment and cultural environment. In Mohawk, America's pioneers are in full bloom with Americans trying to fight against Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us 19th-Century America; a time when inventions and creativity began to flourish with that nation really became bigger. Among them all was a tall, lanky, young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln and his film fictional life as an attorney, predicting the greatness he would later accomplish. Fonda is superb in this movie, capturing the essence of what is considered to be the character of Lincoln, although no one knows exactly what it was like then. The compositions and casting support also work well together and provide a unique balance of the picturesque Ford of American dreams and its many forms. This is not a movie to be taken literally but rather symbolic, showing that Lincoln was indeed global warming for the events of his life that created his legacy. We even find some scenes between her and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together but that's not the point. I believe this is simply a tribute to the Lincoln Grand Prix, widely considered to be the greatest American president. His quiet and straightforward requirements were scarce and then would be today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more people like it.
