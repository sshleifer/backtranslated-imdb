The five deadly venom is a great movie kung-fu action wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. There are all the usual usual signs of a flick of Kung-Fu: great choreography, awful doubling, different "styles" in battle, and a wide range of exaggerated, often cheesy human emotions. However the plot certainly is better than average. It's interesting and keep your attention to the scenes that do not fight. Occasionally, it can even fire the hearing, such as when X characters receive horrific injustice. Another thing I like about the five deadly venom is the pretty simplicity of the movie's moral and theme. Just about everyone gets what's coming to them. The laugh, greedy, and corruption are lost. The bad guys, consumed by selfish greed are finally destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing. Guys are good to use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome their chances and out on top. <br /> <br /> Clan stone poison!
