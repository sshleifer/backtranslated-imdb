This great movie failed to record a rating higher than 5! Why not! It is a great painter in Christ's life without sensationalism without mercy of the Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash did many things for God that amazingly shunned and neglected in areas that should be of great importance, such as our church. The film itself took less than a month in films such as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him into it .Great credit to all people involved in this movie without resentment sincerely that they will always be cared for by fans its. In the smaller cruise Billy Graham rated it very enough to use it as a prime source of education for new Christians. Thanks to Fox for its product. As the Markets Line proved that it was freakish that the man survived alone produces such as a masterpiece underrated.Movies are not canonized by popular votes as this proven production! In summary I believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is immediately, honestly exhibiting and a great witness to Christian faith!
