I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the act and moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to say. I have to see the huge budget one out today, obviously having a lot more money being thrown at it, but it was very watchful. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you must take that into account when you look at it. There were some things that could be at best, but most are budget related. The act was very good F / X and the demonstrations were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the asst camera. and the boy who played the child. These types of films have been kept in working with this one who has returned from OK.
