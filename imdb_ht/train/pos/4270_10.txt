The tamo peva is the best comedy ever. Believe me I've seen a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one makes you smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that the humor of this comedy is special.It is caratherisic for Serbia. And all ancient republics of Yugoslavia know it very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: In Europe) can not enjoy it very much. Because the subtitles break the hole. But they should at least try !!!! Yes it's ironic! This is the best flick of Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see this one, do not blow up OK!
