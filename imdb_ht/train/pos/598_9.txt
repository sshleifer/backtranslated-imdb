Her a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, one of the cribs. :) I'm 19 years old now. My parents took me to try out for the party, we lived in Texas at the time. I think I've just made such 80 bucks for it, but I was not in it very long. My parents said I would cry when I was supposed to be happy and would be happy when I was supposed to cry. I was all mixing them. Strange and funny reality I would believe .. and no I'm not an actress. I live in San Antonio, workin 'of a Walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a great movie, though, good concept. I've seen it several times in my 19 short years.
