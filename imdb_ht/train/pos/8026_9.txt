During this movie, you might think that this movie is just for kids. Well, it is mostly pointing towards them, but it's also quite rounded enough and the jokes are also pointing at the adults at the audience. This time around, the Muppet gang tries to get on Broadway, and long-lasting canals keep them from producing it, leading them to divide them. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination to keep things moving together after receiving the contract together he gets hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> It's a throwing-up, in part, of those old beginning cars from the 40s and musical actually as the topic of a music, only here's the very usual of zaniness and wonderful moments throw in a pot at twisting comic moments (boomerang fish in the zoo's world; Gonzo's watercress display, the whisper campaign, among others), but also with a lot of heart. Mippet writers are not shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them at the point where it's almost refreshing to see such an 'allowed to put on a show' story where the thick and thought characters are meeting their dreams. <br /> While not as totally original in the dimensions of the Muppet movie, it has received many catchy and memorable songs, where all over Manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-dating species (and weddings)! Cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So, ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big and romantic laughs (romantic answer) and one of the best Muppet films.
