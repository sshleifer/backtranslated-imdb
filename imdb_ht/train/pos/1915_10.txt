Show this is awesome. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were sad; I'm actually calling. But other shows were scary; Kerry was my favorite character, because he was in the "dark side." I also thought that Bridget was funny because he was all perky. I also thought that guy who played Kyle was really, really nice. I loved it when Kerry made sarcasmic remarks on everything. The guy who played Rory was beautiful, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole world shows all TVs are funny, and I hope they always show it on TV. when she was shown on TV, though, I looked at her every time she was over. Next time it shows, I'll watch it over and over again.
