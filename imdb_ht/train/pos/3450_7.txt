Have you ever heard of this movie until I saw my rental DVD as a bit uncertain, there were so many films in the past and good drafts ensembles that can not make any movie a bad script, and in some cases does not look like care. <br /> Well that was just watching it there was no reason not to give this movie a theater release, it is good. The story as most of this genre may seem a little strain at times but there appears to be a good amount of realism here also allowing momentum to bring. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a Justin Timberlake works here with a great role, OK it's not Oscar stuff yet, but it will learn with each roles and it shows a lot of promises for the future here. Dylan McDermott also was amazingly good at unexpected roles and is definitely cream of the crop of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, just give it a go. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the end result.
