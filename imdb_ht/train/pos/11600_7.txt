William Hurt may not be an American Matinee idol, but still has very good taste in B-movie projects. Here, she plays a specialist in dangerous garbage clean-ups and a tragic past tracking down an endless loser on the run - played by Old Weller-cute boy who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. Actually very-boy Hardy Kruger Jr. - probably more beautiful than her dad - featured as the Wog's arrogant head in a horrible sequence in a chemical production plant that gets the moving story. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government member coming into the incident that gives inevitable and high-embarrassed love interests for heroes Hurt. Michael Brandon pops up playing a slimy take-no-prisoner kind of comeuppance you can not wait for. The Coca-Cola company has award-winning award-winning award for 2000 as a fully-featured drink producer, shooting romantic aside from a winter-winter postcard Hungary.
