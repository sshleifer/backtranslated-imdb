This is one of the movies that makes the best trailers pass full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt that missed the opportunity to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and gags have left hanging too long, with no definitive finish and really did not let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes has been under-utilized in this movie and needs more exposure, and more opportunities to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, plus a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for some sort of a feeling-good music video while the credit ends, something that came to a sting of a trade-mark these romantic comedy films, a thing about Mary, meeting parents but again, i has left feeling a little cheated by fact that this was a better movie and a little more music and firefighting punch lines. He felt like he was RUSHED in the theater.
