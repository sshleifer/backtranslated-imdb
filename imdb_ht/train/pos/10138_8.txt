Well it's time. I really gave up any and all hope that had to be an exception exception in the middle of this season's entry. While there were still too many drabs to enter hohum, at least this episode turned out well. It's rather ridiculous that Rob Schmidt's director who only has the bad not bad go to his credit and writer John Esposito who has only a few works in the script to date include story of the mummy and the Shift Cemetery should be the ones Give us the best writing and most thought-provoking episode of the season. In our "right to die" we are treated in the history of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode the couple has a conversation. Abbey kept cheating Cliff and it is desperately trying to win it back. While they talk, they find themselves in a car crash where Cliff is left and scratched only with ball, but Abbey is thrown into the car and catches fire when a spark blast with gasoline has been dripped over to catch him in fire. And this is just the setup people. Once at the Cliff Hospital must decide whether Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes. There is also a side effect. Each time he flatlined, Abbey went on a walk like a ghost and caused trouble for all sorts of people. But down here is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes all the time. From the virtuous effects of the taut script that are thrown into a few torsions I have never seen come up with suspense for trembling you can almost touch it, the right to die should be allowed to go to live forever.
