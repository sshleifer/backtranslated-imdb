White people + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nation + nature + animal = good. Simple formula. Actually, in recent days, the same type of propaganda used to defend the situation; Now it's used to attack it. However, being said, I think the film succeeded in overcoming politically hacked because it plays the terms of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. You can not be onside with the movie rubbishy revisionism in how the West won, it was lost. But anyone can feel a sense of craving for the days when horses might run freely on the West. (The film also easily sidesteps the fact that there was no horse in America before the white man had brought them there). Anyway, I love it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
