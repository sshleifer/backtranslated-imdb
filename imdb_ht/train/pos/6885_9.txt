It came by surprise. . The impact & resolution of this film was about how my automobiles were reactive to people and situations. Most clearly vibrant in anger in emotions. Much like the way a spoiled child should react when not finding the way. . .Money temperament if you want. Think I hid this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What cost me? Soooo very much. . very much blessing. Now I am present in how incredible humility I feel, and with a continuous attitude of life recognition. . For what is happening at this time, unexpectedly in my wildlife for life must be a particular way, the way I think life or people should be. This film contributes to my freedom now feel connected to others, unlimited & expectant. . .and connect with genuine love. . without fear of loss. . .Just love first, and accept what love is given.
