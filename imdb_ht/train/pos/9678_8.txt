Did I wish my own happy birds could speak. Tissue tissue on the revision of the film. A sweet tale that everyone's age will enjoy. Paulie is a lovable little treasure. It has quite a few smart lines that really make me laugh. I especially liked the dance sequences during his showbiz stint. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you applaud her on in her quest to be reunited with Marie. A good movie featuring two strong characters that really befriend the little parrot separates from his young owner. He wants to see more of the woman who gets blind and must abandon their mutual journey. I liked his artistic and poetic inspiration, a shame he could not share Paulie reunion. Blessed Paulie in her new home, at last with Marie, maybe along with the handsome young man who helped her defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
