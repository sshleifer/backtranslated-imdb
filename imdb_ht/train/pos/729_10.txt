I seriously love this movie so much, I'm never sick of watching it. The only line I really can not bump into this is when Riff calls himself a young lobotomy but other than that, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and he did not help to hear that he did not even know who the Ramones were until he filmed this movie but I could ignore his little snarly face for party most. Most people look at this and they are fans of the Ramones and really .. That's the only reason I like it very much. I never get tired of seeing DeeDee mess up her Pizza line or Joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over, haha. One of the best part of the movie is to see the songs you want to dance, down the halls of the high school .. I love it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, amazing PJ Sol is not about it. Maybe she's been working on another project * street * Anyway, big movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
