Cinderella In my opinion my favorite love story ever said I liked it as a kid and I love it now a wonderful Disney prince this is 1 of my favorite movies I love Disney. I could rave over and over on Cinderella and Disney all day but I'm going to give you a brief description of the story. When a girl's father dies she has to live with her evil stepmother, she steps just like the ugly drunks of Drusilla and Anastasia. Made home work thank all poor Cinderella days have only the little mice that scurry around the house and Bruno dog as friends. When one day is a letter sent home she tells all available women to go to a royal ball. Cinderellas move steps step mother and sister to try to prevent her presence Cinderella finally gets her dreams and wants and she can go to her captive beauty, genocide and beautiful nature to help her win her prince.
