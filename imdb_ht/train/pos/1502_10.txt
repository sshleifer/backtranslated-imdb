Late, the great Robert Bloch (author PSYCHO, for those of you who did not pay attention) scripted this story into scary and was absolutely one of the scary movies I've ever seen as a kid. (I walked MILES just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I came out of the theater; seeing a horror movie was still unnerving, but particularly so when it was as well executed as this one.) When I was given the opportunity to see this one several years ago on video (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised at how it got up. Take the scary test: watch it at night, alone, and tell me it's not scary.
