Robert Stack has never really gotten about losing a favorite Oscar Support for his role as Kyle's "Writing on the Wind" at 12-minute Anthony Quinn in the performance of "eager for life." Stack plays deeply disturbed the son of the alcohol in an oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who gets Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut in love with Mitch. History to play out of glorious colors under the capable direction of Douglas Circus, who really dominates the melodrama field and some incredible films, including "Imitation of Life," "All that is in heaven enabled," "Grandfather obsession, "and many others. <br /> Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone has a better Oscar comedy support. There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where he is inflaming loud music as his dad falls and dies on the stairs. We're going to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas, because he's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with him. It is so in love with Lucy who, from loyalty to Kyle, wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt it should be so worried to reach today no matter how much of love it was. Hudson and Bacall have the less interesting roles here - Mitch Hudson is the good guy who has been cleaning Kyle for his whole life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of moderation. Circus focuses on players more volatile to support. <br /> From the Circus, "Writing on the Wind" is an effective film, with the great scene toward the end of the castle is particularly interesting. The director had a gift for this kind of film, and even though he had many imitators, he never had an equal.
