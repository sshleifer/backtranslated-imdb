I was not expecting much of this film. I gave a ticket for an advanced screening. I just gotten off to work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and it seemed no fresh air flowing through the halls of the theater complex. Once sat in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie began, I did not recognize any of the actors at the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the film, getting more and more excited with every minute. I think this film is destined to be a fantasy / fairyal classic. The actors were fabulous, the speed was perfect, and the finish was magic.
