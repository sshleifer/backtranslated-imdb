I spent 5 hours soak in this movie. There is nothing I've ever seen coming near the funk movie that left me in. Never mind yourself dilemma dilemma, grave people on the screen to watch you. Personally engaged in the ninth degree, the film invests one with a feeling of undue share for our lives. I enjoyed this greeting and raw gray melt deep out of space. It strengthens a mutually exclusive sharing of the history of human encounters to the depths of pain, isolation, and intimidation of self and others. The result of our warm forgiveness forms a bridge away from muddy deposits in death we must meet. The birth of real people is a happy pursuit. This effort to realistically intersect with the dark earth of our bankrupt culture.
