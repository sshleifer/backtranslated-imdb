I thought this film was hysterical. I watched him many times and recommend it very. Mel Brooks, excellent. The cast was fantastic .. I do not understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I liked it .. I saw other movies in it and were also funny but this one really stick out to my mind because of the humor .. It I just can not say enough about this movie. I look for it to be about occasionally but it's never enough for me. People who play homeless people are not comparing them to their normal foliage too. Please put this movie more often. I can not see it enough..Leslie Ann Warren was another favorite to me, ever since Cinderella. I always thought he was not really funny but liked to act. In this movie she was very funny .. and he and Mel did a great job together. They should add more to their movies on TV.
