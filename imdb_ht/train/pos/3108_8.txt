This slurry greatly makes CIA look like a very crazy organization. In fact, maybe they are. After all, the road to the plot goes on so much that one person has the power to sanction kill everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of having killed the entire movie. She always tries to remember who she was & how she got where he is. She gets help from a couple of folks & it looks like every minute of the movie, someone tries to kill her. <br /> <br /> There is little time for the rest of this movie & sequence of actions to look very real. There are a lot of sequel chasing films and the unstable camera that in a way adds to the realism & makes it seem less Hollywood than many photos. These sequences add realism to the movie of feeling. <br /> <br /> The thrill of some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone will die or Bourne be head off. This type of suspension action is going to see when you want to be entertained & I'm sure this one will lead to the next movie in the series.
