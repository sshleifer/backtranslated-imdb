This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural much of it is accustomed to the winter, canoes, traps, hunting and the like. It's easy to get used to being granted but after watching this movie a few times he has grown up to me. The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadian credit director attenborough and scriptwriter Nicholson to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan doing well featuring a complex man, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is beautiful in her first great role. The remaining cast cast.
