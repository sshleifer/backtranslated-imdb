This movie starts out hilarious from the second 15 mark, and continues it throughout the movie. I can not recall a scene where I did not look at people who laughed at me. She is the perfect actor for this roll because of her style looks like her dress. The comedy party was great to see the actors are not very big or popular. As you can see people doing this movie she is now rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be at 250. Allow to put it in that way I have not seen this comic in a movie since American pie or the original vacation. See it if you want a laugh. I give this 2 big movie the up I've ever given since I found out on IMDb, great movie site.
