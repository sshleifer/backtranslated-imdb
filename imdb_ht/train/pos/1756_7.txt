'' The 40 year old '' 'makes me laugh. I do not care if he is considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed lots of jokes and scenes that are present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as Andy Stitzer's nine girl and I think the scene where Andy has her chest hair removed by one of the coolest waxes, especially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well-known or already famous, by the way. Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It's a little weird and collect many games, but looks harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends in his work, they discover that Andy is in fact ... maiden! And she is already 40 years old! After this revelatory surprise, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusions at which Andy gets in, especially now that he is really starting to love Trish, a woman he met when he bought a DVD player in the store he worked in.
