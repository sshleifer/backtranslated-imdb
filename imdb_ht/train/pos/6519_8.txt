This movie has great stars in the earliest years: Ingor Stevens never looked beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convinced Jean LaFitte, controversy over his piracy, and wants to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a great job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted. It's really a fixed flame for students to learn that part of our story, and it shows that all the happy terms that are not lovers are getting along with each other - sometimes the finest finish is that they sail away and find Partners in similar background will understand them better in the long run. I've seen it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and even though it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I like it every time!
