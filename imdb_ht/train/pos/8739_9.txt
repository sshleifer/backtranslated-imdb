This is a manure film. It has all the usual Disney elements (music, broad range of characters, stories, calls), entwined with superb animation and excellent voice talents of less well-known actors such as those of "Antz" and "The Price Egypt. " /> <br /> The characters really work well, and they have a strong call, and the humor is aimed at a wide-ranging win-win generational battleship. This film is also featured in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the movie experience. <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times, and I intend to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this movie on my recommendation and have not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction. Look at it, and do not get off because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you stay for the credit ends! Blooping and out-taking in the end is the funniest part of the movie, which is packed with laughter at all.
