This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for ages, especially for a war-based (shortly) film. Basically it is a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other things but the filmmakers say at the start that it is only coincidence if it is a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) went to crash on an airplane, he spoke to June (Planet of Kim Hunter Hunter) before he bailed out and said he loved it. He was meant to die from jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he is seeing and loving the body of the body. This elsewhere, like the sky, is happy because it has survived and meant to come to their world, so to send French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to convince her to go, but it is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he should appeal to keep his life in court in the other world, he is granted this. Needless to have love when the two lovers announced that they would die for each other, even the same offers to take place! Also begins Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as an angel, a brief (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as the Judge / Surgeon. David Niven was the number 36 of the 50 largest British actor, the film was the number 86 on the 100 Tearjerkers largest for the happy ending, the number 47 of the 100 major wars was the number 46 of the 50 British films bigger, and it was number 59 out of 100 bigger films. Exceptional!
