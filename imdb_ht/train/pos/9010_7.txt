A bit original and bitter bad taste; but smart enough to be worthy to look. A young Roller Coach Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is associated with a helpless caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist of daydreams in human robbery. He built an aircraft in his garage and intends to fly it. She wants to resurrect herself troubled by self-care, Jane's death, who suffers from a neurological disorder that has all but leaves her motor speed and very little. Wheelchairs-tied and full of spirits, last dead he wants to drop his girl. He offered himself Richard, who will not help him directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to make the deed. I found this ambitious and funny cops. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charismatic and equilibrium.
