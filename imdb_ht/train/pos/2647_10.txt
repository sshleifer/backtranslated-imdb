This film can be interpreted on many different levels. Do not listen to the other comments bashing the movie and say it is a story yet played or w / e and that it's just about drugs. It has many superficial metaphors over drugs; However, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally done) is really not about that at all. It is really mock psychology and conditioning in society. It shows, for a second split, that the brother's main character will watch people video online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all these gruesomenesses that we expose do make it easier for us to be mechanical in our profession instead of seeing people as human. As far as the logic scene, it is also reaching out to those who are in the federal binding class 1% smart that is confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and math and logical as it looks at a macroscopic level. You have to apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and uncertainty principles) by just physical but in life and leaving room to change your plan and adjust the road. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It just might go higher than yourself; It is not for you it is for those who have difficulty dealing with life does not work as a mathematical problem. Being critical to analyzing a movie or writing your critical review does not try to read the first back cover (written by market and parapsychologist)
