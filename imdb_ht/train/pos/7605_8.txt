Objects are a very nice TV set on some people who are lost on an island. There are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide what your favorite character is, a minute to read it then doing something so it's cool then shit on doing something so shy The suspense builds and as you are about to burst the episode ends with you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So you have to wait a whole week too to see the next episode but it is worth the wait. Stop, acting, romance, humor she got it all apart from the topless girls, but that's fine that means you can actually focus on the story more and story is that this is all about. So, if you like a good story and love thrilling this is a good one however 24 I think it's probably best. (I have a review on this also that you could check it out.) I would give a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it is unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
