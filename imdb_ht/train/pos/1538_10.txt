This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> Perhaps because I live just a few miles from the village the story has taken place, and I know how things work in this area of ​​Sweden. The movie says the truth, believe me! It both criticized and honored the form of Dalarna, and the producer wants people to watch the movie to be more open minded and care more for your closest friends and family. <br /> But if you live in another village anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you'll probably also recognize many of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
