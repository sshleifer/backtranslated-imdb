Ching Siu Tung's and Tsui Hark's A Chinese Holy History, aside from one of the biggest wuxia puppies ever to make, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as a prominent martial arts movie that should be Be part of the film's lover's collection. Without missing Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a travel tax collector who spends the night in a haunted house. While staying in the temple, she meets a colorful cast of characters including the Sword Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil, and the Ghost of the Beautiful Wrath of the Wrath seen, played by Joey Wong's beautiful. <br /> <To read it from the clutches of the Evil Devil Tree, it must reincarnate his body and travel through the underworld to defeat a demon even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Enough good thing can not be said about this movie. The rally is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the final feverishly rhythm should leave you with little chance to breathe. The chemistry between great tracks Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose career legend has ended too early) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Indeed, the act on the whole is so alive and full of life, I would say this is one of the most fun looking experiences I've ever made. Many of the credit goes to Wu Ma to paint it in mystical yin of extremists. Self-titled self-esteem in a devil sword has evaporated down on evil vanquishing to lead in some moments of great humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful note, suppressed cinema and eye-popping color, and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful movie. Get a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
