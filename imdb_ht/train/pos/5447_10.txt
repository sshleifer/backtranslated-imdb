Rules of personal taste when it comes to talking about movies like this little gem treasure. Way back to the eighties, the early eighties, I discovered this movie, as many released at the moment, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners" or even "King frat" artwork and blurbs on the back of tempting cover and tangled you. Of course, being at one age, such movies as I have already mentioned as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, captured the imagination, and fortunately many years later I still remember some and Romantic and some with the many film films that help keep my love in these genres as parody or pastich. <br /> <br /> Made many years after the great success of "Animal House" and saw how it has fared down in the years, I now know there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse The bucks in the box office find the aforementioned and would be delayed in the memory, much like that of the National Holiday Lamp. Honestly, not everything that brought the National Lampoon Logo was a wild success, however, I reunion classes remained one of my favorite movie ever, and characters immediately recognized, as the aloof Bob Spinnaker played in perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good at the Charles Tyrol's "Terrorism" is still persistent in past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst's bracelets and balsam as high school lazy sex at crazed Hubert Downs noise. Which makes me ponder. As I said, personal taste does not resist. People can be so cruel, so they will never have any awards or compare with their comrades in the comedy world. It does have some merit. They were one of the earliest scripts penned by John Hughes, who would later go to perform one of my own favorites in his work "Weird Science" as well as having a wonderful theme sung by the great Gary Gary US. <br /> What more can I say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.
