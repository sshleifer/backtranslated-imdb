Across the country, especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition, should take time out to see this movie. The movie is called "City Hall" with little imagination, its summary can take place anywhere in America. It's just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) and enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. People right-but it's none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) a bright person whose ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. All the points in this direction, until a police fire hinders an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilty points towards the city hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and a police officer blamed for a career of freelance career lead to a cover-up coverage by paying off-compromise policy and corrupt city that involves union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt officials corruption like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also involved is party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for probation office in New York. But it is the link between the mayor and his deputy who was taken to work by the accidental shooting. A great car for Cusack and a bet wager make sure to become a classic. ****
