I just finished watching the 138 version (widescreen) version with some friends and we were blown away. I will not bother repeating what others said. What the makers do and the concept is unexpected and fun. The big battle is tedious. Then we were stunned to find that there were still almost 30 minutes left, but that did not keep us from being fully involved and entertained. There is one thing that almost ruined it and that was the awful music / song. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads are not part of this and every time they used us all to burst into laughs. It's horrible. You have warned the story and tells stories to keep you sitting. <br /> There are several outstanding times that you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many silent use as well as slow-motion photography that works very well. I really wish I could delete the music but alas. <br /> Find out this. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to where you would not expect and that's very refreshing.
