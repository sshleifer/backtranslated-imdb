Rarely I see a movie that I'm totally engrossed; This was one of them. It has good action, dialogue, draw, and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed many times, especially the scene to deal with the kitchen attack. The slapstick comedy made by trumpet but made me the one floor, but I admit that I'm a slapstick pistons. The story was faced with a group of 30 people coming back to a summer camp that they were going to be 20 years earlier. It was a week I left camp, as the location could be closed at the end of the season. As the adult camp looked different, and felt differently about it and with each other. I recommend this funny, moving film at all. <br /> <br />
