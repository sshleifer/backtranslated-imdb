The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are things that Hollywood does not do yet. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive, and heart-felt movies that I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, deliver Oscar to perform caliber performance! No words enough to express how big this film is. Sure, people who are not in the sentimental cinema can not care as much as the rest of us on Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film goes right into the heart and sole of compassion for humanity. You will never forget this movie, EVERYONE! <br /> <br /> *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Eugene is an initial med-school that faces long hours and a workload required at the hospital. His British fraternal Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a little slower and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by his father. (A momentous heart then get out of the movie that will let you with tears!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") is facing a dilemma dilemma. He must decide whether to complete medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (a.k.a "Nicky") behind, or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay for school school fees when he works as a garbage collector. Ethical, moral, and responsibility questions are mastered in this landmark film. Just when Gino thinks Nicky might make progress toward independence, Dominick turns around and winds up doing things like helping a drug dealer, or tackling to use a defective code that he finds in the dump on an electric appliance. <br /> <Larry, the "character" with Nicky's partner on his garbage path is to fill Dominick's dangerous head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend is the Clinical Clinic lesson) going to Atlantic City and gambling all the money. But deep down, you can see that Larry cares about him. On the judges, Nicky also befriends a boy, whom we found out was also beaten by his father. An end result is also tragic and the pain that you see on Nicky's face when it comes to speaking merchants. The sensitivity of the two shares shared by each other can not be overstated. All Nicky wants to do is love and look for acceptance in any way he can. (she goes to church, loves Hogan Hills) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can her brother become self-sufficient so Geno can pursue her dreams of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gotten more gratitude than it deserved, but unfortunately came out around the same time as the Man of Rain, which faced a similar problem. However, I love Dominick and Eugene better because she has a more emotional element. You must be warned that this film is aimed at the good channel, so there is a handy Kleenex! What a movie !!!!
