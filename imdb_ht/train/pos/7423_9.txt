I just looked at the version of '54 in this movie with Judy, and while I appreciated the story with music, I found that the movie failed to keep my attention. I hope to see the '76 to be the same story, except with a barbara twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look of fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than '54 in one, and arguably better music, better acting, a longer, exciting line, and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on top of the 100 American listing of the Institute, while this refusal is missing a mark on the critical list.
