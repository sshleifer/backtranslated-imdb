Many comments on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. It depends on the kid. This is not a movie for a 2-6 year old; it is more geared towards the 8 years and older people. I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely love it. In the most animated time movies were a little too childish for my taste. This film deals with more serious issues, and therefore there is a little more emotional impact. In this movie character can die, and must be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters risk their lives. The good guys are not always perfectly sweet and beautiful (like other designs). They have "real" motivation, like revenge, and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
