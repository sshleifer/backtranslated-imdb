I loved Timothy Dalton very much though it was a bit young and too cute for Mr R. but I thought Zelah Clarke was too rough and short. This version however was very true in the novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R, though George C Scott did very well with it to launch up between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although they were both a bit too old for the role. Recently I saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca and Charles Dans and Emilia Fox. I would like to see what they are doing to Jane Eyre.By the time I got to watch the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I was Jane Eyred out, but I will never shoot at these first few minutes to hear Joan Fontaine's voice telling the opening of the first version I've ever seen. I always want to come back and read the book again.
