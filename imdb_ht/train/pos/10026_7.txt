San Kirsten Miller project does not have to end. However with the inspired inspiration and talent beauty that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. He looked as if the other actors were only playing in his strong performance. Wagner's attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not detract from being entertained. Particularly my criticisms with the written and drawn line, the group of talented assemblies did a heroic job to save what would be a disaster. Miller's charisma delivery and distribution were impeccable and credible. He plays that line intrusive and bossy, but never offensive it is in fact the structural engineer he claims to be. I wish I saw this on the big screen but misfortune I had to rent it before it was lost.
