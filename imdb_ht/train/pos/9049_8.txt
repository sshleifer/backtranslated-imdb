There is an old hard-to-speak movie with the new Vibrant movie by Joe Johnston who goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and who thinks he can not be both right." This is a very provocative statement refers to self motivation and belief in someone, which, in this movie, stands true even after road blocks and family problems stand in the way. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small coal mining town where almost every person grows up to a minor. All of her friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think their life after high school will be like everyone else. Homer does not arouse the future. <br /> One night, while everyone stares in the sky, a Russian space shuttle called Sputnik passes over. This is something new for Homer, and it finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on, looking at her life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, it tells everyone that he wants to work in the area of ​​rocket scientists for an occupation. Flabbergasted in what he said, his family passed this idea about themselves and continued to live as his usual friend, however, thinking that this idea might have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very smart person when it comes to this kind of stuff. <br /> <br /> When the four friends begin to test rocket models, and blow a smithereens white strike fence, then what seems to be a fire in their jungle fear, they are forced to finish their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances of this movie are absolutely fixed from start to finish. All of the actors give performance as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing in the Glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This pretty well can award Academy materials if the judges can remember back in the beginning of the year when this movie is released. <br /> <br /> Characters are also very well developed. Not only the films that provide clear, reason why calls Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain the audience how to succeed in the studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all the motives of their character and belief, especially the father, who bends over on eternal tradition. The movie, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum in the midst of points because of a comic, recycled romantic sub-sketch that involves Homer's love interest and how his brother stole him from li. This kind has become so awfully common in high school movies, not that this movie is aimed at high school. The actors stared at each other mindlessly, as they are in a vision. I put up with it without complaining in 1997 "Inventing the Abbots", but I was just about enough. <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With a real waiting time, movies are an Oscar and clips in Homer's real life and friends in the end, who all hit it great with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first big movie in 1999. <br / > <br />
