Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, was written by another centuries prisoner ago was a thriller of occult supporters and a surprising end to many suspense. Even though he had something in a play-theater (almost everything happening in the cell) he never got bored and he was acting very well. In the tradition of "cube" you've felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy and some of them are just changing your mind by torsion to the story taken. There are some things to capture you in guards and have always been a touch of insanity in the air. All along intense and fun and as I did not expect anything (a lecture friend), it was a positive surprise!
