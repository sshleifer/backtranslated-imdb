though this film is quite old, no matter how often I watch it, it always makes me laugh. <br /> One particular of the movie means. Danny (Joe Piscopo) pulls up Da's office & parks in a disabling place, Danny's partner says <br /> "Can not park here, it's for the disabled". I'm sick, I'm psychotic. "<br /> <br /> is one of the many lines in the movie that does not matter how many times you look, I'll make you chuckle <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerous standing in top 5 comedy / perfectly films of all time. <br /> As a bonus adds it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the cast. So watch this movie & love myself & many others Watching him, you'll be hooked.
