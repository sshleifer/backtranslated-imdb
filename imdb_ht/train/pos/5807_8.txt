This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for lovers Michael Jackson. He has a message about drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video. The main film is centered around the song and music video 'Smooth Criminal'. Contrary to the minute music video, it is normal speed and, in my opinion, easier to watch. The draw is rather strange, however. Michael Jackson plays a magical 'gangster' that, when he sees a shooting star, it transforms into a piece of cars. Throughout the movie, it transforms into a race car, a giant robot, and a space ship. <br /> <br /> The particular robot scene is somewhat drawn out and strange. I found it a little out-of-whack compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> A child is kidnapped, Michael is trying to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly becomes a giant robot who blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yeah. But besides the scary robot scenes, it's a very good movie, and any fan of Michael Jackson will enjoy both the video criminal list and the movie.
