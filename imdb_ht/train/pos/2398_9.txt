I really enjoyed this movie. It took a very dark story - this Macbeth Shakespeare - and wrapped it in an original, often funny and modern prize. <br /> <br /> Kudos in the way that the cinema brought the worlds very different in modern NYC and Macbeth to Scotland together under one roof. The world opposes the act <br /> really brings out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the choir, a part that does not exist in the play but really helps things jazz up. The ending meant from among the little indies I saw for its closure and originality.
