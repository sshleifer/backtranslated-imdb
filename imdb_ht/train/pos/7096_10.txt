I had the privilege of viewing this film in a screening year ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew at a local TV station looking for comments on the movie. At that moment, the only words that my mouth was "awesome. Just scared." I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was a bit incapable of doing so. <br /> The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the act is the first rate from all principals. This movie was the first one that Terry Gilliam ruled that he did not have a hand in the credit writing. Returning to Universal after its long struggle, which is really difficult with them about "Brazil", Terry has achieved what he wanted most; "Final Cut". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a very well-conceived painting that has been carefully built with determination and conviction. It is only fair that such a person should be infettered in his attempt to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limits still exist in these arrangements. DVD Universal Collector's Edition of this movie is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features are not listed on the box. It includes among other things, a audio / audio producer / audio producer and an informative and very interesting 90-minute documentary on making the film called "Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys". He says in some of the creative pitfalls of achievements, including a test of career screening test to test poorly, hit the team and feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little on the movie and drop it into an enormous success. <br /> <br />
