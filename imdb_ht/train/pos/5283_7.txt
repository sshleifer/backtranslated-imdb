First of all, this film is simple and is so the script: an elderly Muslim gets her son for driving her in the same old wagon from France in the haj of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that she can meet binding apart from being Muslim before dying. The father is clearly cleric, but the child is impressed; He accepted from his father's obligations rather than religion, he would rather be with her (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things that the son does not understand and the petition between them is the device that keeps the drama, although it is often rather irritable. However, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered on the road; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia that was asked for direction in Belgrade simply came to the backseat and point with his hands pronouncing a word that they assume to be somewhere, but can not find it on the map . In Bulgaria another person asked the direction to confirm it can speak French but then give a lot of extensive Bulgarian. There are also occasional humor - in one country tire sons of eating sandwich eggs and wants meat - they give a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slavery ceremony. They eventually do it in Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale. For Westerners it is all rare but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated but good in its own way, a kind of National Geographic and Soul.
