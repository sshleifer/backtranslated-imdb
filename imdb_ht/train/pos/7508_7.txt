Great act on the part of Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biopsy hit the screen in some time. While covering most of Bettie's young life, she also managed to stay on a particularly focused path that is something that most biographical films seem to be missing. Some nice and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting. This film is an excellent break from the Dir. in "American Psycho," and I think this will show off as her best work to date. Oh, and as a French cinematography, I give this movie 100% of the cinema dept. It was amazing how to pull off a 50s look with modern movie action. Hobby of D.O.P. All around very enjoyable. I recommend anyone interested to read: 8/10.
