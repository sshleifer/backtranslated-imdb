Masters of Horror: Right to die starts one night like mary married Abby (Julia Anderson) & Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) is driving home, however while talking to Cliff is to distract & crash into a tree that has fallen all the way la. The airbag cliff works OK & it goes away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby it was not & it ended up as toast when it was driven out of the car & doused in petrol that put alight burning all his body. Abby is life saved, just. He was taken to hospital where he is about life support seriously injured and horribly disfigured from burns. Cliff decides that he should die, his lawyer Self-employed Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks that Abby should die and execute the machine's machinery and get rich while Abam's Maman Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, to find wealthy & save Abby . However Abby has other plans in his own ... <br /> This Canadian American co-produced by Rob Schmidt (whose only movie horror has already been Wrong Turn (2003) on his own to his suffering paints a Masters of Horror Episode) & was episode 9 of season 2 in the Masters of Terror TV series, while I did not think the dead right was the best horror episode Masters I saw I thought it was a decent enough effort The same and still do not come close to being as bad as the Screwfly solution (2006). The script by John Esposito has a central central idea that is nothing new, but it uses it effectively enough although I would say it's a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes focus on elements of horror in the story, but then he goes to a minimum of 20 odd minutes as it becomes a dramatic aspect of the screams of Abby's life & Cliff in matters that have taken center stage before he gets on his track a delightfully gory & twisted climax that can not be for the faint of heart. The character is slightly clichéd, the weak man, the bent advocate, the protective mum & the young tart have sex to find what he wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves together a pretty rhythm & in general I liked the right to die apart from a few minutes here & there where it lost its focus a bit & I was not that keen on the finish limit. <br /> <br /> Director Schmidt does a good job and has some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between key spooky keywords & outdoors & out-gore & gore. Some fantastic effects make-up as usual, there's Abby vaccine where she has all the skin burned in her body with the image of her ankles and her teeth showing that she has no lips left is pretty gross ( image & make-up effect that reminds me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (1987) & it's the end), then there's the main course at the end of Cliff's literally a man's skirt and close-ups of scalpels Sliced ​​open skin & peeling it in the muscle & putting it in a cooler box! Very dirty. There are also various parts of outerwear. There are some nodding here as well and at least a couple of lovely ladies are getting naked ... .. Technically the right to die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters in her horror episodes she does not look like a good The make-for-television show shows that basically if the truth is said it is. The act was fine but there's no big 'no' in this one. <br /> <br /> Right to die is another fun & humorous twist Masters of Horror episode most fanatic horror would definitely check out if not only for the terrific dodging scene! Well worth a look ... for the stomach.
