Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did, I love this show! I think he was very well done with the thought. Everything about it marks it as a spin-off that does not mean to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody of other designs and one bad guy is trying to get the best of the good guy. By using well-known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters it is easier to engage the viewer and humor of commercial imitations from the start of every 30 minutes episode. <br /> There was always Scooby-Doo turn-offs that were annoyed fans. Classic were the scooby-shaggy scrappy buttons from the 80's. These turn-compromises had their place: New content was allowed to be sold, created new fans, and holding scooby-doo goods on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!" Do not fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what I've always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action packed show that focuses on the best / scratch-scooby-doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, attention to the details, the bad-guys, the "Best Friends" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Bad feature: None, although the Mystery remove machine is pretty close at times. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner browsing! One of the smart design in a long time!
