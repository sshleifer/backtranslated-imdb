This is, by all categories, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - movies are always sucked - this is art! The story of the Moon's Moon begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who is wrong what he came with life in refusal. She wants for final death to lead her to Mallepa, where refugees in several Asian countries live. Here, she meets Sho, an orphan living on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience that is based on the visual and emotional part of the film. He has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, aroused, sad, happy ... Never has a movie touched me that way this movie does. And the amazing actors - never heard someone speak many languages ​​without it sounding strange. A great praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> A recent comment on this brilliant film is that it stars Gackt (ex-vocalist at Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist at L ' Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent role as Sho and Kei. I am surprised at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting on how old he is to act out. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you have never seen any movie, watch The Moon Kids, The Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released Final Fantasy VII - Children's Show. All of the original languages, of course!
