Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on a true story posted in the Internet, but that's where the similarities are finished. The story is generally about this rebel guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman from a poor background, but happens to be the same age as her. Adding to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs still after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a curse, Thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, proclaims it for the lessons of the lessons, and you generally can guess the story whole. Did I mention it in a romantic comedy? This film has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spun, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of this reason. And I must say, I want to be a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than girls from "my sassy girl" (personality-wise, at least). It has some spun, but it's more about the beautiful, sweet, good-hearted way. Characters are already mostly unlikely (so one might say it was less of a hill to ride than "my Sassy girl" - an obstacle that worked for that movie in its credit), and the movie is well smart and interesting most of the way. The type of story of Zag, though, about 2/3 of the road (where it sort of treads on habit, fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it picks up a bit as yet. In general, a fun, beautiful movie. 8/10
