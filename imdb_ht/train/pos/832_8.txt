Interestingly, how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is to that of James Bond's romance novels when compared to the bond films. It's neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a boot womanizer. This is perfect break for him, even as much as they make fun of the bond icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself" she said. It does not get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is how much Ian Fleming described James Bond. Personally I never love Brosnan as Bond because it's fit the icon too close. There was nothing for him to personalize the character and, as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great view Brosnan plays a character both sat in reality and flamboyantly cut off the wall. A deep character tries to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological issues that it has no background to dealing with. It's an impressive painting, and with Greg Kinear in his ground is just poetic. This film reminds me a little of the dynamics established between the main characters of "Blue Sky", but more genuine in the survival mechanism.
