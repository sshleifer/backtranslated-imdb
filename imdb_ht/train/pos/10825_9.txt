Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a hard hit rate as far as TV works are concerned. However, his film work was much more expensive (2008 Job Bank was good, before the year passed decisively weak, for example). <br /> <br /> Still crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a great history, excellent performance, a lot of humor, fabulous music and, above all else, real hearts. <br /> I feel "momentum", and this movie has one of them - just when everything will be weight-shaped in the performance of the reunion festival ... <br /> <br /> Well quite enjoyable.
