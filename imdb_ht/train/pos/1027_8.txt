I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll just spout my opinion ... <br /> I liked this first set. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it seems, was the fifth-most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved out of the office field, the quality of the series suddenly fell into a cliff. I do not know whether Hammond was more important than I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****. Seven first seasons, though, were scared. The movie stargate seemed mediocrity first time I saw it, but it turned out, though this was not the original intention, a brilliant setup set. I recommend that you watch the movie first, then watch the first episode of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you will have a new new appreciation of it the second time around, believe me) , and then watch the rest of the TV series. The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the seven at first, but that does not mean they are wrong. It just means they're a disappointment if you've gotten spoiled in the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After you complete this series, be sure to look back the series, Stargate: Atlantis. It's a worthy successor for this brilliant series. <br /> EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found that Don S. Davis had died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
