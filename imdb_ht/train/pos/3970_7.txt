This film is on the surface would seem to be all about J. Eggar Hoover giving himself a big pat on the back for Battle of Clansmen, going after American killers, hunting the famous gangsters in the 1930s, fighting The Nazi in the US and South America during World War 2 and the New York communes during the early 1950s. Of course in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover's mania for keeping secret records of honest Americans, bugging people like Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., but worst of all, his secret love affairs with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about this topic, I suggest seeing Cohen's citizen film). Hoover aside, This story is a life of the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart for a decent, but dated movie. Vera Miles as her dedicated wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover controls production and always make sure that the FBI has seen without fail, Jimmy Stewart has given the movie a human side, quite a success considering Hoover was still looking at his shoulder. The background note is also nice. I read the latest online article suggesting that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and should not be one of her films to be forgotten. TCM is the latest network to show it a long time ago and I hope to show it again.
