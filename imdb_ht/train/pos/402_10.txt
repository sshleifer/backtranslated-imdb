I have already seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that movie, the environment takes place in China's hill, the Zuh Legend looks like another dimension! Thanks to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effect. It can show its visions in the mountains floating above the clouds, a land flying freely, and power ranging from razor sharp wings, sword split, and ultra fresh moon to the Orb. Many characters in this one, the focus is mostly on sky skies and enigmas. The romance aspect is there, although the film seems darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. At the beginning, I love how it looks like the Countess (from Zu Warrior) and it does well play enigmatic as it faced with past life faces. Oh, by the way, I mentioned that many Cecilia attracted to the eye? <br /> In truth, too warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard of cinema.
