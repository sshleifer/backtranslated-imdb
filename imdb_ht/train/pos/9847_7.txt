There was fun watching this film .. despite the feeling I got a lot of the time, that this movie was almost copying Monsters Inc. There are so many things that are very similar between the two, the relationship between a beast / monster and a toddler, other animals trying to break this relationship, etc. It felt like it pretty much all the movie, for me. <br /> One of these redeeming features though, is Scrat :) Very very funny character, though it does not serve any object :)
