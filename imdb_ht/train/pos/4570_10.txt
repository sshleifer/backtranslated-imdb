Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you have to love "my left foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis' performance in it). He plays cerebral paralysis-influenced Christy Brown. Because of that, he spent most of his life ostrakised. Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light of the darkness for him is that he has control of one part body: his left foot. He uses that appendix to paint and write poetry, bringing it into importance. <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration, and also on a later collaboration: "In the Father's Name" (but the "Boxer" was needed). "My left foot" can make you feel a lot: sad, hope, or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis has given the performance of a life here. A great movie in every sense.
