The film is directed by George Stevens.It set in India during the 19th century where three British soldiers have to stop an evil guru and kill her killing.Gunga Din is a wonderful adventure comedy war with lots of thrilling moments. The leading three are brilliant.Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (the legendary son you know who) is Sgt.Thomas Ballantine.Let do not forget other players fine including Sam Jaffe plays Gunga Din himself in a brilliant way.Fondane and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. She's awfully fun to look at the difficulties in Tommy's plans and Emmy's plans. Gunga Din is awfully very in fun.It can be funny, it can be typing. It can all be a good movie to ask for.
