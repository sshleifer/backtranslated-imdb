Anyone who does not think Bill and Ted's Travel Bogus is one of the greatest movies ever needed to be self-checked. It somehow managed to be both completely unruly and no-brainer, but also scary to know and intelligent at the same time. One of the rare films that actually improves on its predecessor, Bogus Journey can enjoy again and again. Notable release includes the duel and death and the finish, which is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all that Matrix garbage and get down to doing what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan of Bill and Ted: The Return.
