I have never heard of this movie before seeing it, I wonder if it was an independent movie, and I was wrong, but with a good cast I decided to luck it. Basically Drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the Rock Rock, Wyoming city, looking for a job, and meeting Wayne Brown's owner Bar (JT Walsh Pleasantville) giving a large sum of money, a mistake for a man-hit has hired to kill his wife Suzanne to turn his back (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, take the money, and go to warn Suzanne, and after making a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne realizes her real identity, she chases Michael to shoot a big gun, until he gets to a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realized Lyle is knocking-the man he made mistakes for, and he made a quick withdrawal. He goes to Suzanne, and they know they both are in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another hassle not to fall for each other. Prior to leaving, Suzanne insists to steal and steal a large amount of money in the safe. Of course things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up, and Lyle forces and now tied Wayne away and get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both find what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on a train moving together, but it's obvious he cares about the money and gets what he deserves. Also begins Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as truck driver and Robert Apel as Howard. Their performance, apart from perhaps a lame Boyle, is all fine and dandy, and has quite a good movie movie feeling for a black comedy comedy. Really good!
