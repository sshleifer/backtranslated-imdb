This film is of almost-defined importance to some of us born in the early years after the war (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved Saturday afternoon expenses in your neighborhood movie or home) certainly see it. And the memory saw it was probably left with you. It's style is the thing at a brief moment and somehow pretty interesting in our growing day. <br /> It has a modern, space-age storyboard for their audience in time. The set was any city with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a midnight show Friday. It has hot rods and young rebels, but in 'why they can not let you have fun' way rather than disturbed, histrionic rebellious-without-a-way way. All the characters have identified us - young people, parents, old people, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, the same cops - were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them all <br /> It was a terrible Singularman monster. It's the first victim to hear moaning 'it hurts ... it hurts' and we're convinced with fear. The threat continues to grow throughout the story. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, a fabulous lead to McQueen, and humorous moments, both intended and not. It even had an almost over-the-top part to make the tender most of us feel like crying. <br /> I've seen it in summer, ages 9 or so, double billing to company and 'I'm getting a Monster Out of Space Exterior', and being so thrilled by the experience of this particular dual feature has gone back a couple more times before he left. Everyone I saw. Everyone I knew she liked it.
