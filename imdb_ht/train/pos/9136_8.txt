This is not such a movie as some reviews, and as the summary of the IMDB page for this movie, say it is. Why? First, the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront, as one of the drawings elements, the problem of domestic violence - so re-complaining about the plot they sadly miss one of the main points! Secondly, without the elementary trace of Prince's film relationships with his abusive father, the tallest music point would not work as well as it does - so people are reassuring that only the music is good there, once again , missed one of the points - Especially, why it's so good ... because all of the music in this movie has a set of trace elements that makes the music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For the first time film producer and director, this is just not wrong! There are far worse movies out there in those films accomplished! And last, the reviews say that the music is "good" was missing the point - check out the series of stylistic music, the variety, the musician, and performances at the Prince stage - really one of a kind, go musical where no other person has gone during the 1980s, and a style seen from the work of other artists (clothes and movements: what costuming element came first, Michael Jackson or the Prince? Also, see if you can The dplayed spots dvanced rapidly before Prince performs in this film, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction"). As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all.
