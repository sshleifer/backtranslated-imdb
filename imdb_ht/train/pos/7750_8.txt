Barman directs the way the wind blows as it would sing a song dEUS. Anarchy rules on a logical and common strain of thinking. This story behind this movie just goes any way to blow the wind. And what can really be worthwhile to look, whether you're prepared with this desire. The viewers indicate that nothing to keep their story-line together is right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, bustling, where happens and any way to capture that feeling. It also captures the silliness, racism, bureaucracy, dependencies and violence that continue to live inaccessible to a seemingly friendly home. The movie is fun, funny and a little valley. Barman's first screen will not be as heavy as its first music. In this light, some might be disappointed. But then again, 'Worst case scenario' would be a subtle subtle for any way the wind blows.
