From these Pokemon films (which are in the best order of at least for myself): The Pokemon Movie First, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: The Untied and Unknown, this is probably one of the most important settings arguably, arguably the most beautiful and the most soothing one. If these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever," still have a lot of entertaining. <br /> As well as three points covered above, this pokemon movie includes good humor and good CGI (as well as animated). The time travel theme in the movie is represented in a great way with Team Rocket (the Funny Roulette / Baddies Roulette) ends with Gag quite well and finished being more main characters than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> The default, as always, the violence is unnecessary and the action and the baddie is very refreshing, even more so than a few Pokemon malicious films. <br /> <br /> A strange Pokémon being tracked down to a pokemon hunter in a jungle. A young boy is trying to save the Pokémon and takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty are joining a huge jungle ... Curious? Watch the rest ... Good for all Pokemon fans and fans of "American" animated film, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
