The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of films. He follows his own spirit through time, space, and character. There may be a draw, but I understand that I'm picking up the description on the Netflix DVD Flag. Honestly, it's probably best not to know anything about the movie before watching it, because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations. The movie requires that the viewer think, but also taunts the fact that he or she will not get complete understanding. The human heart is the enigmatic film. Each image questions his role, his nature, and his form. The heart is the intruder, those of the viewer and that of Louis. Louis' character is played by Michel Subor and the peace and mystery required as a character. Honestly, anyone could have played Louis' character, whether he or she owns a lost, unwanted, and comfortable heart. But Subor is the one here; she gets the movie, her identity is inseparable from her. Many of the movie's images persist in my mind revolve around his expression, vocal, but mostly physical. <br /> <br /> The intruder is poetic in its ability to take the silence and fullness of movement, but more than any literature in its form refuses to take. "Surrealistic" was a term used to describe this movie, but perhaps "quasirealistic" is the most appropriate term. Nothing in the movie exists outside of the possibilities of reality; Simple omnipresent notes confirm that do not imagine the music connection between heartbeat and dim light. <br /> <br /> Look at the trailer a few times if you are attracted to visual imagery; watch the movie to see the consequences of the combination of verses and a thrilling freedom.
