A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get locked off the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the movie awaiting what the destiny will bring to the characters. This movie let you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you through, it makes you part of the story ... costumes and the brilliant settings; Especially okayas districts are skillfully built. He is definitely not very Akira Kurosawa, however he always gets a lot of master, especially the storyteller story telling us in a distinguished country in movies that is far from hollywoodish flamboyance.
