This is a great movie. <br /> I agreed to watch a chick movie and some how ended with this. I've never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet Mike from friends). <br /> But it is great! Eva, Lake and Paul provide amazing performances. The humor is always dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd pretty much plays the mike character out of friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and the scheme is formulaic (I mean we're not talking about 'Apocalypse Now' here) but the characters are unmatched, the story is engaging, the band, production and direction all work well. /> In all a great feel-good movie that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets. Everyone has their own taste, but I really do not understand the single star review for this.
