Excellent Warner Bros effort begins starring Errol in one of his best screen performances. He often quoted as his best, and I can not really judge fully until I saw him "Dawn Patrol". However, his work at "They slept with the boots" took some beat. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps he's an Aussie) and I think he's just wonderful, a great screen presence and also a great actor. He is the central to "Mr. Jim" as the legendary boxer and the fancy footwork, but he was also supported by a literary, hot and comic script, and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen never loses a beat in its speed, it's truly a movie-maker that was born. Walsh directs the ring scenes very well, as it does with the lighter and intensive moments, the great final stage between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to that huge production value (the "Gay nineties" never look better!) And a nice throw to support and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Alan Hale plays Flynn's sidekick, but here's his father, and he's still working. Alexis Smith is Flynn's favorite interest. The pair is head on the heels of love and fight each other.
