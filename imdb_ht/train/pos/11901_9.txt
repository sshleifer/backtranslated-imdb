As far as I can remember, Balanchine's change in Tchaikovsky's notes are as follows: <br /> 1) The final section of the Grossvatertanz (a traditional melody played at the end of a party) repeatedly repeatedly gave the children one Dance before the scenes are over. <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for hand eliminated from Tchaikovsky's notes for the Sleep Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the stage scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its tune-up relationship in the music for the Christmas tree growing shortly thereafter. 3) The solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy Cavalier is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine was somehow desperate to Tchaikovsky's high score is misplaced.
