Mesmerizing, enchanting and anxious, this hauntingly beautiful film is the "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slow in speed, quiet in mood, it gives good views of the poisoned plates on Earth that can be quite a sign of an inevitable bankruptcy. There is no doubt in my mind - the nature is plagued and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that leads evolution and progress, has turned us into something like cancer, on its way to consume the army and die with it ... <br /> <br /> Manufactured landscape is quite a look Unforgettable experience - at least I never considered my taster and did the same again.
