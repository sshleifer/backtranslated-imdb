I think a lot of people just write this off as another of the Tom Cruise's unusual movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Locked), but Vanilla Sky is definitely its own movie. Many said it was strange; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is the Truman Show. Confusion is the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, perhaps not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. This is the point. This is what the so-called "weird" revolutionary turn came in. If they were bothered to "open their eyes ["] as the original 1997 Spanish movie, they would see it. But if not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful band; It uses it to put the "feel" - that is noteworthy that many films are missing. With songs such as the "Boys Vibration" Boys Beach, the biggest and emotional play of the movie, it creates an offbeat but amazing "right" feel. A wonderful movie, in its script, music, acting, and image, Vanilla Sky is sadly, a superficial motion movie that criticizes chide in order to appear intelligent. Excellent: A +
