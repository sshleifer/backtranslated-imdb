The Invisible Man is a show everyone has love! He reminds me of the 80's old school series (a team, airwolf, knightrider) Special effects are small, but very effective !! but most importantly it is fun to shoot this series. It really shows! Throw at all the perfect fit of having a role and it seems they can do whatever they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! for her incredible that a very sarcastic actor is her acting status not to get a shot in a big movie (Mr Tarantino has shown you should be headed! instead of serious serious seriousness (csi)) Find this show if you can. well worth it !!!
