I love all the versions of this story but this one is my favorite ever. George C.Scott gives a depth of character to Scrooge that others do not give. The movie shows more about why it gets so bitter. The changes in Scrooge seem gradually as it encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that are shown to him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tim far. It is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager like in the other films. Anthony Walters always has all or most of his baby teeth. David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. It's like a versatile actor. It shows a good man who loves his family. He plays the role and dignity both as a wimpy cowering man under Scrooges'thumb but as a graceful person set up with him because he has a family to provide for. Susannah York and other actors make a great job of bringing their characters into life. Edward Woodward is the best of my Christmas gifts ever seen. Most often it is played as a character character Santa. In this it shows anger in scrooges and really makes Scrooge reconsiderate. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really bring London to Dickens time in life. A wonderful movie.
