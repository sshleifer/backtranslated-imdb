HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror movies in the past decade. The draw of the sub-original and the main draw is even better. Special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any roles that come his way. <br /> <br /> Claude Rain shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933, right now, Kevin Bacon was shocked * us * and HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever. The action is intense and the thrills are true. You can actually get yourself jumping if you're watching it in the darkness of a night time. Thrust in support includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg, and Mary Randle. Everyone does an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to make an invisible person. After animal testing, they move on to human test. But someone has to be the subject. Volenteering, Caine is invisible. But when his team can not bring back visibility, Caine is mad driving by his condition as he seeks his revenge ... * end of crowds * <br /> <br /> The movie created memorable trauma sequences and is the destiny to become a classic well in the next century. Become the basis for a parody joke in PHOTO MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you in the throat and never let go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow, develop the characters and show how their experiments work. The second half is interesting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks to a crazy invisible man. Then change the water into fire and blast. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... YOUR OWN becomes 5/5.
