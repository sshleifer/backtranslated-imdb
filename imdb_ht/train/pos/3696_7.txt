Although I live in Minnesota, I've been studying in France recently and came across this rare film into a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, to say the least. A creative and unique film, the different directors each lent something different and their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try every one of these little stories in a general storyline, as much as they can do with the 2003 Love Actually. This tries, however, to render magic in every obsolete individual segment. Given the nominal value, and each of the short segments taken as its individual films, the stories love together tell a nice message. The film is tapping rare at times - often at the point of confusion - with each individual segment being difficult to follow.

It adds to the reality of the movie - here, Americans speak English, French parishes, and so on. The number of people who encompass the movie leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> From diseases of the supernatural, the love of parents loving their husbands, this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and original way, every unique event somehow falls into a place of telling a story: what's in all sorts, sizes, nationalities, and forms of love.
