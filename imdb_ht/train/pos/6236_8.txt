The conspiracy conspiracy is about as light as feathers down. But the advantage here is the boy and girl classical refusal we became accustomed to in the "Gay divorce" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the typical casual friend, the duo dancing are the former lovers Baker Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since day dancing. <br /> Of course, being a 30s music, there's the problem of understanding romance, stylish stitching and the slight irritation of a sabotage audition and soda bicarbonate has cost something ginger rather than special. Then, in the grand tradition of financing diminishing, nothing is best for Hollywood's best venture than to put on a show. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of fun from Irving Berlin to pour through the show. Top hat and evening dresses are saved right up to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are coming out again in the charm of the world ... and the marine charm. Everyone and everything is once more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Earlier shine at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know he's got to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
