I decided to look this because of the recommendations from this site. I should say it was worth the effort. However, you should be careful that this movie will go on for about 210 minutes. If you do not have the power to stay, get it on the tape and watch it on a couple of nights. <br /> Now in the movie, what I say will include "blame" and if you do not yourself, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promising bum, a womanizer with a gigolo. She lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and provides for Alex. Alex spends his day in coffee and restaurant. The story reveals that Alex was already impressed Gilberte whom he used to live with. Gilberte threw it to a less attractive person that he did not like because Alex was abusive and beat him. At that point, Alex wanted to get a job and helped raise his children before he found out Gilberte had been abducted and planned to marry another. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets a steamy nymph called Veronika and striked up a relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid gender she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika are fighting for Alex's affection and has a toilet seat boot. Finally in the end, she's revealing Veronika is pregnant with Alex's son and Alex asks her to marry her. We assume (like Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new love and family. Have hope! So, with the title "La Maman et la Putain", I deduct Jean Eustache was related to the character Françoise Lebrun of Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. So, the mother and the whore are the same person? Anyway, what I know! The French films are mostly (not all) highly sought after, politically ill, preaching, theater, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played their faulty characters and kept the movie together as some parts of the script became a little lost and disoriented. <br /> <br /> Not a bad effort. 7/10.
