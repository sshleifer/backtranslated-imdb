I kept this movie late on a night / Sunday night with my brothers. We drank. This is one of the best films for the crawler I've ever seen. From the lick 'luxury' liner actually was a 'roll over, rolled' ferry, filling and dropping to do everything in the doors and adhesive stickers to tell their staff, then seeing the same door they were used for something else in another scene - this rock movie !! The continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, and hit you in the face and the holes. At the final stage she jumps on a lifetime boat and ferry in the distance. Pruning her son with a new girlfriend (pirate ship director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed to make things way - true) on the ferry will be very soon away from the explosion. ...... Then the father has to embrace them. HoW ???? Who cares about his magic. There is not one feature of this movie. The casino is the size of a large room with one casino table. When they were chased by bandits they had only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the bandits that, instead of checking under the One tab, continue to shoot four fruit cars and a corner corner (a corner corner of the casino - fantastic). They walk just like the only hidden place so let Kasper find them around and 'take them out'. <br /> Find some peers on, get a few drinks in, put this movie on and plain.
