Perhaps I am with my perverted way, or the fact that I tend to have a very sick idea, but I rent this movie at random one very strange and big surprise I enjoyed it. <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and it was banned for 25 years and calculated I was prepared for anything he would offer. I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything, cutting a long story short. I can see why it was forbidden, not only for the explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality. <br /> Of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, a personal favorite to me, she tells the story of a girl's sex up on a dream about a Duchess being run Behind not a hell-that-hell-that-stuff-like-like creature with an enormous ship and a substantial amount of culmination. Of course, the animal gets what he wants and the Duchess decides he likes it and continues to frolicking in the woods. <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there are so many more! <br /> Not only do we get to see interspecial sex, but there's also dog humping, the babysitter gets down and dirty with the slave when he does not humping the bed to get it ... he ... satisfaction with girl the daytream masturbating with rose petals. Creative <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> when watching this movie: make sure you are the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains close. It can be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like this one.
