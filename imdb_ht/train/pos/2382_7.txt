For a long time, the 'Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipse by 'City on the Edge Forever.' What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it's the most difficult-core Star Trek and this fascinating fascinating story of the storytelling story then-right now. I still think it's fairly ingenious way Gene Roddenberry incorporates the original pilot into a two-part episode. Though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and some others (and we) to watch the pilot, the idea of ​​spock-martial spock is a smart one. You can spit holes in the draw if you want. For example, given the Talosians' self-control capabilities and the Captain Pike condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to the planets? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think too hard on the details and just enjoy the only two-party ST.
