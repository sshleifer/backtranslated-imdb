I will not repeat all that has been said by other viewers in this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this is an excellent film, not only as a very human story of the relationship developed between a father and his son, but also as a small window on the world of practicing Islam, for people like me who are not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of young people's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude to the religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them. Well-designed films that I would recommend for anyone with brain and heart.
