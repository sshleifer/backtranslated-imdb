In New York, the family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his senior colleague and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely man and disrupted after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has the problem to discuss his innate feelings and his wife. Alan retires his friends with Charlie and gets close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending it to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Book Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and sent to the court. <br /> <br /> "Reverend on me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11th is irrelevant to the field; it could be a car accident, fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by Gorgeous Saffron Burrows, of Alan. But the drama family works, supported by the great performances Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Tyler's book is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know if it's using too much make-up to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine About Me"
