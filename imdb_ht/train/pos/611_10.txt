I'm convinced that people who are ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie are completely blondered. NO ONE I KNOW wanted to see this movie based on the forecasts, and everyone who actually saw it (I know) absolutely loved it ... Advertising campaign is disappointed / disaster / blonde. in # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush And which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-Bourn of Ultimatum, which I saw, awesome movie but 3 weeks out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (worthy of being said). The # 3-Simpsons Movie, which I saw, okay movie but 4 weeks out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). # 4-Estel, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn, but this was us for 3 weeks). <br /> <If it was poor schedule or poor advertising I think that the powers that must be behind this movie up the great time! This should be published as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairytale and not published as just another fairy? Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I had a lot of free on-and-on ... Awesome movie, go see it!
