This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst-directed movie and I enjoyed them more than his most famous movie starred Louise Brooks (like the BOX PANDORA). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that Italians are perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This film style calls for the use of non-actors (just tip types) in daily settings in order to create intense involvement with realistic films. In this case, the film is about minor French and German miners, so similarly, people in the roles seem like minor - by actor. The central conflict as the movie starts is that there is a big mine that is located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big one, he divides into the border with German workers not welcome in my French, despite being the biggest unemployed in Germany. This, the difference in language (illustrated beautifully in a dancing scene scene) and WWI bites to create a great rift between the factions - causing us against the mentality. Later, an explosion caused a huge thaw in the French and German to refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove to be true compassion between the miners and men in general. The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get German hearings to see the inertia of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously moving movie and some of the scary images and claustrophobes I've ever seen. Considering history, though, the impact of the film was the best minimum. It's a real shame, like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (GANCE) and ALL QUITT on the Western West (Milestone) had great peace messages and harmony but ultimately were the failure to positively balance the public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.
