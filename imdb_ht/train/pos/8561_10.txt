When two writers make a scenario in a horror version of Tiffany's Breakfast, you know something that will go right. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope, and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes where Patrick watched Holly up and down as some sort of goal, these were just strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate aliens, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big party. The strange worm was just weird. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was scene where Patrick followed Holly in a cesspool and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What did he do to fumbling around in the? And not every man has a girl, as Sally Kellerman stated. But when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew out of the Victor, that was strange.
