I really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between the Americans and Japanese women in Japan's post-war - as well as the preconceived obstacles created by them. Brando goes to have contempt for the Japanese (which is considered natural WW2) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is okay (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is wonderful at all. Red button received an Oscar to earn his performance in another GI that fell in love in Japan (though Japanese women who played opposite him also did a remarkable job). <br /> I do not want to spoil it but the movie is good to watch with a box of tissue. <br /> <br /> This movie managed to tell somebody and be fun at the same time. A large part of the ground.
