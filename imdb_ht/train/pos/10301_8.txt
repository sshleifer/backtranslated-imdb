Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best photo since ... well ... a long time. He has one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time too ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even ships in a few surprisingly funny jokes. It has one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but on all a great movie and some funny scenes. The best scene, it is where Jim is messing up the human voice at the anchor. <br /> Rating: 8/10
