I sat with my children as we watched this movie. We all find it to be a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth class is intimidating to start things with him and this is what leads to the food of glass. <br /> A bet made with Billy has only very much time to eat 10 glasses or others. From this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook, fry or cook the worms to try and get Billy sick so that he will lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy remains strong and feeds her way to becoming more and more loved by all, even friends of bullies. <br /> I do not tell you if he has the bet or not ... you'll just need to look it in to find out but i'm thinking that if you love the good family movies you'll love this one. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have daughters and they really loved it very much.
