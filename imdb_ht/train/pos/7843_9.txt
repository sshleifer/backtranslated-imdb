I can not believe that this was taken in the air. Specifically, when only there were a few more episodes left. My daughter, sister and some friends I liked to watch this. We were so upset when they stopped showing that because they called the ratings. It does not just give the people who watched this show from the beginning. We could see the end. I wish they would take a general vote of everyone who has a 3 times a year voting system. They were able to send paper in our mail and as our viewers could give a general vote on any program we watched or heard about. This would also help promote a new show. People would see it and ask what it is. Not only would you see what viewers are watching, you could also use this as a tool for free commercials for TV and cable channels. We want to see other episodes. Bring it back!
