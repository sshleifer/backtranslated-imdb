"A Timeout Itch" is one of a rope home run Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940's, including the `Horton Hatches Egg 'and` torture wins by a rabbit.' The thrust of manic distributions and exaggerated destruction, it's basically legendary in a bug in hiding land for a new home, and the dog has the ground broken. Because Elmer's master will give him a dreaded pool batteries if it's so much like scratches, the unlucky caterpillars are forced to hold a spiral upstream of torment like the homesteading flush using pick-ax and clear power tools' land. Finally, the little monster light fuse in a mountain of high explosives he piled up behind his victim! There's a tremendous explosion, and the haporous pig covers his eyes as the end of it erupts in a fourth corner of the July display! That really has hurt, and the dog flees, but quickly he stops the action and says with a happy smile, "You guys better cut it out, 'cause I think I start to love it!' This year's artistic connotation was monitored, but now imagery has restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devil's glory. Still off, however, the gag is locked in that cat's neck 'Out after it frustrated, `Now I've seen everything!' This was a common gap in WB, but it has since been purely out of this cartoon with several others, including `Horton. '
