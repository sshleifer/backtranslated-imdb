House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. It's a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. She is blessed with wonderful performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, with a strong, strong cast in supporting players, and introduces Ricky Jay, extraordinary sharp cards, prestidigitator and historian of magic. Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, speaks as if in a game of behavior and gives the film (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealistic. <br /> <br /> On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing glimpse of the unknown world of cheats and people, different diameters from the sting, played simply for glamor and yuks. At this level it succeeds admirably. However, you can not escape the test at a deeper level through the odyssey of a woman from competent professional skills of incredible strength and self realization. The only movie I know of which treats the theme of the emergence of personal strengths in a woman's worthy way is Benjamin's privacy. That film is very enjoyable unfortunately broadcasting its focus, jumping through several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn chasing after some easy laughs. The game board game in its business. As Poe once said in a good short story, he drives relentlessly to his conclusions. There is another strain of cinema-on-the-women, featured by Thelma and Louise, a big budget maker making money and despicable terms that women finish, if you do not realize their inner strength. What is floating. <br /> <br /> As usual you really have to watch this movie in a movie theater. It should be a natural for film festival. Nominate it for a close or if you get the chance. <br /> I bought the original version of the game House and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Its best to see it on a TV than not all.
