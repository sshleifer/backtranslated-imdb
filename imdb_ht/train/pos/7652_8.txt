Aji-fantastic. The story - amazing. The script-wonderful thing. <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and it's mostly talk, but the whole story of all life and how it is said and the flashbacks are thrown in and out making you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story . I, I, read the book that the movie based on it showed me more light in this story and answers some questions left unanswered in the movie. I also sing the song Exectioner, which is 'other' half of the Gilmore story. This film makes me think a lot about the phrase "pierced to the other side of the mirror looking". You hear a song in the film called Gary Gilmore in Eye, which is not a lot of punk who wrote a song about what he would like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary was given as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal ever saw Gary, you look at the whole situation somewhat different if you were only here singing in itself. This movie opened my eyes in this way and in many others. I recommend this movie (with the book) a lot.
