Not knowing anything about the movie before watching and I think it was "no expectation" factor that helped me endure in first and later as it more than I anticipated. but interesting. The scenario was gaps / jumps that I think launched the audience in a bit. There is no big band playing in the background, creating the "romantic" ambiance. But they did not have any problems. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There were some inexplicable unusual chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with her and here I, wrote this review. Often love subtle by the two actors was superb, and I believe, that's the core of this movie. This movie is not a romantic comedy everyday; In fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I sat shortly and then quietly began to understand my little things I did not catch at first. I can not guarantee everyone will love it, but I hope you do.
