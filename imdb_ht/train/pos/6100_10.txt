This is a really funny movie (and sexy) - which is not only funny but has great acting. It's kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I found myself often laughing loudly with everyone else, and also moved by some of the most serious movie films. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as really really funny - the more dialogue is great. Character Wood Harris' has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their role. If you get a chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
