Did not know what to expect from this movie to consider its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it did not disappoint. <br /> For me one indicates the final episode with the American tourist has talked to a French French accent (which made me feel better about myself) that was actually well handled with a great way to wrap up movie in. <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stabbed victim was also very moved and for the most comedy Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi taking the award. The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope. However, the Bob Hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire history was completely farcical. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section also felt compelling and Chinatown's history was completely incomprehensible. Throughout this film is worth looking for the good bits and has a strong finish. It's not too painful to sit in the bad sections - they are just the last 5 minutes anyway. <br /> Can you punish !!!
