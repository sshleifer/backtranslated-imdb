Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of jail when the movie starts. As soon as she walks out the gates, she immediately starts working on a plot once again to make a package by stealing, even though this time she has sights and puts very high. This is actually one of the weak points on the movie, as it apparently knows nothing about computer (some made back in 1968) but managed to become a computer literally overnight! Yeah, right. Anyway, it comes with a conspiracy to imitate a computer expert and find a job with a great American corporation so he can eventually jerk a ton of cash. Considering its computer knowledge is rudimentary, it's amazing as it puts in effect a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate its computer and its computer system. But it is a movie after all, so I could stop disbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to run with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> At the very end, though, it gets very confusing and Smith announces he has managed to actually accumulate over two million dollars by clever investors in the companies that Ustinov started (though he does not did realize they were all online companies). This would mean that eventually the actions he bought were worthless. What do they seem to mean (and I might be wrong wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partner quickly grab money from the previous actions became known and their actions would then, become worthless. Either way, the movie seems to post on a magical end how no one hurt and everyone is happy - and this just did not make much sense. It's a shame, really, as the act and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just beautiful. <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, as the movie looked very much vague in detail at the end.
