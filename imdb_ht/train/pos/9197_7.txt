This is actually a pure-clean little-fledged film, made on absolutely no budget discrepancies and injected videos on video. He took a moment to warm up. The act is so bad that it soon buys a hook-like charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the left or sound lines that have been repeatedly delivered. The characters all develop an original charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I would hire to play a raven psychopath. It just seems to enjoy it for so much! The mix and scene of mad-slasher warfare and zombie infections are some really visually effective shot of the title character, "midnight skater" zooming at the campus in a black hood, looking for the whole world as a cross between Grim Reaper and, say, the Silver Surfer. These vaccines sometimes make these funny characters say about the skater looks almost ominous. The soundtrack features some very fun garage-punk and raspy, ranching in what she may well with the movie's mood. Thumb up and I say.
