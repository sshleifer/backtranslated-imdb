I believe they have told the truth at all ... you can not believe anything in the wild ... Their relatives go to hell. These poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them. But still have to deal with rumors. As well as dealing with the loss of the younger sisters. I cant believe this case went on for long.seems as the jury could not see the truth, though it bit on the donkey. I feel for this family, and if I could let them know I hate what happened to them, I would. I have no idea what to go through, I cant even imagine it. After watching this movie, I was in tears, and was checking over my girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch this.
