I watch Cold Case because of real-life experiences are shown. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so kindly handled, thanks Merideth. All the characters well developed 3D mainly Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far beyond the developed nations of the world. Only this type of honest experimental painting and treatment makes an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things similar, but I urge that 3/4 of the people were voted at the bottom of the 30 crowds voted similar to me10. you will reach those difficult - I will forever reserve the "best episode" where for this episode. Please continue to be lucky and accept my sincere gratitude.
