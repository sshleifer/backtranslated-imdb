It's no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavern, this movie is also a poor decision, but one I enjoyed completely. The first 5 minutes are the most uninspiring 5 minutes of any movie; sweet, bad dialouge, and then with a Spiderman position, Busey yells the best-worst line in any movie ever created ... "Worst nightmare of the menu!" I coughed up some of my eggs I laughed so hard. Line the right line right, it's even the worst claws "hi freeze, my Batman" line. Other Classic Times is Busey constantly angry for the person who reminds him that he has received his former CIA partner to kill him ... that he did not accidentally shoot him in the chest (all made possible by a slow down sequence slowly making it look like dry paint looks interesting). There's an ashtray in the nads, punches in the face, and a "that was not my fault and you know it!" Well, the foot shows him to miss the bad guy and hit his friends, so ... Other shouts out-loud moments to be ex-girlfriends her friend thrown a grenade to the ground to enable him to escape '- a plan that challenges all logic, physics, and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during the intense guerrilla warfare and starts running with a small object, I'm almost wet myself. Some of Busey's best jobs are near, rent or buy it today "Butthorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (about meter poo who is).
