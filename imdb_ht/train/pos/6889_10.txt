He asks you to look into your own life and confront themselves obstacles such as Lou eventually do. He asks you to overcome the fear perception and become who you want to be. Carr Bridges hold up a mirror unlike any movies there. The intent and the message is clear and profound. People's awards on this film are only out of their own insecurity. An open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it. Sometimes a life-changing realization comes in a flash - a light bulb goes on.
