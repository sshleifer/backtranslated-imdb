Another very flick man flick man in the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedy awareness of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). It's to see that the man is less likely to take the fork ride or bend. "You're Wrong Mr. Dunston". Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he can not be deserted by Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway and respect due to the trapings of justice on the reality of it. Another key theme is helping people and in turn that they have helped by people. The sperm can make and suffer for it. <br /> <br /> The caption above plays on Tatum's statement that he can not live without his coffee. This addiction nicotine proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> I recommend this movie and now its own DVD.
