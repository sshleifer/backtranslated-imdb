Give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors in their time-Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this movie + director Herbert Ross, and all that make this stage adaptation come true. The Sunshine Boys are one of the best films in the 70's. I love the humorous style of this movie, it just makes me laugh that hard. <br /> I got this movie about VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper-only $ 3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to look it again because I was holding a few parts first. The second time I looked at her, she felt a lot better, and I laughed a lot harder. I definitely will re-get this on DVD because I've seen the special features. <br /> It's very funny how it happens. Two people work together as actors / actors / performers. They get well on stage but really discuss the scenes, they can not survive another minute, then some 15 years later, you want to meet them for a special TV. You can find that in this movie. Matthau & Burns was terrific in this movie. It's a damn shame to die. George Burns deserves Oscar. He gave a strong comedy performance. It was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, she is the oldest actor to receive an academy award of an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic. He won a Golden Globe for the best actor to support. It deserves Golden Globe. Although many people can agree with what I say, everyone in this movie has been giving a strong performance. This Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. Another thing: Anyone hating this movie is a "Putz"
