This is a ridiculous film of ridiculous film that captures essence in the middle of late 80's mania and how metal metal metal supposedly was. I can remember being freaked from young metals when I was a kid. It does not help that I found a grave dezesport in the cemetery of my town when I was ten. Turning out this metal kid has been digging up some old bodies and using the bones of some satan satirical sacrifices. So maybe things like discouraging me from metal for a while, but I like it now, as a 24 year old. <br /> I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I hope it sucked due to the lame cover, but in my surprise, she headed. It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you have to love a scene where a guitar shoots laser and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. This movie is scary, if you like 80s metal and bad movies, this one is for you. 9/10!
