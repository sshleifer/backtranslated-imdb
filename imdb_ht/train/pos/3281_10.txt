Who would have thought that such a dark film can be so haunting and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a shame that more people have not seen it. I liked, as always, Hans Zimmer's notes. And what a first director by Bernard Rose! But I wonder if I should call this a horror movie. He could easily argue that he's a fantasy or a drama too. Well, regardless, I love the potential interpretation it has. Everything and everyone in the Anna (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams represent a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the brand, the lighthouse, etc. It is the very details like those that do The movie is so good to see again. I hope I come across a little movie as loaded with emotions and psychological significance as this a short time soon.
