Once you choose your cheeks you rise from the floor from the realization that they ... somehow ... managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released in the same year the case ended, you're find that it's not half bad. The plot is engaging and exciting, and the rhythm is fast, and this is very much covered, and so often jumps rapidly over to the next after a line or two spoke. Where this really means out is the acting. Their performance is excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It is also very common that many Australians speak in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally in it at least try an accent. The camera and the corrections are nice enough, but they do not really go beyond the standard thing. This film story is compelling with the fact that it is authentic just to make it all the more refrigeration. While I was not reading the novel or hearing about what happened out of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. Some moderate in strong language and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a dramatic dramatic drama drama. I recommend this to any fellow fans. 7/10
