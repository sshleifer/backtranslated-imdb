This is standing in bust up I've ever seen and I think it's boring I'll ever see. If you do not choke and laugh at the sheer hilarity, then this is just not your cup of tea. But I honestly do not know anyone who saw this who did not like it. It is now 17 years later with my friends and I always quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the Fart game, Aunt Bunnie of the ice cream man, Ralph and Ed are found! There are just so many people and collective skultur of hilarity in here that if you honestly did not see this movie then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, bones, George Carlin or even grandparents like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass it.

You look cute warriors in their jeans .. Now come over here, and f @ ** me!" <br /> <br /> The crowds erupts in street laughter. No one expected the lounge mouth that he unleashed on. But the results were just scary. I've never been barraged with comedy the unlucky way I was in this stand-up. In fact, when in the next stomach I hurt many of the laughs was not until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: Bigger Time with UNCUT. That comedy was raw and unapologetic and went for the jugular, as FE Deli. I do not think it's possible to watch this piece of funny stories and not laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still funniest humorous about this video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids fishing last week .. And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put poles back into the boat and cried themselves in the water for two minutes Gus .. The kids do not make shit like that Gus then began to movin themselves around like this with the **** f ***** up and fish, when That's to look at each other, saying Goonie Goo Goo! I said you can believe this from **** n? "Look at it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
