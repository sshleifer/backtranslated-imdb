This is one of those movies that I've seen many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching her stumble and falling while drinking, going out to drink at fancy restaurants and party with the Moose. <br /> I do not know how many times I saw this sequence but it's funny every time. From that moment Arthur gets to Susan's father in the bit with the Moose, you pretty much laugh at the whole time. I remember watching it out about the bit with the Moose. It's down just like I'd imagine it would be like that. They were all laughing so hard it was hard for her movie. <br /> <br /> As John Luckgud's late-lingerie was a wonderful addition to this. Capturing her, her one-piece material and Arthur's artwork were all equally hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him it's a little spoiled ____. I laugh every time I listen "I'll have a bath" with the lines that follow.
