All of us who are desperate to look at the blank and weakness of Disney Studios' latest production, here comes something that should heal your wounds ... Once a lifetime a bug brings the evidence to painting synthetic photos to make a Good scenes provide more interest than the "hand-made-old-disneys-love" cartoon designs (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magic background and atmosphere are gone for all time). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! . No weak part, a tremendous effort that shows its effectiveness in the backgrounds and the overall look of the sets, an amazing 3D bird (close to the perfection of its imitation of reality) ... and that only mentions the technical aspects. > <br /> The storyline, my friends, the real skull in a motion picture, some thickness! Curiosity, and obviously thanks to the Lasseter team, has virtually no music sequence in the bug's life. Which means that the story is long and rich enough to free himself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some children appreciate, but most others are flu (the same for parents or fans are animated, like me). This movie reminds me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Amigos; It was basically the same story background (a Mexican village living in fear of a few bad people (who finally turned to be actors) to protect them, etc. ...). Simple but effective, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of scary ants facing the anger of vicious insects. Since Microcosmos, many films tell bug stories, lives, fears and hopes, but I think a bug's life is sweeter and better to direct everyone. The process of the humanization was perfectly well achieved ... And all the audience was captivated by the Flik (aka Tilt in France) adventures. A great thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds. .. it's so strange and big at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughing while the bugs / actors forgot their lines or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for Those of you who saw the French version, other congratulations went to the dubbing actors who did a great sinchro job on this movie. The life of a bug is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to very few movies, and that's not a problem in the deposit room :). Go and see, it's an order.
