This is an interesting small flick of films made in 1967, with fresh music music jazz and a draw that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun cheese. I've seen many similarities between this and 'Creatures with the Blue Hand' (AKA die in Bloody) and have the same director! Eksel Scotland yard is investigating the murders of young ladies in a college. It seems that criminals have been released into a local prison to make the offer of some wrong people and then return when their work is done. There's a nervous device inside a bib that squirts acid squirts, and there's another device that is neither nourishing nor clandestine, it looks like a big shotgun and the victim is very close to dipping before they expire. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an Inspector and it mainly gums gum and looks off the distance. There's a "monk", and how anyone identifies this thing as a "monk" is beyond me, it carries a whip and dressed in a red outfit with a red hood, more of a clan member in a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of diligent devices like a fireplace host that is up and down to admit the brown, and it steps right on the fire without wearing her clothes, a nifty trick to the right. This is an odd combo of crime drama and harmonic jumps, and while it's rather funny at times it is fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
