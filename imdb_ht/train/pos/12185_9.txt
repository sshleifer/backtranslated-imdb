Woman from SHANGHAI is proof that large genius Orson Welles was able to direct a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. By comparison with his other, more artistic work, this film has only a moderate amount of ridicule, and almost no esoteric element. The exception being, of course, the final stage of the room of mirrors, largely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of films. It alone is worth the price of a rent. The sweet surprise was superb to act by Rita Hayworth's beautiful. It acts during the beginning and among the movie is so excellent, having made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
