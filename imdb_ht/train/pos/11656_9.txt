I saw a couple movies about eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one. The other problem was that people and diseases are eating towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help with it. This movie I thought was the most realistic cause of one main character of Lexi does not automatically get better. It gets better and then there is a disadvantage. I think this movie shows more than the others that I've seen that getting better not only happen, it's hard work and it takes time, it's a long way to cure. I think this movie shows all that well. There should be more movies like this.
