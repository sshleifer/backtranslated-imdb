The first time I saw blood of SAMURAI in its premiere during the Hawaii Film Festival Festival. WOW! Blood just blows us away with her absolute greenery, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, calm statement, and even more gore, and all of GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who enjoy all these Japanese samurai samurai and movie ninja, you define to see blood!
