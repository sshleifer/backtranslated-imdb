Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AK Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so this is not Anna Karenina, but it is a good love story, very well written and well-acting by all. Even some 'laugh-out-loud' moments blend in with some very serious observations about fidelity, age, and elderly / Alzheimer's problems. <br /> <br /> Quirky guitar music adds to the story as well. /> <br /> While I was a Ms. Annis fan 'since' Lillie '(in the' 70s) and the Mr. Kitchen since the 'Buccaneers' and' Anchanted April ', I've only recently discovered Mr. Green (' May and Mrs. Jones, Touching Evil, etc.), let me ask the question - why did not I see 'reckless' until recently ?? !! Admittedly more of a 'flicker chick' than something a person is sitting in, it is perfect to watch a lazy afternoon rush.
