Paris is where to enjoy beautiful art and music, and falling crazy in love - as is the case in this movie. The boy meets the girls, they fall in love, but something stands in the ways of eternal happiness, the classic story. The wonderful music of George Gerschwin completes the great dance by Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "An American in Paris" is a humorous, light-hearted, beloved movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
