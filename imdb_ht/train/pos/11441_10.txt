As an individual seeking an existence as a 'professional' person with income supported by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanitation has always been spasmodically sustained in indulgences outside of more artistic things. My post-post graduate courses have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal as well as welding, and art design that also includes screening. with jogging, walking and lately, remote destination excursions in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and excursions come one near the ground and time to stop and look and listen with pictures or sound effects. <br /> <br /> In what background, I was obsessed with RIVERS and TIDES. I was even impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the Harmony skills and the Director / Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the Goldsworthy art and camera path in Riedelsheimer. <br /> <br /> Wonderful thing. Wonderful thing. Wonderful thing.
