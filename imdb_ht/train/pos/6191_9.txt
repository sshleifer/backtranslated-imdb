It looks like Hal Hartley's film is kind of hit or miss with most audiences. This movie will be no exception to this rule. Faust Grim acts as an end to Hartley 'Henry Foole' from 1998. Focusing in this time is about Henry's ex-wife (played in perfection not always welcomed Parker Posey), who was seized by CIA goons on book Henry published on all its shadow behavior. In the interim of all these things, Fay ends up on an odyssey, dealing with international spyware, etc. The film finds a bit bogged down in the second half. If you were a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this one must not be missed. For the first timer Hartley review that has been heard only in film making techniques, you might want to check out her earliest movie before taking on this one (especially if you have not seen Henry again). I admire the camera work, which at times reminds me of some early Ray Ray photography.
