I do not remember this movie getting a movie release over here. I only saw it when it came to cable. The film deals with the deviousness of children in car killed. Especially a person, his way of replacing and casting (literally) into a community in the world where he finds himself able to cope with coming to terms with whom he really is and what he feels. for me that a lot of people expect this to be rambo in space, and would be happy if it was. <br /> I'm certainly happy to''t'nt - Kurt does a fine job in portraying an emotional disability. The scene where it sits outside the show show, albeit the decision for two slow-replays detracts from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic movie SF in the way that Bladerunner, aliens, running silently, Logan's Run or THX1138 was, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen in it in a long time . <br /> It changes to the film at a credible degree, it does not crack Arnie a Covered Materio, it does'nt become Plissken Snake and there is no definitive end to finish. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie did'nt do well. He did'nt follow the formula, and among a 18-25 year old American audience target, this endless as it was'nt what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> Always.
