I watched this movie when I was almost quite a kid and, of course, moved to tears in this story in a fox family. The fantastic scenery of Hokkaido, the excellent story and latest not least of the wonderful band gives an unusual intimacy with their protagonists. I'm always looking for some copy of the gorgeous band. German viewers might be useful to know that DEFA-Dubbing is the only one worth to listen to. I was stuck both (DEFA and BR), but I kept watching the first one.
