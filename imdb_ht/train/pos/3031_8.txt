He could have best been ruled by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job but it is not a great job of art cinemas. It is, however, a beautiful movie. I liked it since local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers in the last century. Some pretty bad movies have come from her novels and stories. (Many like the "idol falling", but I'm not in the midst of them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" once a year ago and loved it, but maybe I simply thought lovingly in the novel.) This is superbly cast. Charles Boyer does not, indeed, come across as Hispanic. But it seems to have the perfect temper for this character - tired, cautious, caring. Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl falls for her. But support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. His performance is a little grand Guignol, but I attribute to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first met as he gave Boyer a lesson in a universal language related to Esperanto, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. It comes across as a pre-boy boy early. The character wants to be useful. He did it better. <br /> I recommend this movie a lot. Not without reservations. The reservation is, firstly, that it is slightly stolid. But the story and act can only become better.
