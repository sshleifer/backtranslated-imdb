I sat down to look at this movie with great hopes and hopes. I did not think it would be possible for this movie to live up to its subjects. But it absolutely did, and then some. First, I must say that Jarred Harris has done extraordinary work as John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often puzzling, and it clearly studied the Lennon styling and dry wave. Aiden Quinn was as good as McCartney, he also brought a resounding hit Macca, although he had occasionally traveled on his scouse accent. This work of fiction has been well written and well-directed. It was most fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a peeking voyeur in a hole at this meeting. The three scenes were specially moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he never heard as a child - that he was worthy and important, and he never could be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents. I also enjoy the scene in the park where the pairs of dances and abandon the sheer band of reggae! <br /> <br /> One complaint I should be this: I'm not so sure that John was as appalling as she was described in the film at this stage of his life. It was established in his domestic situation quite nicely, and was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by the fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered. <br /> <br /> Mostly this movie served to stir up these feelings again on what might have been John lived a little longer. I quite assure that the bitles would come back together in some stages. And I'm sure Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> Well done, VH1. I'll watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
