'They're all laughing' is a superb Peter Bogdanovich who finally gets the recognition he deserves, and why? They are very much the fact that it's set in New York that really sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the star appeal turns out to Ben Gazzara, and the end of the Ritter Jan is superb. and of course no classics are completed without Audrey Hepburn. This film is a light comedy with romantic breezes that is very much in the vein of vicious comedies from the thirties, film is essentially about Odyssey detective agency run by Gazzara and his fellow detective smoker and unique artistic roller coaster Blaine Novak ( films co-producers) and John Ritter, basically Gazzara's fall to a great big tycoon's wife (Hepburn) and Ritter fell for beautiful Dorothy Stratten who sadly murdered after surgery, 'They're all laughing is essential for fans of Bogdanovich.
