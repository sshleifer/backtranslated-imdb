This is another favorite fantasy from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube that is. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorrowful quest between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Ice Age and his mother Juliana Juliana, has set their sights on the world's conquest known. When the glaciers destroyed the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) promised to rule his people and kill the Lord of Ice. Meanwhile, the sub-humans of Nekron and Juliana captured King King Jarol's daughter King Princess daughter Teegra; but he managed to escape, and eventually meet with Larn, which promises to scan it back to Firekeep; if the sub-people do not get them first. <br /> This movie made many box office (as did most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it became a cult classic, partly for the quality of art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and artist fantasy Frank Frazetta. Also, I heard that the scriptplay was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who made Conan comic books, and their background painter included James Gurney, illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; though admit I never read Conan or Dinotopia. And Thomas Kinkade's pendulum, noted for his artwork for figurines, music-boxes for the Bradford Exchange Company exclusive painting. Like the film Bakshi's Lord in the Rings and American Pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works best in this movie than in the former. So, in general, I think it's one of the best anime fantasy ever made, with an awesome collaboration between two great ideas - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With great fantasy, sexual orientation, and thrilling adventure.
