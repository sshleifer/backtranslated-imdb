I think the movie was kind of weird. At the opening stage, someone is dead for no reason. It is not mentioned again. Special effects could also be best but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It's not the best example of a classic horror movie but it's still a movie audience. I give it a 5 out of 10 of the scale.
