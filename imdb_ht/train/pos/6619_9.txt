Bright runners (Deckard is a Replicant!), City of lost children (increased sense or whatever is used and abused and especially, well, just give us far less than we might dream of), and <br> /> Black towns: <br /> <br /> These really should be added. <br /> <br /> For a while now, I was waiting for an animated movie that could affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This one is the 1st .. Hmm, scratch "anime" part of that. <br /> I have an intense love-hatred relationship with noir movie and, hey, if you do not leave, it must be especially like, right? But there are so many sci-fi and noir totters submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to look. <br /> <br /> These people have done an incredible job!
