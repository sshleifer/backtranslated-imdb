I just watch this movie again and remain scared of the cynicism that postpones it just as New Age. A big movie, one that takes its time to develop, it keeps coming close to going on the edge but never, and ultimately is mediated, affected, and colder in life than most movie people who cancel it "coincidences "can see. I was angry at the moment that movies like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I liked the letter) were nominated for this year's best photo (let alone that "the silence of the lambs" won!) And this was completely ignored except for a nomination for the best scenario. When it's reviewed, I think stories support my initial reaction!
