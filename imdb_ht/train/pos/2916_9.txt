Of all the films I've seen, and most of them, this is by far the best one that is mostly on the US Naval Airship (Blimps) during the WW-II era. There are other good LTA-related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time vaccine. Navy This man has considerably more real-time in blimps etc. True, many dynamic dialogues, but that's what makes movies more interesting to Hollywood, even today. P.S. I have spent 10 years (out of 20) and have more than 5,000 hours of Navy airships in all kinds, from 1949 to 1959.
