Unlike other comments, I found this filmy fascinating, even with all its fakes and the zombie act of some of the actors. <br /> <br /> Being a Technologist, I found that the experiences are interesting and the realistic hardware. Although reading from smart people across fantastic sound computers, their experience has now made just that. I will remember these experiences in a very early stage, and so far so far not favorable. The characters of the movie are well disposed. The girl, although overacting a bit, seems appropriate to mute. The truck driver is a ringer for real truck drivers. The Minister conveys the doubt at first, (the main investigator tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure if he believes that God created man or man who created God. But the minute when the ships went down, he falls on his trust .. Only the PhD plays the zombie.Secretes that their ports are suitable suitable for the characters .. In the face of death they react as real human beings would be. <br /> <br /> Movie is a warning against the danger of unlimited monitoring by the government. As a thriller, the film does not have enough emotion. As a scientific exercise and philosophical foundations it is fascinating.
