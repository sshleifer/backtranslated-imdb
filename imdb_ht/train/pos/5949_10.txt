Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, interesting, and credible story of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Very good colorful film. Another movie I love as well later on was High Society and Bing Crosby. Beautiful music. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
