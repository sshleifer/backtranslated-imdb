I have read most of the comments on this movie. I saw this movie (with the whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, all of us enjoying it and just pondering what we have already learned from reading and studying the Bible about their rapture. and at the end times. No one was scared or traumatized as I read about some posts. The film is just based on biblical reality. I've seen a lot of time movie cinema "Tribulation", "Armageddon" and so on and beyond this one is one of the best in presenting the Bible's truth. It may not have many great special effects like today's movies but I think it's a good witness tool. This film and its prophecies can be seen freely in this website at higherpraise.com, and judge for yourself. Blessings for all.
