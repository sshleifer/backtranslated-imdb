'What I love about you' is definitely a show that I could not wait to see everyday. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: 'The Amanda Show.' It's a very funny person and looks to be down to earth. "Holly" is like someone who can-and has an "out-there" personality. I loved how he always seems to turn things around and upside down, so he messed himself at times. But that's the show that's so great. <br /> I especially liked the show when Vince's characters came together. Nick Zano is very HOT and Funny, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn, and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially like 'Lauren'; it's best! He helped make the extra funny show and you never know what he's going to do or say next! The overall show is really nice but the reason I did not give it a 10 was because there's no more new episodes and because the episodes might have been longer and more deep.
