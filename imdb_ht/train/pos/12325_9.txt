I saw this first movie when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on the UK 2000AD. My people Steve Parkhouse has registered on VHS and sent it to me. Until then, I would really only see Shaw Bros Kung Fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so audiences could see their movements clearly), so it was a revelation to see something similar to It was lit by Ridley Scott coming from Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently, "Choy Huk"). But for all the smokers, back-lit exterior and ambitious special effects (Stop-Motion? In a Hong Kong movie?) In the heart of Chinese STORY story lies a simple and moving love story, made all the more real It's not the talented actress of Leslie Cheung (what's a tragic, tragic garbage in a lifetime!) With the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Joey's award is gorgeous, but it's her ballet gesture that gives her character an unattainable erotic hard to analyze. But even though Joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd, which of us is not?) This will always be the durable image of this actress. Some reviews here are said that the film is simplistic and lacking any surprises but will miss the fact that this film was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700 ! That's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and just copying West Side story. (Just wanted to get that in my chest!) For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the story of excellent romantic stories. It has great tragedy, because we know Chio Sin and sin can never be together. It's about becoming mature, so none of us can mature until we experienced great loss. It is about sacrifice, for sacrifice is an essential element of true love. And the comedy studios of Wu Ma do not hurt a bit, either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Chinese gorgeous story by trying to see it in a filter of Western culture and you'll get over and it's just fine.
