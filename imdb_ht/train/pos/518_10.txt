Also known as the "Heavenly Staircase" in the US. During the WWII British Peter Carter (David Niven) plane was shot in combat but continued to live. She meets and falls in love with beautiful junk (Kim Hunter). But it looks like a mistake made in the sky - it should have died! A French spirit comes to him but refuses. She is soon pleading her case in front of a Heavenly Court that she should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> Sound ridiculous but this is actually an incredible movie. The good script and the actors are playing their roles completely straight-faced with it very well-directed - the scenes of the Earth's breath-taking technicolor (I have never seen as beautiful blue sky) and the scene in the sky black and white! Niven is a little stubborn at times but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help Niven. The entire image is amazing (especially the stairwell and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are really great (considering the movie's age). There is also a very unusual sequence when Niven runs in a totally naked sheep flock of sheep! This is a really nice, thought film movie - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the US is a shame.
