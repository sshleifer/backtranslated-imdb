"Such a Long Journey" is a well-crafted film, a good shot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a mix of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of jack of all cemetery and master of any. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoteric of lazy culture rather dark a little to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for people with an interest in India.
