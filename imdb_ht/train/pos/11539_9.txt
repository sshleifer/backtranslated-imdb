The ODD Coupe is the classic movie version of Neil Simon's famous play on a television TV TV called Felix Unger, who is a neat freak obsessive, who moves in with his best divorced friend, Oscar Madison, a sporwriter and Complete slave, after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar took his best friend and regretted her from the moment he did it. Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway and Carney Art playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the movie version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role, but so really real that it brings a component of sadness to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate her role as Oscar, a gem-a-a-kind of comic performance that gives consistent laugh at all. This equipment from Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be funny gold that was re-visited by nine other films. And both of these actors have not yet with us, look at this classic become more touchy, but no less hilarious. Playing Simon is nicely expanded to the screen and a silent prologue is chronically a devious Felix suicide in an attempt to be a winner. Thrust in support includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner as Oscar poker plays Amy and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Sisters Piedgon, Blind Date at Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent television series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing like the original. A joy from beginning to end.
