Jammin 'Blues is a short Oscar-nomination from 1944 which is basically 10 minutes of impromptu jazz played in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "Sunny Side of the Street" to a point to emphasize the movie then jitterbugs and Archie Savage brings this most fun "jam session" to its exciting end. Director of Gojn Mili was a photographer and that show experiments at some of the dots exhibited duplicates of some of the musicians who make this one of the most innovative angles of the '40s. According to some scores I read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouettes of reflection in their social attitude of the time. What a shame. Still, the most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube so if you like jazz, I suggest you looking for it.
