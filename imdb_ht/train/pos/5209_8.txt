I saw this important movie tonight tonight. Richard Gere and Claire's Dane are the most important and best work. Gurus deserves an Oscar for painting his fine to a man who was forced into early retirement as a sexual offender administrator. Claire Danes is Riveting as Woman Getting Handpicks to Replace It - a woman she tries to teach everything she can while investigating a final case in which Gere's character convinced the one whom she was charged controls may be to keep an old girls. The subject is shocking, sexual offenders and controllers, but this movie will not soon be forgotten. I know I'm going to be haunted by Gere's paintings for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins painted in a serial killer has a scary screen portrait and thus engages me. The movie opens with a shocking static for not missing the opening credits. Great and memorable. Richard Gere's first role is to prove the man can act. The Danish can also be well with both extraordinary assets in this film often difficult. <br /> <br /> This is a Eraser film and Gere has given a multi-layer performance deeply felt. Just give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
