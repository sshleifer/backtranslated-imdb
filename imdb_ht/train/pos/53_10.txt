Home room really surprised me. In comparison with other movies written about Columbine High School this is the best. Home Rooms do not show school shooting but rather the consequences and effects of the community and the city. Focusing on films' over two opposing characters., Alecia (Occupy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the whole shooting. It seems they do not show any emotions about it. Deanna is a popular girl with the victim's surviving single. Alecia is forced to attend Deanna at the hospital in order to graduate. Meanwhile the police are investigating Alecia as it might have known that the shooting was going to happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get together first. Eventually they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (much of the style of the breakfast club). Bell House home shows the power of shutdown and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
