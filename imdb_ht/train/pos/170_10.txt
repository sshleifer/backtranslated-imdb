Do not listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! Young rich Joan and his brother find themselves penniless after their father die - and now they have to work for a living! He, of course, becomes a reporter, and he, as usual, a driver for the mob! Not the wild co-incident careers are self-esteemed, thanks to Clark Gable gangsters. In the meantime there is the chance of a swimmer moon swimming for a bunch of beautiful young things and for Joan making a couple of dense counting numbers (and all the grace of a steam-pod). But none of this is supposed to take seriously - it's all good fun of these beautiful days pre-rope, when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great, and shows a lot of emotional series that would give her career as longevity (thanks to her having stopped the dance!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - it was not a star anymore and so did not have to be the hero. Great to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as the poor brother confused. And there are some great mountings and follow courtesy courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece over with a sailing pace - and an occasional Wink the audience! Great fun!
