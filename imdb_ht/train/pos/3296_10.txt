Mina Kumari displays more style and grace just moves from standing, sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director of the product was more memorable in beauty touch than it would seem possible. The music and dancing are of the highest possible quality. You can be noticed in the dance scene the first director has all sorts of things done in the background: other girls dance, drinking down stairs, lots of activities, but she knew that we should watch Mina dance and I'll bet unless you see this much time, you did not notice.All of all, perfection. jQ
