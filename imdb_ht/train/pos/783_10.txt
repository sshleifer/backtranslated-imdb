The first word that comes to my mind after watching this film is "beauty". Beauty is all around, in play actor '(Andie is superb as always), in well-designed vaccines, and in the author' idea line wheel - the like. <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in the life of 3 years' life boring and predictable. His interaction makes Andie's character living as fun as it could be possible. When it was gone, it became obvious that we can not really appreciate and keep in our interior believers with sacred desires. The fact that Andie successfully recovers from this loss has nothing bad, rather than it shows that priority life in any form, even in this small British village, shows perfectly. <br /> Another reason I like this movie is that it is so British in every way - all that house with "sentence" and accent :))). And Andie again doing superb jobs! It's a shame that this film got these low marks. 10 out of ten!
