"One shot, one killed, is no exception." A must see if you are in marine or sniper. two thumbs up! Great overall scenario, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a movie hang and pick out the corrections. This is to sit back and have a good 99 mins. The plot has some depth but this film is not really about making you think. It's about to enjoy the sniper form and action. Sniper professionals 2 and 3 are very good follow-ups but the first is still the best movie overall. Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and shows the hidden side of the sniper life. the plain to deal with all of the death. You must see for sniper fans.
