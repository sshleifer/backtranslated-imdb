Fast paced and funny satire on the original "TV reality", the soap opera. The script by Robert Harling's dramatic play is loaded with one material and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates in bad improvement and brain transplantation. Keen's keel killed in his line, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. "His brain will later explore the next few houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a treat to see a click cast as he does in this movie. This is a classic that somehow slipped into the cracks. Score by Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with the flamboyant and melodramatic air.
