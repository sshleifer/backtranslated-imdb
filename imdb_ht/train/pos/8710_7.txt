I remember this TV show in Swedish. I was only 7 years old and she scared me beyond belief. <br /> I would like to review this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember if I suspect my taste and demands have changed. br /> <br /> Although this was released before aliens and a plethora of other space-thrill I suspect it has its roots in scary films from the 50: s and the political climate of 70: s. When I think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The sign has since been weak and becomes the theme for any movie that has spacecraft in them.
