I bought this one year or more ago for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), leaving it on the rack for age, now watching DVDs while stopping with a cold .. This is a haunted movie . Brilliant performance not all involved, especially the 6yo boy (on the only smiles you get from this movie). Complete reminds me of maybe my favorite movie ever, Grosse Pointe Blank, but obviously this lighthearted, this is heavy intrusive. <br /> As a psychologist, a clinical and legal psychologist, a tremor up my spine when the new identity revealed the deal. Scary stuff! Brilliant work all round. <br /> <br /> Burst
