... would probably be the best word for describing this movie (in my opinion). besides a great heck of a fan of girls fans (well, that was redundant ~), it was the story that blew me away. hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people will agree with me about this one, but it was not one of the three great actors (the guys who played Sho, son and Kei) who gave the best performance ( for me, anyway). It was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from the Battle of Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not hurt me, I love Hyde, I worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes had become a 'little bit' little, but I loved that scene where he dances and the guy's body dies to kill the other guys. and Gackt was not at all wrong, I prefer how his character was kind of aloof from the start. There is nothing so much I can tell about my background on le-Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he has brought his own weight and cast into star-nailed. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji by Taiyou (forgetting my spelling if it's wrong). While the full song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice the length because you should enjoy Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for the fans (big fans ~ ~) but for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic, Asian-style movies.
