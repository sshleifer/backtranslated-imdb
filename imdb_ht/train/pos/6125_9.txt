Well, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought of myself, this looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. My boy was right, it's interesting. They put the crazy murderer into dreams, in carcasses and inside car daily. But this happened to be the most unique place to put the spirit into a series killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I love all the friendly snowman almond littering landscape, the skin holder, the snow globe, etc. I love the actor who played Jack and put some fun in a really crazy murder since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I told her. FREDDY WRITER. It's that level of "cool". I wish some of the puppet effects were the best, the mouth movements could match better. Here I am chalking up to a small budget. Throw to do a good job, some great one criticisms and crises make any fan of hardcore fans. All and all, a great story, good effect, great dialogue and a great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
