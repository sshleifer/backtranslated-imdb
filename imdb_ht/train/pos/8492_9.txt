Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and it's absolutely hilarious in this movie. Matching his steps for stage is Gedde Watanabe. Two of them work nice together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like showing Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Watanabe) fighting in their role as leaders in their respective groups. They both try hard to keep the peace, and then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, they're both on the floor. Then hunting jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps off the office. Hunting jumps over the desk with him. The fight then flows out of the office at the factory. I love that after being separated by the workers, you can say that they both feel bad about leaving things out of hand. Also, there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt had on Kazihiro. She is at her home & her boss from Japan arriving & said she would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: Factory is closed & we can not find key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not picture Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> I guess I really love this movie because it's really funny, and also shows how people are radically different can not only learn from each other, but become good friends too.
