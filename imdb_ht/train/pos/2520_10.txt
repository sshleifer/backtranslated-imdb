Despite what others said (* tough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I was waiting to see it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's strange, but that just gives it more of an interesting taste. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first Gackt and Hyde movies. They have not done so much at all, perhaps 3 or 4 heads each. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best in the first night. I believe that they throw some odd situations in there, but I'm looking at that to get the best points in this movie, the emotions appear and summer. That's why, I gave, and always give, this movie a 10 out of 10.
