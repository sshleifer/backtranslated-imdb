When a small town is threatened by a child assassin, a police officer goes behind him not to pretend to be his friend. As it becomes more emotionally involved with the psyche murderer he begins to take a beating that causes him to lose focus on the task of catching the criminal. Not a movie of high voltage stimulation, but solid work tasks and a good illustration of the head fault in a psychotic deficit.
