An interesting thriller with Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder. Paul Winfield was a disgusting actor who pulled all his roles with these facilities, and it was hard to tell the same man to act. Maybe they are recognized by voice viewers as "City Confidential", Winfield ends his career with such a movie; but as always, Winfield shines. A treat to look. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is well, Erika Eliniak, nice look at leaving a lot to be wanting in the acting department. Though, to be fair, this is one of its best efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a watchable thriller that should not be missed by any fan of Paul Winfield. A decent telephone call to help Paul Winfield into celuloid sky. What an actor. It will be missed.
