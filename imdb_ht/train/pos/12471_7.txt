I did not know the real events when I sat for that look, just the fact that this was based on a true story. Following the kid's kidney death, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know that someone actually called her children) to cope with the loss. This is really done for kids, as is often the case with "family" flicks (and that is said, go ahead and get everyone together for a look, though I would keep teen out of it, unless you're sure they're going to buy the concept), but it does not downplay the sting that the death of a parent is, and it does not really go down to anyone. The draw is sufficiently interesting, and moves along well enough. Acting varies, and excellent Burstin's most exaggerated to his fellow cast, Mathis after that very well, and Ferland and his comrades (with a few exceptions) were the least compelling of the bunch (and frankly, they are disappointing; That's again, I'm not really in the audience intended for this thing). The correction and the standard cinematography, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of fun lines or tones, the tone is not one unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two of this. I recommend this to fans of these kinds of movies. 7/10
