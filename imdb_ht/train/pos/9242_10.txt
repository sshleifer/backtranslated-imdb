Is it difficult to movie movie like this, because you miss it on production or just fun? <br /> I saw this movie back in on 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say he started a long lifetime passion with ninja. The plot is fairly foolish and the act is of course horrible, but there is a certain mystic surrounding the ninjas in this movie that makes for quite a good atmosphere. What is important is the battle scene, while a 'little' sparce is really good. <br /> I must say it was best when I was a boy, only now I can see the blatant points of the unbelievable nonsense of the movie, but as a "sitting back with a few beers" martial arts movie I can not blame it, it is saved and is better than the Mountains of Garbage Style "Indian Ninjas" that has been churned out of the 80's and hundreds of guys in black suit, but really not very good battle scenes. <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killer made another movie under the banner of Bonaire movie called "White Phantom" I have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel in Sakura Killer "but the Sakura family is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story just this time including a white ninja. This too, while being especially stressful , there was a small sense of atmosphere, but scenes of fighting even more scarcely and to be frank, are very awful. <br /> So, if you are a martial arts fan then give it an explosion kill a few hours!
