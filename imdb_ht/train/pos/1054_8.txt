If you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic look at Seattle, then this is the show for you! The concert of black angels is nothing new (in fact, there's conflict on whether James Cameron stole the idea of ​​a book), but I spend all hours watching it every Tuesday from beginning to end. Jessica Alba is smoked with Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just as hot. The battle scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between the original Cindy and Max need a little better (the jargon sounds forced and sounds like someone living in the suburbs they wrote). /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great fun full of fun and everything a fan of action may require, but if you are looking for striking hard, award-winning drama, go see "West Wing" or a thing.
