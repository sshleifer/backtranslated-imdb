I said I totally loved the movie. It has it in funny moments, some heart parts, just all around good. Me, personally, really liked the movie because it's something that ultimately I can relate to my childhood. This movie, in my opinion, fits more towards the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy should be treated while growing up. All the testimonies, non-call, and do not know is something I, like most other young feminine men, will always remember, and now finally a movie that shows how difficult it really is to grow gay. So I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. Probably would not really look it until someone old and mature enough to understand it
