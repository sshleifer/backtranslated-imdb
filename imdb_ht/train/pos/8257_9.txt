Just saw the First World of Fido at the Toronto Film Festival and well enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome rework of a genre widely thought to have pioneered (certainly 'lurks out' a lot and success) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian movie by a Canadian director and he's a comedy! And, YES, I actually think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Well-known and perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we will see a lot more in the future. However, I must confess that I enjoyed the most delicious by Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Theopolis, essentially playing an animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpus Bride (or, for those who saw the movie, t which is even better here as the corpse pride?), And, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly at his youngest anime, yet somehow somehow moving the role as the titular character. Simply thinking, he would not have gotten this role he was not for Peter Stormare's commitment to imprisonment (as revealed by Q & A last night screening). I can not help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from zombie into 'Bub'. Zombie The Dead. I'm not keen on ever revealing details drawn during a comment and I will not start right now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those people, graphics graphically gory zombies you can count on from Romero. Instead it is a movie that will have you constantly chuckling, and, although (and I've had to think back carefully to be sure) there is a just dose of blood-letting and violence, the depletionable humor, well Improved by the surreal success created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this look like a feature that should be rated PG-13. I urge you to see this small Canuck gem. I will certainly be able to buy the DVD once it looks like the next summer.
