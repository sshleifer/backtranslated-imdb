A fine martino outing, this is a frustrating and enjoyable joke with fine performances from good looking casting and primarily driving from George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> For me the gig-sees puzzle in a plot is so entangled and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than trying to anticipate. Just when all seems to resolve us again to take on a set of more twists, enjoyable torsion, he must say. <br /> Sexy and very in fighting kill this movie a well-paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal places. A super final set on Aegean rock ends things and lots of fun there was not all.
