Wow this was a movie was completely fascinating I could not believe I started waking so late to watch it, but it came on late ounce I started watching I could not stop it having a full set of good cast cast wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many well-known actors and this actress was more than a glimpse into history of eye opening in another part of society that people who do not know of and can even have embarrassed to talk about. I have never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses just looks on because they are privleged and mixed race, I highly recommend this movie
