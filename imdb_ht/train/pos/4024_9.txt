I was very fond of this movie. He kept me guessing just before the end of so much that would happen. One of the best movies on the partition that I saw. Urmila Matondkar is also gorgeous. This is one of the most personal and down-to-the-movie films I've seen on the partition. It is a little less mainstream than Gadar, and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what goes on, and comes out completely the other one. This is not typical Bollywood tickets, but rather a kind of art-house movie. The best part of this film is that it does not discriminate one side of the conflict partition when focusing on the story of another. It does not blame or castigate but rather allows you to draw your own conclusions on things.
