Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple people among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> Generally I hate mystery trumpet (like this), but I love this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), very well directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of kamikaze tricks that just narrows the narrative rate together), has a very inventive line (including a solution to a room killer closed that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very hero and great like Vance - it does not seem to be acting - it's Vance! Mary Astor does not give much to do, but adds grade and beauty to the production. Everyone else is very good too, but the best of all is Eugene Palette as Detective Heath. She is a very good actor and a very different voice and some of her lines were hilarious. Basically, an excellent 30's Hollywood murder mystery. Well worth seeing. <br /> <br />
