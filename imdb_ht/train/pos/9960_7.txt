I noticed that this film came trashed well before it hit theaters and I did not have high hopes for it. I figured it was another "You've come to serve" the kind of movie with some nice dance moves and bad acting. I was in the theater and decided between this and meet the Spartans and choose this. My surprise the act was not bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than you got used is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a show that shows in this movie so you do not spend too much. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and how bad everyone was on it. When it comes to this dance cinema is certainly one of the best and far superior to act than many of the other ones. Go to the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVDs and more people check the movie out instead of being judged based on previous movie comments released. The movie edition is currently moving closer to its correct rating. More than 1000 people gave it a rating 9, somewhat too high, but at least it will help offset the ridiculous votes at 1.
