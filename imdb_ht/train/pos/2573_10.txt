When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there is a movie insisting on watching over and over again: You guessed it, K-911, the third installment of the Successful K franchise -9 begins everyone in Dad's favorite TV, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Folks, I knew it was possible to put out a VHS tap, but a DVD? This has often played that it's starting to jump; no jokes! But of course you will have that when you own a movie so good, so brilliant. Of course, we have to thank the only and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the beloved dog-dog and Turner and Hooch; However, even this film does not measure up to absolute excerpts that are featured in all three K-9 movies. Some people say that Belushi was running out of steam and this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you might suspect that a third-direct-to-video installment, in which - may not seem like something worth looking, you would prove yourself wrong after watching this movie quality. <br /> I will not give away the scheme, but I'll say that Belushi and his slope partner give the best performance yet - one that will have you HOW and laugh! It's a shame to John Belushi who is not alive to see what's going on in the world's big brother-in-law. <br /> I highly recommend your young daughter to introduce this BFFs movie to her next sleeping party. Do not forget to chow the puppy!
