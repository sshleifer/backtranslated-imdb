"Spin it!" <br /> The 90s are open up with a favorite Disney favorite, "TaleSpin," the TV cartoon series featured characters from the "Jungle Book." Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly the sea ducks as you've never seen before: from Cape Suzette, Louie, Mountains, Forests, Water, Volcanoes, Looking for adventure, looking for treasures, looking seek pleasure, all in one action-packed adventure !!!!! <br /> This was my favorite as well as my family. This run on the Disney Afternoon Afternoon halfway through the 90s until the original designs moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before you got cable in March of 1997. <Br /> And good news: today the DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "dun, beautiful, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> 10/10
