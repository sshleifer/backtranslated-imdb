Perhaps the greatest movie ever on jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot will continue to haunt him reverie. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of the world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a pleasure (see also the sound of jazz too). <br /> <br /> If you can, get the music; it's available on CD. <br /> <br /> What lovers of jazz and movie noir should study this tremendous jewelry ... What shadow and light - that music - what a hat!
