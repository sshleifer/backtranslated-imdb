The National Lampoon Reunion Group is a classic comedy movie from the early 80's that combines unique characters, lots of laughs, and some great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his peers at high school graduation he takes the opportunity to get his revenge on his class reunion. One does not read his peers footage including an innocent virgin blind, a horny guy has a lot, high school beauty, the king all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slipping into all the kids during high school. This movie has a sort of awesome element in it and has a few short scenes of sexuality so I would not recommend it to teenagers but it's a great movie for adolescents. If you are looking for a movie with a nice note, complex character or killer special effects you would not like Reunion classes. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some big laughs and a lot of fun (and not) then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. + +
