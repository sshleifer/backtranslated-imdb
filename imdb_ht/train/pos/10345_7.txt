Only other reviews of this movie as of this date really trash the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read the comments users to give me an idea of ​​what to expect in a movie I do not know much about. It's unfortunate when there are so many reviews for a certain tile, because when there is one review and it's unrealistic to waste the movie and cast, you do not get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before you look at this title and I do not know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came out. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attracted to those who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the movie with fun and enjoyable performance. It's not one of the classic ever, but a bandwidth and comedy-much more than you can expect to be in the worst movies. If you're a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
