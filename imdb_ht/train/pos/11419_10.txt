Claire Denis' first is one brave and self-assured. In this decision of life towards the end of Colonial French Cameroon, he explores the relationship between men and women, black and white. <br /> With the black 'Protected' black as the main film of desire and asthma, the film enters taboo territory in the beginning. Denis built a photo of life in a series of character relationships that keep the viewer informed the fixed screen. The mood of the movie is captured perfectly by the camera-work and (lack of) lighting. <br /> A great talk.
