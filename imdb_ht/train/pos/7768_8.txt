This glorious turgid melody represents Douglas Circk in his highest nourish. He eschews the soft wonders of "All that is in heaven enabled" with the Sentimentalite sick of "imitation of life" and instead went for angry harassment and overheating was warmed. And of course, it's all captured by vibrant Technicolor. <br /> The cornball story has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack who becomes a rivalry when Hudson snag their affections at Lauren Bacall, but who really pays attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won a Best Action Academy for Best Academy for her wonderful performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business in her own hands when there is no one else. A highlight of the film comes when this high-dynamic wild child breaks into a frantic dance in his room, able to bring the restrictions placed on it by means of proprietary classes. As so often occurs in circus movies, the scene is both hilarious impulses in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness. Circus has come closer than anyone else to turn to the highest quality art camp, meeting the philistines and high at the same time in the same films. It was a unique talent and I do not know that there has ever been another movie maker quite like him since. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
