I've seen this film many times and I love all bad teachers wanting to give ten people but feel that it would be unfair to other good movie. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It is I would venture one of the biggest comic films of all time. Matthew and Lemmon are perfectly matched matching. The script is so sharp that you need to focus the bleeding. The story is well-known and has been described in other comments. Driving two extraordinary performances, girls are superb and their situation is side-divisive humorous. There is no single oath-word (mark Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the move from the movie stage is noisy. They do not like this again. Timeless.
