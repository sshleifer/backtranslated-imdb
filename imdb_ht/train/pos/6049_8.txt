Freebird is the perfect wedding of comedy road trips, gang captors, "stoner" movie and feel-good British movie. <br /> It is the brilliant lead characters that put this movie apart from other films in this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, stretches Gary and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and make their characters largely remarkable and realistic. The main trail center of the road trips from London to Wales, and the adventures and badies that occur along the way. This little movie also has a big heart - it's not just for bike fans, as it's base around the character's relationship with each other including dreams and regrets, such as Fred Gary Stretch's longing for the family he has left behind . The cinematography is also great - a love letter in the Welsh country as well as capturing the London city's grittiness and typical PUB life in the Welsh cities. funny storyline - I'd recommend Freebird to a heartbeat!
