Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio deal and goes to Hollywood. It stays in Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time great egotist star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new photo. In a studio panic usually watch Virginia (Rosemary Lane) imitate her and have Bowers take it to the premiere NOT tell her is not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself. <br /> <br /> The draw is old (put it nicely), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very likable pair and have nice voice singing. The Good Score (marked by "Hooray for Hollywood") and Director of Busby Berkeley show off his unique visuals in a truly fun driving-in the music sequel (with Edgar Kennedy's sponsors burning slowly). Also, Glenda Farrell has a few funny bits as Jones Jones Sisters. <br /> <br /> Always the movie is not that good. The rest of the mug thrown vagrants and most of the humor is just not funny. Lola Lane is especially ridiculous trying to play Mona for comedy. Also there is racism - a stereotype black girl plays for laughs and some really awful "humorous" racism at one point. This is probably what keeps this on television most of the time. I realized it was accepted at the moment, but it came to all riot today. <br /> All in all a movie so-so with some serious problems helped by a good throw and some great songs. I give it a 7.
