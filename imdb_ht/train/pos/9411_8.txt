Sidney Stratton has trouble keeping work in a variety of fabric mills mainly because of his experience in the fabrics labs. The Stratton experiences a formula for a new cloth that would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or expands. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric, it creates enemies of all the fabric workers (which will lose their job) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill right are exclusive), so Stratton in his white suit, becoming the most wounded man in England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could do it. Power Guiness' (with a great cast of support like Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction to make a movie a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, a beautiful satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance , and suspense. Rating, 8.
