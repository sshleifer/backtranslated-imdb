What with all the European (especially England) comments here? All I have to say is that when I saw this movie for the first time when I was like 13 I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's the point. You will see Dr. Strangelove's and Men in Black to find all the jokes behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and were expensive Hollwood films and real actors in them. For what it is worth, the White Man is a very stupid-humorous mocker in a movie. With all the stupid-humorous things England has made for the last half century, I'm shocked by all the negative comments. Our stupid Americans like our stupid humor. PS, see 'America Team: Global Police' for some true laughs that Europeans are especially fond of. HA!
