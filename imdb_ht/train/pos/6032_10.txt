Antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when she got this movie done. She went to America working under a much-smarter contract from the studio (MGM) and made the most modern portrait of American society I ever saw. Having seen first LAI but this is the most accurate painting in the crowded city, overheating and human. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... </ em> </ em> </ em> </ em> It's sad that people do not get to see this movie again as I believe Antonioni proved right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civilian movement right in the politics of America. Everyone is more interested in what goes through the pockets and the relentless expansion of living space in the deserted (yet beautiful) and beyond. How would I like to see the interest in this movie re-lit and a lavish DVD release. <br /> I ask people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a really unique movie to comment on a turning point in the most powerful story of the nation on the planet, and we have forgotten about it. <br /> An unusual gem.
