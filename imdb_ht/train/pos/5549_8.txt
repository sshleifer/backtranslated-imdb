The film silently pride in the clan begins Mary Pickford was supposed to be placed in a fictional island on the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the exterior shots were filmed at Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several geographical zones areas including Churn and Castle Rock. My first interest in the movie was because of two factors: 1) where Marblehead movie in my town, and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a stand-up for Mary Pickford during several films scenes including the "cliff scene". Both women were small (5 ') high and both my father and grandma related the fact that he was a stand-up and came back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton Chie series . I just wanted to tell this story for future film historians and enthusiasts. The movie itself (my DVD copy is a bit poor) very well done with lots of action and expressive acting as several scenes where Miss Pickford shows a strong character of women. I loved it and I would like to get a better copy of it though I'm not sure if one exists as I've seen in various movie sites that remain the dark copies because of deterioration. A very beautiful movie of the genre is silent and lots of action!
