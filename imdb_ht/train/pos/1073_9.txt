It took us a couple of episodes to "get off" black angel as a story and a series, since we were transitioning from the Sopranos, a fundamentally different mentality. But once we got to the animal in the series, we were very quickly hooked. It's a shame that the series ended up just when it was just beginning good past the excellent category: Dark Angelwas more than your average TV series. It enjoys asses and stones as far as action goes, but the interactions of the characters and reaction of society to "mutants" remind us of the constant preconceions that we face (and do) everyday. That the story put in the future holds the surreal mood and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed into our faces (hence the damaging "fun" for those who do not like to be reading during entertainment), but every event and The human / society interaction remains important for present. We all make judgments, facing our own prejudices, but, in the end, the question of who you are lying in: you sit back and close your mind to it, or you get up and do something about it read it? For those who have no choice but to fight, survive or justice, this series reinforces them. For those who have never faced the question, this series "sneaks" that message under the guise of pure action entertainment. It is more well done and well written than most TV series; I highly disappointed he had finished before he could really kick off the high gear.
