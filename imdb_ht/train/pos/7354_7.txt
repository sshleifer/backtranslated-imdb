I saw this first movie over 25 years ago on British television and was just just caught up with it again last week on a DVD copy purchased in eBay. I remember the music sequences, the color and the gorgeous fashion plate pose and clothes, but the plot is weaker than the earlier Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding movie in Spring Park in Lane Park and Maytime does not stand well for the passage of years. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, funny, creepy, appearing to have great fun and on top of his form. Worth looking for her alone. Anna Neagle appeared a little matronly around her, and a little too old for the party she played but at the end of the 1940's film partnerships were well established and the movie went public. The Spring Park Spring was a top hit for 1947 and a huge money maker. In Wobbiography, Wilding writes in his great consideration for Herbert Wilcox director and incubator in this London series of films.
