When I saw the DVD box devised for this and the insuportable Queen Queen Queen, I felt certain I was in for a great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Nonsense and impartial nonsense conflicts that such an intense denial should run to the point of barely being read to the subtitles, let alone take in the ridiculous explanation. These quibbles apart, however, the movie is a dream. Fabulous lady of fabulous outfits in wonderful surroundings and everything is constantly on the move and accompanied by a nice note to Bruno Nicolai notes. It may not be Morricone but in the lighter pieces it might be as well so. Really enjoyable with lots of colors, lots of sexiness, some kill catches and minimal police intentions. Super.
