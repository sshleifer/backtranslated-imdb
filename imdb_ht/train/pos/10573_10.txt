An excellent example of the Berkeley Spectacular Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. Audiences should be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of car. Quite a contrast from his "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney makes adding sparks and interests to a rather tired routine out formulated storyline & draw. But the film's highlight is 3 elaborate outputs back to back. The first and Honeymoon Hotel Conservative number, then followed by the highly spectacular sighting "sequel", followed by the section "Shanghai Lil" section, Cagney only participated in the last number trapped he got upside down a counter bar with Ruby Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number and Cagney are excellent, but a bit of a comedy & anti cumbersome after the more exciting and incredibly boggling minds "By A Waterfall" choreography. If I was the director I'd put "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and close with "not a cascade", which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water to speak & in my view the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the mirror on the cake & James Cagney's performance is added cake decoration. An exceptional outstanding music, a 4 star movie, the final music, well worth seeing, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
