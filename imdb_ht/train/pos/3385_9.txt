Soylent Green I found an excellent film. <br /> If you like the Logan Run you will love this. Yes the old film and no special effects and some of the act can be a bit better described as "cheese", but the story is excellent. <br /> The story of how the world can and its impact on society is very intense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded in an easy one of the right march. <br /> It's the nearest modern day equivalent would be "black angel" in terms of how the US is showing to be third-world countries.
