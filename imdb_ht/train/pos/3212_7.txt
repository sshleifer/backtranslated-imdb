I watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it was not as successful (commercially or artfully) as it should be, and discover considerable artistic merit - which can finally be hampered by its commercial. /> <br /> First of all, this movie tries "serious" science-fiction, Next social, more than action-adventure. There are actions in it, but that's not really what it's about. If you focus on that, you will end up with (as noted otherwise) a bad "Foreign" script. But again, that's not what it's about. The film is really about Todd's transformation (Kurt Russell) from the near-human human and back to people (especially * back *). But because he is not trying to give you a typical Hollywood style globe, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and hugely broad-minded. And it really does a great job - it can take two look for it to appreciate it. "The social logic that surrounds" is flawed and never explains whether Todd's ability to keep his own against a host Supposedly superior troop from his experience on the battlefield or newfound human or that, but the movie still does a The showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.
