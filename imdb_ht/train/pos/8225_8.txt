Strange enough, all the comments before simply describing the start and leaving the details on. I feel a need to confirm that it is a family work, since Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife, with excellent music - jazz written by Andr√©'s father. Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when released and immediately identified with the music. The suspension was damaged, and was maintained throughout until the end. Robert Hossein, at the time of one of the best European players, managed to impose himself as a top screen and stage director. He has always set up great stage shows, with a preference for religious subjects. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
