Cinderella is a beautiful movie, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it's one of the best films in the 1950s. <br /> I think all the characters are depictingly amazing. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's stepisters and her stepmother, sweet to Cinderella. Mouse is funny and sweet too. <br /> I think they change the story a bit, but I think it's for the best. It's like a beautiful movie, and I do not think anyone can resist it deep down. <br /> I give it an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it sure is a true classic.
