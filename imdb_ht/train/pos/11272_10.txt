108: Tarzan and his Mate (1934) - released 4/20/1934, to see 8/6/08. John Dillinger escaped from prison and robbed a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde killed two highway patrol in Texas. PERSON: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After we were instead disappointed with the original 'Tarzan Man Ape,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'Tarzan and his Mate,' were the best of the series. That's true. I got a big kick from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the grape-swinging wildlife, wildlife super-hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan darn his role as Jane entirely fantastic love (which sports an outfit for the first and last time here). In my review for 'Ape Man,' I stomped on Jane very well for her mania and clothes and incessantly she screamed, but she rescued herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character of the whole cast. He acts as the ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, he can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and he knows how to keep in an angry pride of lions when he is out of bullets. He even got the forest itself right now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. He totally received his training. Cheetah is quite good as well, taking off the mark of Martin's cigarette. The plot is primarily an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the most vicious jungle animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhino. Their effects, though still visible, are more dynamic and fresh and complement the action nicely. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimmer scene. All I can say is yes, it is naked. Very interesting thing. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes down-to-dirty pre-code action / adventure, nothing holds a candle in 'Tarzan and his Mate. The infallible Tarzan Man's Ape is a kick-ass, violent and devastating season. I doubt there will be another Tarzan film in the future that does not take prisoners the one way to do this. You should be strongly pressed to find a full scan of this movie that should be approved by the Code, or Animal Rights-Approved for this matter. Vibrant violence does not even wait for the happy forest couple to show up before it pushes the same limits of today's cinema adventure. After T & J enters the picture, there are many early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swim. Watch it for yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this movie. In the first movie, Jane seemed like a market contradiction, like the writers back then just did not know how to show a character like that. But here it is a great precursor to kick-off women in later movies. Although it still requires Tarzan's Assistance to get it out of pi jams, it's doing more than just waiting around to be saved. His personality is perfectly credible for a woman who lived (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched this with my mother, and I enjoyed showing her just how much Jane has Tarzan "train," as Jeff Foxworthy puts it. It totally has the man's brand in it every beck and call. Although there is a host of effective dated effects throughout the movie, there are still many cheats to raise Tarzan vs. predatory battles that are made (mostly) for real. These and those-dress-as-wills are a lot more convincing this time around. ** SPOILER ** The film climates as the jungle erupts with a shocking result of the devastation of animal kingdom that leaves Tarzan and Jane from the only people still breathing. Although the couple rides at the sunset come together with victorious, I can not help, but imagine how this story will look like in the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of people who went to find Tarzan and Jane and never heard again. ** END SPOILER ** One thing that constantly affects me is Johnny Weissmuller's list, bathing and over-styled cats. Otherwise, this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It happened a night (1934). Next movie: Twentieth Century (1934).
