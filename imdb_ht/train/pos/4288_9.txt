Rain or shine out, you enter a movie house. It makes you happy. (If not, come straight out.) Lights go. You settle down with a bar of ice cream. Moving pictures begin flicker on the screen. You feel content. In the darkness, you are back to the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... look at modern versions of flames cops 24 times per second and share the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the storyline and the rest of your family / viewers. Those who are unhappy with themselves, should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedy ...)
