I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. It's one of only a handful of movies ever made that I would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details on this movie should be in the words of Frank Zappa "like dancing on architecture". He absolutely hitting the nail right on the head in his way capturing the floating moments of life that moves us and then runs away so we never have to experience again. This looks like the movie version of charlie's charlie's movie adaptation of films wanted to write. is the end that remains open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. There is no real life lesson, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids explores the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings ...... love romantic. <br /> 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
