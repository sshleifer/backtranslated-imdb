Actually this movie is not so bad. He has action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy from the "Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Call" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was very good and also funny, but the one most amazed me was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. She plays a different character than she usually does, because of other films such as the "Green Mile", "American Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" she plays a very sympathetic person, and in the "Apa" play almost The opposite, a man without any emotions, was beautiful to see. The only really negative thing about this film is the several photos of the World Trade Center, which makes this movie maybe a little date. Overall I thought this was a nice little movie!
