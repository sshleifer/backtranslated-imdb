Gray Gardens is a world for itself. Edith and Little Edie live in near total insulation, ice cream ice cream and cake once in a fortin kitchen in the rooms (apparently) to share. The chat about while Mother Edith insults her daughter's elation. This is a Tennessee Williams play coming to life and should inspire screenwriters and dramatics, as the rare and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50 -a daughter lived for a decade (other than that was poor and clean). They would bicker all day, the grandmothers talk about the beautiful glorious past while her daughter always blames her for missed opportunities with men, work, and self-expression. This movie is a must-see for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship in this type. It's sad and bustling, but the filmmakers have done an amazing job getting Edies are comfortable enough to expose themselves to recklessness. It's rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context - remnants of a powerful family manicure in anything at the skeletons of their own castles.
