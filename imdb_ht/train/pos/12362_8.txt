I'm going to be quick to address the affairs of the movie here: It was a very tangible story about the destructive qualities of all consuming passions; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her political-radical fiance pride (due to part of her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approaches to life) to get awe and passion into a new young lover who she enters into a sexual relationship clearly and. The anxieties, rage, tenderness and passion that whirl around around the atmosphere of the narrow narrow displacement that seems to swallow from the leads. He lends the film an energy mood that enters the entire political conflict that is otherwise lost on the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics for 80 years). I found the movie compelling ... what it lost a bit is an oral oral sex scene that the actress is doing on the male lead ... it's not fake with the little leaflet imagination. There are other scenes in the movie, which I feel was necessary because they describe the insanity and loneliness that the characters live in. But the oral sex scene, I feel, that focuses on the actual story. It was smoothed up to this point and once the sad sex scene appeared (which caused lots of hoopla back in its day), it's like hit an obstruction. He joked and unnecessary and I am in the camp who believes that the film should not hurt any if the scene was removed from it. And unfortunate is that this particular scene can discourage people from watching this intriguing movie, which I believe worth a look because there are lots of things below the surface, emotions and turmoil more layers of the subtext. /> Overall: Beautiful movie is hampered by a very unusual scene.
