I'm certainly glad that a movie was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story. As it did during Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people in all minority groups who did not want to settle for an expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear as playing in Cuba Gooding, Jr. leads to examples of the conduct of life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who embeds baseball and making it sticky to his character and conduct. As Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly does make it really clear to get more out of life than he has gotten. <br /> But while Harry Truman integrates the Army Service after World War II, the Marine still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer's spouse, the real fighting parts are denied him. This is not good enough for the Strong to become a deep sea deep sea diver. Once in the Diving School in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all thrown into it, especially by the Chief of Staff Petty Officer, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some rest of prejudice, but it's a hero and someone who can inspire anyone to get through the racial divide. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men in Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Strong. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performance reminds Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the school diving, a marine guy just wants to retire for the reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> Men in Honor are an inspiring story about those who have the courage to reserve and the ability to change.
