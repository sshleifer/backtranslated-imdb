Let me first state that while I've seen each episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in basement basins and attend conventions wearing costume and rubber tipped point. I gave this film a seven casting on the fiction of historical mistakes. The act was better than average, but the draw kept no surprises. They tried very hard to reverse the technology engineer but still the special effects were just a big one. Now, as the historic errors, if you call them, the first Capitan Pilot Enterprise was Commander April, then Tackle Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk, we removed the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (which is why a first directive was created), but as I said they have no reason to discredit this good series. I hope that the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat.
