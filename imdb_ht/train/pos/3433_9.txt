I saw this first in a movie movie film. It's a very bright nail-bite on a conspiracy to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion dollars or so golden. It's all injected into a brave, genuine genres that Hollywood rarely uses - but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less angry in 2003 when I was there ). <BR> <br /> There are a lot of humor and some romance, too. I do not want to spoil a number of surprises yet logic surprises, so I'll just say this movie writers start out in a great script, and directed and their performance is top notch. KNOWLEDGE in TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of his genre --- I would put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it in miles ahead of the new OCEAN 11, though (deliberately) not like brilliant. RENT OR BUY IT NOW.
