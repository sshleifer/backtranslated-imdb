In order to stop her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being exiled back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decided to marry her. Only other problems and that is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two have separate lives when one night after Albert's birthday, they fall into bed and then in love. Later in the movie after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert in cheating and shows up to his work a late night after closing. What he finds will let the viewer stunned men. This is a great, very original movie. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in the roles that it is amazing that they were not best recognized for their work here. Very controversial about its liberation in 1978, the "R" rated film is now "PG" at that time more liberal .. Recently released on DVD, the disc has a "broker" segment of the special features and in it He stated that the film was based on a current story for viewers who say the movie is not "real" to make mistakes. Everyone is a person and different people fall in love for different purposes - these are the issues exploring in this wonderful movie for all those who have ever loved!
