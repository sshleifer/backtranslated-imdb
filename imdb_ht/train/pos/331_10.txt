This film in 370 minutes was revealed by the Italian public television during the early seventies. He tells you the myth of attributing Homer to the Journey House in Odysseus after the Troy war. It's an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilization, said in 500 years after the people where they spent events, around 1100 BC .. This is a 1969 film, so if you buy the DVD version you would find that The sound is just mono and no other language than Italian, the same caption is Italian. Pity. Many would like this masterpiece if he was on the English translation list. But if this is not a problem for you, than I would recommend watching this movie.
