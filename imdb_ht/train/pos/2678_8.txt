Hey now, I can not claim to have seen all the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and have to make sure there are many of them, but this is one of the best (and weirder) of the lot what I have to see. I would say that most likely he was in his first turn back to sixty-late sixty-early and anything recently was a bit too weird to me, and it took a lot to declare it. Anyway, this is such a big bad dream where the party it seems to come true at various points. This woman is an actress or something, done in some theater in Berlin where acts of "fake" torture are designed for an appreciative audience (?!) And it seems to have this problem and dreams. Catching in what's real and what's not in this movie is apparently the real thing is to sharp focus and the dream thing is not. It seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I will not say this makes a lot of sense but it is beautiful wood and weird and fun. Vaccine in Berlin makes it seem like a lonely and creepy place, so that adds to the atmosphere. The finish is very abruptly the same, the movie just ends with the tape going black, I guess not need to let you know it was about at that point. My copy came from the collection Anchor Bay Euro-Garbage, and I say, giving me more Euro-garbage, I can not get enough of that crap. But it's good crap.
