Good working time with Quiroz Brothers, and thrown at all on this project as "The Guy on the bench." I was amazed as they accomplished capturing all the features identified in a true "B" movie horror. Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after being completed and publicly recognized on several occasions since the release. One time was actually in the video store and the damn girl near her mind lost. It was very funny and that was my first real autograph when I signed up to receive it. One day I asked the girl in Blockbuster if the movie is renting frequently and confirmed by looking up at the computer. At that time he leased over Ring2 that was also a new release at the time ... The title really captured immediate interest in the more urbanized markets. He also noted on many occasions the film was not returned by the customer who led me to believe the movie is just good people do not want to give it back .... Look out for ZoMbIeS when in the Hood cause they will get ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Ban-2005)
