This is a very difficult movie, and it's almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on. At first she seems to have a rather pedestrian movie on a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather criticizes inviting herself to one hour when the actual (a) woman committed suicide. Then the twists and turns start. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why do tenant clothes turn to the apartment? A wonderful, finally, if Trelkovksy _is_ the tenant before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the Polanski tricks pulling on us is to tell you lies. We are supposed to see things from point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions in reality. We assume when the camera shows us things from its omnibus point of view that we see current - but Polanski lies in our camera.
