Very slick, very pre-Hays code, and it's still very sassy. I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. It's funny, it's sexy, it's hard-working - and love that lets it become! Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a dozzo of a floyzy that arose in the world, perfectly portrayed by a gaming building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Play one of his first conquests. <br /> <br /> Last three minutes are a deception, but the lines, the clothes are all added to one heck in a film about rising vertically in the horizontal position.
