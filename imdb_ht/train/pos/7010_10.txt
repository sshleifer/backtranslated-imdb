Before I see this film, I see a lot of comments, which everyone has a great view of the movie good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to point out is the acting Woody Harrelson No, it may not be in many parts of the movie, but when it appears or even intro, I was amazed by Will Smith and Woody Harrelson's "message" tried to create and possibly slip the entire plot until the end really understand what's going on. <br /> I'm not a very sensitive person, I think a good paper should not have any remorse or pity behind it. But an act of redemption, there are not many films in my viewpoint that can be shown. This is one of them capable of. <br /> I agree with someone who commented on this film that shows "suicide" acts is a fall, however I do not believe the "message" movie is trying to send, but "sacrifice". A bit of the extreme, but that's the message of my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential. Acting in it is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from someone who does not really like watching movie drama ... if you love this drama is a must go look.
