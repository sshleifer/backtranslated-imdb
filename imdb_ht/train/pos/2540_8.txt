While not as famous as some of the other collaborations (like the black cat and the body SNATCHER), this is a little frenzied little movie though the casting decisions were somewhat odd. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a stranger scientist who lives in the Carpathian Mountains - near the town's character Dracula's character. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality has never been discussed if the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have the two roles changed, as the Carpathian role seems tailor made to Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this weird twist, the two still did excellent work. The Karloff was definitely the lead role, but Lugosi freed himself as a relatively normal person - something he did not play very often in film !! It seems that Dr Rukh is a bit of a bet, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theory is rare and meaningless. However, over the course of the movie, Rukh turned out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has nasty nasty effects in turning it into a crazy killing machine (you do not hate it when it happens?). While this could just have been a pretty nice scientist turned mad story, the draw was well constructed, the nicely developed characters and the angry Rukh was NOT a killer, but complex and interesting. Movie is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for those who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures pulls all the stops and makes a larger-budget film instead of the cheapies cheaply from Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately the gravity of years later. Good stuff.
