I did not like the Fire and Apocalypse Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite Vietnam War movie is the Deer dog. Hunter's hunter focuses on part of the war, and then focuses on life before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too low compared to the Deer Hunter. The story never develops to the point that the audience can really understand and feel for the characters like Deerhunter did. Vietnam revocation is not as attractive or involving as such in Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> However, I think the act was exceptional. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They totally immerse themselves in their characters and express the anguish of two old friends who lost Bobby's best friends in combat. Harris's character is a half-dead alcohol, which conceals the culprit that he has at Bobby losing his life trying to save him. <br /> I also like to throw in support. All of the city is part of the movie. The city obviously can not handle Vietnamese veterans very well. Like many small towns, it's all about being quiet, humble, and one's business idea. Character Harris', however, can not be any of these. It is interesting how the human war effects. Some people quickly repel, while others never really recover.
