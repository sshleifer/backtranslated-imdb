I do not know why some guys from US, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who did not watch this movie - look at it. Do not expect too much or do not set some just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor - people in Serbia were actually married while Bill Clinton bombs the towns, gypsums in all the Balkans still try to f * ck you up in any way they can, LOVE still unexpected, The most colorful and colorful, with the Balkans are very creative. For those who claim this is a bad movie I can see only that sh in the American (such as Dave Meet, Finding Smart, etc.) are much worse than a better quality, movie films movie humorist movie films as my promise, . The comment should be helpful and the second place should be represented by the staff of the writer. I think the movie is great and those who watch it should give the respect of the director and story told inside. It's simple but true. It's brutal, but gentle and make you laugh at death.
