There were so many film and television production Jane Eyre each with the recommended features, but I suspect this is one that people are still discovering and falling in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers much more to the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; Its performance is amazingly agile and very colored, while never wrapped too far from the dark complexities of the character. Jane Zelah Clarke is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she does a perfect paper for Dalton (which, accordingly, towers on it!) The nuances of her performance come in better on a second look (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical faults with a couple of times where their production value could be better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standard at that time. But it's the performance that is the real pleasure. Do not miss this one!
