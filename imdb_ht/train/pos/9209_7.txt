Star Rating: **** ***** Work Just missing the mark *** That little small between ** Set back behind * Hole <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is peacefully do her way in the Wild West by stopping a group of people suffering from a lady. When a gentleman, he naturally steps out and puts a stop to this and by doing so to kill the son a nasty enforcement. This is just the beginning of an all-gun gun lit the finish battle that will be one winner. <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star that never really managed to take in with me. Perhaps I discovered it too late and after the movie other I saw him in his last Monday, Human Shield, it was just another dude (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something for western, the film was just sort of transported me to a different time and place and provide real entertainment escapist this Dudikoff took one of the best scripts he, as his films go anyway. <br /> <film hits a few low points in the form of a naff central villain, sounding like an empty Marlon Brando and some ropey generally acted in some of the cast, along with the obligatory cheap sets. And if, for some strange reason, your life ever depends on watching a movie Dudikoff, this should be one of your best choices. ***
