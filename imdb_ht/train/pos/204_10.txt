First of all, I'm gripping almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something about this unique, which draws me to, and I would say it is among the most fun comedy I've seen. The second time I looked at it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmother? <br /> Well, scared they could call, so it changed them to men. And how dull it would be if only housewives, show biz stars is more fun. Well this is a personal review, and my grandmother always lives at age 97 (he even survived Walter Matthau's Imperation!) Would deny it - but some of you must get the resonance of these characters. Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow it turns into one of the best performances I can remember (and even grandmother even likes it, although failing to recognize similarity they are remarkable to share with characters in films) br /> <br /> Very ethnic to taste, and on the top, you'll either laugh and laugh or turn this off. For me, give them pleasure.
