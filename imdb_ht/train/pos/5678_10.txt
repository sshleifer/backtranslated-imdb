We could still use Black Adder today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resumed the role of assistant prime minister playing by Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as Prince George's Prince and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode that Kenneth Connor invites stars as a British thespian. Each time Edmund tells Macbeth. Two thespians make a comic little acting in the devil ward. Read the funniest things you will see. Of course, none of this brilliant and comedy genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who are behind these films like Love Actually, the Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and a Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for TV. Humor can be smart, sexy, and funny all in one. I was hoping last night on Saturday night that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his background in British humor. If the gang of SNL did some research, they would know what a treasure it was Hugh Laurie favors stage.
