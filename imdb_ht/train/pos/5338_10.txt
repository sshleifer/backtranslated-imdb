If I'm going to watch a porn movie, I rather have some sort of draw, and a descent dialogue. Behind Door Doors are one of the few people I have met with these attributes. New girl new door scams on human nature and human weakness where seduction and gender is concerned. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the actress choice to play part of the seductress of blackmail and play the grandiose part. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and very beautiful actress. The movie gets in a total of 10 just because it's in it. His partner in the movie, Monique Alexander is a definite cutie. The two should do more work together. In this movie, though, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have a whole lot to make or say. That's too bad. It seems like it has more talent to share. I love the girl who (possibly) the next DA's wife. I forgot her name, but she's pretty good looking, and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious that the party has bought a pay. Which is okay, but does it end? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid his performance here would have dropped the few rating, except Chelsea's talent and beauty avoided any negative. In general, this movie is a good thing.
