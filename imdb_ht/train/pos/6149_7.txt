I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with great affection from childhood and it's certainly made for the curious afternoon entertainment. Beds definitely make more sense in its full form, the deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) events link together quite neatly. What a little baffling is the scene stage being remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack of this foot has been lost or damaged, so some bright sparks of Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogues. Which would have been great except that half the cast did not around doing it (some for better reason than others) and the whole thing has a rather high quality of it. Some of the lip-synching is very poor, and David Tomlinson's voice was dubbed by a stroke that sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (there's actually a hint of German in it, I think). However, good hearing versions are full of all the songs (although 'step in the right direction' is still absent) and the moments of magic in this movie are always bright. And I challenge you do not giggle when young Paul gazes so innocently at Angela Lansbury and coos "but that's made with my knob ??"
