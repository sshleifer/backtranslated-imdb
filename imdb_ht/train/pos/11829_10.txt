I was watching "Dick Tracy" for years, and as a result he became a major part of my life - he was with me to all children and I used to see it quite often. Seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - black, satirical and incredibly unforgettable. On the only thing that can be said is Oscar's nomination Pacino has received - other than it is rarely discussed and did not make much of a fuss when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is over-top but in good effect as it clearly has loads of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera managed to capture the atmosphere of a comic book comic book better than any other movie, maybe I've ever seen. Just take a look at one scene in the movie is breathtaking. The lighting, harmonious velvet and smog / smoke combine to create a great effect. There are some really funny victims including one by Dustin Hoffman as "mumbles," and I do not think there are any flaws in all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected. <br /> Overall, a really fine film that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underdeath with only 5.7 / 10 average on IMDb. The critics' reviews are very positive (check out RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity. > <br /> Very Recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
