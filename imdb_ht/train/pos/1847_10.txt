Whatever you come into your life, you should never forget that you have root. This is the story of true reality that made in a beautiful movie and moving! I dare say that this movie is well underrated.This shows us a reality in life ... The worst evil surrounds you, the best ones you become. In your instincts, be aware of the ideal In life is living happily ... without grudges, without living "under a rock". The film concept is much more interesting ... to connect the story with real life events ... keep us aware of everything ..from reality emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism it's about how to live your life!
