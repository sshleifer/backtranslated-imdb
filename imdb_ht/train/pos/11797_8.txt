Power Booth is hypnotic as the leader of Jim Jones who led his followers to temple in the temple from 1953 until 1978 when he led them to a mass suicide in 1978 where more than 900 were killed. A very well-done movie that looks like a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 to 10
