I do not know if this is sitkon or not, but I agree that this is one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's great that this shows always when. And I love Michelle. She is beautiful about the episodes when she was a baby and she talked, and she sometimes said something funny. Aw .. <br /> This show can relate to kids and adolescents and .. well, families as they struggle in rough times and try to work it out as a family. I do not know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone. I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. The older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt, and she learned a lesson about robbers. That was a great episode. An example that shows this TV shows the family working things out like a family. <br /> I recommend this show for everyone.
