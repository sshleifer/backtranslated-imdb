This is a very unusual HK movie in many ways. First, many in the sequence of actions really are not so much fun. The very first battle reached the movie was just funny. Not cool funny, or even funny funny, but just funny. This does not mean there are some big action scenes, but most simply do not come to the level of some of the films I've seen. The opposite side is that this movie actually has characters, not just people. All of the main characters are interesting (except for the bad guy, who flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well-off. All the protagonists in this movie are just fun to watch. The dialogue is quite witty, and does not seem to lose much of translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope independent U.S. audiences do not think this is HK that's best to offer.
