But another run in South Park comes to an end. This was not such a strong an episode as I would expect for, but the night of the homeless living was a stronger finisher when the Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary, or Erection Day. She still can not hold a Woodland Critter Christmas Christmas and Goobacks, but some episodes can. <br /> Night of the living room is a parody of the zombie genre, making in such a way only South Park would think of. Instead of meat eating meat, the homeless entities that change demand and seem to survive in it. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are close to the Community Center, though this time on the roof, where they can survey the scene. A particularly awkward moment is when a member finds out her home away, and she becomes homeless, leaving Randy no choice but to shoot her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys set out to solve the problem, and the history behind the homeless control control attempts to convey a message, but they were seriously uninspired. South Park is at its best a lot of times when it is being ridiculous. Matt and Trey played it safely this week, and he did not really criticize the homeless issue, just lampooned it. <br /> <br /> The moment of shock in the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid homelessness. This is the first time a suicide on South Park goes wrong, and we look to the poor man to miss his brain, and then try to shoot himself many times while he suffers death. Another inspiring South Park moment. <br /> Overall, the episode was funny, but it was kept from being great by keeping any real real on the homeless and sticking straight to the shtick tool. The finish is a bit funny, but nothing new. <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next batch of episodes. It's a long haul, but South Park must applaud her to run. The show seemed to be running out of steam last season, but now it's back to complete form.
