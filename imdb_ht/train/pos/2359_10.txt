I think if you asked most of the JW if they expect a miracle healing because of their faith, you will find them doing so. I know I do not. What you will find rather is that they believe Christ's promises are made in a resurrection. So, even if the worst happened and we died while maintaining our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct it. <br /> It really gets down to a simple question: is your real God or that is all just to believe? If it is real, and trust it, you will follow his direction no matter what the short-term result may be. <br /> I had a heart attack over a year and a half ago. One of my relatives was afraid when he saw the word "NO BLOOD" written in big letters on my board. I thought with it that if I was in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time only the only anger could return me to life when the time came? He did not find it - God just is not real enough to him. Too bad. I wish he could have the comfort of a solid trust given.
