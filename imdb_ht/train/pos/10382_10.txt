Like all the other reviews, this film was a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library to research all that I could about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all of this, all I could find out was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900's. base with it, a copy of VHS in the movie. There was another bidder but I was determined to win this movie. The lost Master wrote me asking for a copy I gave it. Although owning a copy, I'm always digging and researching finally finding a site that sells a DVD copy of the movie.
