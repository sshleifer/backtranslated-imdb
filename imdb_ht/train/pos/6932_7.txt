WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with finding his precious possession, a repeated rifle by Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stewart doggedly holds after it. This 1950 B & W effort by Anthony Mann is more a crime movie than a traditional western, and the Cowboys often seem more like modern-day gamer than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman in doubtful doubts who led for a hip and a man (Charles Drake) to be married. It ends up falling for Stewart, but not before it's been going around a bit. Winters are the most complex characters in a movie filled with unusual characters. Look for a young Dan Dureyea as a Nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very great role. An evil curse Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
