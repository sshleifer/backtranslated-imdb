One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I do not know if anyone in our country has not seen this movie! It's funny, and sad at some moments ... I do not know how did people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) accepted this movie, because you knew some moments in our story of serbia and character in Serbian in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it! But as I see here, someone in Canada has been watching her ... and she likes it. <br /> I think I will try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first find out how to do this ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
