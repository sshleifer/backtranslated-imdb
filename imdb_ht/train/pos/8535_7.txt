This work is a bold look at the attitude of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. This movie will never try to tune it down, cotton candy, or soft bitter soap, confusion, and pain to what these guys live with. That's his strength, I think. But more so, their performance is fantastic, and well conceived and delivers dialogue, which draws you in and makes you feel part of the experience. Characters never try to block out the audience from knowing what's in mind-what's in their hearts. <br /> I found it plodding, but enjoyable. <br /> It rates a 6.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
