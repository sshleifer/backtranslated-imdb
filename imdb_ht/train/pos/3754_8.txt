I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoons in the 1950s or 60s. It was well presented but I remember there was a message of hope broadcasting of transmitters secrete to lamposts in one of the latest maniacal executions for next release. I'm not sure of the squares and facts. <br /> Always the movie is well done. The German high-ranking commander wryly without emotion "The Russians are moving down Fredrich Street" as if all went according to plan. <br /> <br /> It was my impression of this film and an American event later made for Television hit-off based on British Trevor-Roper's historic account by a similar title to Hitler's Hitler. I was surprised to see no Trevor-Roper credit. <br /> I agree the latest German film on the topic DOWNFALL was as well done as the classic. The American knock-off was a little flat. <br /> <br /> There are many figures to attract many attention to the movie as Adolph. But I find it interesting that no of the many films and books that have ever been spoken by Hitler's double accused are happening in the historic John Toland piece. <br /> <br /> Are gibs?
