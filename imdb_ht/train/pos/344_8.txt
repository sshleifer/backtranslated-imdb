Another entry into the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves in your local video store. * * * "Nerdy teenage kid takes revenge on their 'cool' kids' wrongs" trait will of course be accustomed to those who have watched it before. And those who have seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are waiting Ingmar Bergman and will immediately become angry over time wasting should just skip it. Marilyn Manson on the belt with David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy - go with the sink and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the creepy mask.
