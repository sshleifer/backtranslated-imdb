This film is a true reflection of the Australian resource that is required to make this country what it is about over 200 years. Do not fire like the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans. If one of these countries tried what this crew did, it would fail to move. Either due to ignorance on the British party, or excessive confidence in superpower over the American side. "True" Australians (that is not imported) are the only ones who can be exponents in modern military conflicts because they have to impress most of their adult life. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
