I own Ralph Bakshis for forgetting fire and ice over an old video rental OOP. <br /> <br /> Well for one thing, this is better than any other Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cheese, but who cares? He stopped the test in time, and the only way he began to look cheese is in modern fantasy era comparisons like LOTR: FOTR (though I like that film.) The draw goes like this: After a fight between fire and ice , a royal daughter is kidnapped by animals Jarols (ice) subhuman, while one survivor in a victim city rescues. Betty, but that's not the point. It is really bringing in life an interesting idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <a world of two enemies: fire & ice. And it succeeds. <br /> As for the action scene: superb. They are well occupied, there are terrific suspicions, and they are very loud. Just check out the climatic battle, now that a finish! <br /> Acting and dialogue: Competent. Really. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are OK and do not get over your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. Shot on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. A lot of the origins look really dull and well drawn, and although the character designs feel a little 1-dimensional, they are OK. In general, this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the supermarket "entertainment". 10/10
