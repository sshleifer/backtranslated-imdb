I've seen it in the theater and absolutely worship it. Geoffery Rush has given the best performance as a super wicked who I've ever seen since Hackman Gene as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a maid of heaven. This film also presented to William H. Macy, who is currently one of my favorite actors. Hank was as big as the Blue Raja, and I especially liked that the character was not really British. The scene with her, saying to her mother that she was a superhero almost carrying tears in my eyes. I liked the fact that the bowler was talking to the ball. Some of the funniest things involving Stiller and his character Mr Fake angry madness, and the fact that its threats and one-material were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop myself from applauding when she said "Fraculater, Freinken-cha," said. But one of my favorite things was that amazing Captain actually died in the movie. I highly recommend this movie for any occasion, and I give it my own two-inch.
