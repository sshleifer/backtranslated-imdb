I love this presentation - I was weak House and I know it is so hard to present all the book as it should, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have admitted to have made a pretty good show with Nicholas Nickelby in scene . I love Diana Rigg and I could see Lady Dedlock pain, even in the arogokrasi expected in the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think it's Dedlock's best lady ... I'm not sure who could have done a better Jarndyce, but I'm OK with Mr. Elliott. It's not easy to book Dickens' books long ago - Oliver twist would be easier - this is a long, and if you do not care for all legal situations they can be sad or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough not to bother. I just love Mr. Little - it can be fun. There is still a child - You will break your heart here ... I think we should give a chance to judge for ourselves .. <br /> I must say I liked the show. Perhaps if I read the book again, as I usually do, after seeing the movie, maybe I can be more critical. In the meantime - I think it's a good presentation.
