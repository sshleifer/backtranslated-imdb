Frailty - 8/10 - It's non-sensitive title and "Bill Paxton Director" title aside, this is a very good old rip fashion snorting biblical horror libraries. In the end, it can only end up being bowed to the South Gothic bond of Kubrick in the "shining" - but hey, that's a nice humorous notion. He also got a doozy in a draw twist ... and a very messy moral message. This is the kind of movie that year out of now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus from themselves looking at it. Too bad director Bill Paxton went to hire himself in the star ... well .... still a demon in a good rent.
