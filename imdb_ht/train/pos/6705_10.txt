And it's not because since his day on "Clarissa explains it all" that I had a bit of a break on Melissa Joan Hart, who at this time shows that this was popular already well in his 20s, but he has always been able to find young roles. "Sabrina, the Witch Adolesan" was next to Hart's growth following her "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a young witch who tries to swing his magic magic and the demands of everyday youth. She is assisted by her initiatives by her two aunt and a wise-sized cat when she attends high school, college, and finally her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual , Hart is the show of the heart & soul. "Sabrina, the young Witch" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was. I only wish there was some more episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> 10/10
