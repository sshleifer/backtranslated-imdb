Never seen this movie, based on the novel entertained by Nicholas Katzenbach, and taking into consideration the first cast cast for the production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause", while not a horrible movie, takes too much freedom with the original material that Jeb Stuart did not succeed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher led. The first thing we think when a black boy is spread to the local polls for interrogation is police brutality. After all, Cherif Tanny Brown, with police officer Wilcox, does not show any mercy in beating Bobby Earl, who accused of killing a young white girl. We feel frustrated by what the officers did in the prison. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother sent to the north to ask a distinguished Harvard teacher, a senior lawyer, the young man wanted Paul Armstrong to defend him. Her old woman is convinced enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the innocent young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man serving time at the same facility as Bobby Earl, comes forward to tell about how it is connected with killing the virgin, and dynamic changes in the case. The way she plays in the movie, she uses to confuse the viewer and distinguish Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller was enjoyable by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a fine impression as the Sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why she is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting their roles. The film, even with its faults, will not disappoint.
