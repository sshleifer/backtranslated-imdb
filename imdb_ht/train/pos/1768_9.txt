I do not laugh this hard in a movie in a long time. I had to go to an advanced screening, and was thrilled because I was dying to see her. I had tears from my eyes all around a lot of the movie. The whole audience shared my laugh, and he was knocking and crying in all of the movie. Kudos Steve Carrell (which I was already a fan). She proved in this film her tremendous talent for comedy. It has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God did not have a comma from Will Ferrell (love her, but seeing her too much this summer). There was part of the comic genius of this movie. In addition, thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). Scenes of waxing with the speeding Dater and the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go see '40 Years of the Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see her for great laugh and an incredibly enjoyable movie about herself.
