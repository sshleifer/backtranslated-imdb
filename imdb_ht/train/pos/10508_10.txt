Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cakes. When Mario came there, he found that Bowser had kidnapped it! Mario must save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants. It can just roam around, climbing trees trying to look for 1-ups, finding secrets of level, and more. You can spend four hours at one level. There is no time limit. There are 16 worlds, and a number of steps, and there are stars, which you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you get through the stars stars, you must go through a stage and battle Bowser at the end of the stage. To get into certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going to a painting. There are many things to do with many hours of gameplay, I do not see how anyone can dislike this game. It's great. This launch title is the game that the N64's gamers would have a good life. Each 3D flat-shaped game we know of has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have a N64, buy this game. It's hard to get used to, because no one sells this baby for 5 bucks in the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
