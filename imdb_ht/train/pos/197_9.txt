"Wisecracker," the biography of actor William Haines, offered an enjoyable anecdote on the former star when he was over 70 and long retired from making movies. The old glove was not sentimental and rarely watched his own movie, but in 1972 he was heading off to Los Angeles's Screening Museum at Montreal, the silent sequel feature of which he co-starred with Marion Davies. Before, Haines was worried that this comedy would induce the wrong type of laugh, but he was pleasantly surprised (with no doubt relief) of how he got up and how many young audiences enjoyed it. Watch the movie today and you can see why: Show people is a delightful Hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lights its goals and wit and flair, yet without malice. It's still funny with satirical points it always reminds. Needless to say, the technology of making films has changed since days are silent, but the pretensions and folies of the filmmakers themselves have not changed all that much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Where his career was concerned Davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of his rival William Randolph Hearst. It is well known that Hearst has been enormously influenced by Davies' choice, and well-known that, despite his gift for comedy, he preferred to see his play heroin dignity in the costume drama period. By late 20s, for whatever reason, Marion has been able to keep things in various commercial light commercials (including MILL MILL and PATSY), but showing people, led by the great King Vidor, stands as pure showers his enjoyable. William Haines provides an engaging, favorable performance as his companion and co-star Billy Boone, but this is the show's leading lady all the way. Marion plays South Belle Peggy pepper, an aspiring actress that Hollywood storm accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star. (Colonel Pepper's father is played by actor / director Dell Henderson, a veteran of Grimmith's Biograph drama who coincidentally looks like Hearst!) One of Marion's drones bits, often extract elsewhere, is her audition in the office Studio casting. While father helps suggests emotions in show ("sad ... [...]" and drops a handkerchief in his face, Peggy points out that appropriate expression and posture. She has been hired, only to discover that Comet does comedy Low-brow, the kind of comedy where people inject each other with seltzer and cops inept dry on every other circuit to the rescue. Of course, commits to being intended as a Sennett's Keystone Keystone, but the true nature of the satire Clearly as the story unfolds, as Peggy peeps up in her movie star in Comet for the studio's studio more prestigious studio, assuming the name "Patricia Peppoire" as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress. It can happen to us (as it did in view of the viewers in 1928) that Davies' Gloria Swanson rival started out of Keystone comedy before he climbed into the importance of serious drama for Cecil B. DeMille and as Miss Peppoire more and more seriously, providing the high-hat treatment in the Native colleagues such as Billy Boone funny comic, Davies' performance takes on an element of vicious parodies seemingly aimed at Swanson himself. This is especially remarkable during a series of interviews, when Miss Peppoire's spokeswoman decently whispered while the star delivers an imposing image of Swanson. I think this was intended as a friendly parody, but I must ask how friendly relations were between Gloria and Marion after this film was released. <br /> <br /> In any event, Show people is a delicious treat for enthusiasts, who will be unacceptable to the parade of stars at all. Charlie Chaplin contributes a great bit, makeup sense and distinguishes herself, hurrying to look for Patricia Peppoire's Otrograf! (And in a show of good sport Marion Davies himself put in a self-mocking appearance, the evening note for pleasing fun in Swanson does not poking pleasure in himself.) This is a silent film that viewers do not specifically adapt Silence might be appreciated by at least those viewers and a flavor for movies on the movie business. Show the sown people of the company in the classics as SUNSET BOULEVARD and SINGIN 'of the grape, among Hollywood most productive products, enjoyable exercises in self-test entertainment.
