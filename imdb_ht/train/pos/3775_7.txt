Take me: A jump, yet imaginary chaos. <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as the two punk-rock iduots at the end of this season-trotting comedy BILL adventure and TED's excellent adventure, now a classic cult. At the end of this, Bill and Ted are giving more time than travel in time. They might as well travel heaven and Hell too! During the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "fight in bands" competition that can make them famous more than ever. Meanwhile, many years of a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (still the occasional George Carlin) runs a university praising Bill and Ted's name. There's an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from the chicken to October) to get rid of the stones of the stars once and for all. So it sends two similar responses to Android (In the words of Bill and Ted: Our Robot) does the dirty work. Thereafter, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way into hell, and those who are happening include duo's worst memories, and then in heaven in an attempt to return the earth to preserve for their girlfriends ... and their shows. Along this trip flying, playing board games with none other than death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in 1957 classic classic SEVENTH SEAL's aid, aids help from a couple in intelligent foreign beings and more. <br /> The BOGUS JOURNEY array of excellent effects of the special effects are not up-to-date standards, and even some of the humor and the look of-and-the-time are a bit dated (to be honest, the movie feels also as it was released over the wrong year, even for the 90's). But with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performance and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative, and yes, bogus. from 5.
