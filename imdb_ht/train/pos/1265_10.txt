Hi .. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite movies, Sean Connery, it's a psychological suspense thriller and excellent performance at the cast, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good at this one .. It also has one of the best scenes ever in movies when Sean Ed Harris' character interviews is just fantastic .. I enjoyed this a lot and I can not recommend this enough, really do not miss this one! By paying attention to the negative reviews stating that last 30 minutes of sucking, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really get Just Cause a Very Fun Movie ..
