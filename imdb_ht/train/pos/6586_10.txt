Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, narrowly sewing out the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of a short story of Conon-Doyle. <br /> <br /> A long adaptation includes some new scheme sections that fit in well into the surrounding drama and expanding hate to one feeling for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance all round, especially from Robert Hardy, with both Brett and Hardwick completely rounded and comfortable in their role to make this superb piece of drama.
