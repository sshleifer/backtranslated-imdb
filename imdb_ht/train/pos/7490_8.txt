Until today I have never seen this film. He was filmed on the sets of Old House in Black and Frankenstein and worried a small Bayview village where supposedly giant sticks suck the blood of the villagers. Frankly it's a bomb movie that has atmosphere for supply and a throw that will not leave, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play a character named Brettschnieder who is in my interest since that great girl my grandmother. a carefully watched film with suspicion and witty a Materio that slowly builds for its short run, only will lose itself when about ten minutes before the end they realize they have limited time to wrap everything up. From this point at the end of it a run straight the finish with very little of the fun that preceded him. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a long run in 71 minutes and warns of shorter imagery. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are from a source I trust more say the full run time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia) Quibbling about what I know is crazy but since most Writing available tends to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if only its 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not matter much since it's five minutes and I doubt many will do or break the movie. What ever the running time, if you like old movie, do not all mean, watch this movie, it's a big black movie and night weather.
