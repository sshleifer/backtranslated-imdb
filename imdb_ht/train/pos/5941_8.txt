This is a movie casting fan of pretend to be a preview for a new and exciting Batman movie! It is the movie fan that adores fans and looks at places like ComicCon and was made by even those who did BATMAN: Dead End, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie goes, I could easily pick it apart. Ensure the CGI effects are not perfect with the costumes far from perfect. But this was done on a shoestring budget and for a fan of this movie is incredible. I was particularly impressed by the Buff Superman - she was no little wimpy guy! If only this was a preview for a real movie - they'd have fans lined up here from Omaha to see it. Good job.
