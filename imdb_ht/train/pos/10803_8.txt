I do not understand. Not a criticism, I do not assess the quality of acting, which I find credible, good. My confusion lies with the content. Is there no other person sensitive to the fact that these two faithful women have justified their infidelity to men who have struggled with bleeding in guaranteeing the freedom of continuity in their families and their countries. Should not there be a prologue that tells us if the guys did it at home and, if so, what effect they "cheated" wife "infidelity was on them? While these women were bedding parrots out of a loneliness Sure, they thought that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or decommissioning everyday? They did not think about their husbands at all! Only to themselves. Forgive me, except when wanted their husbands to die.
