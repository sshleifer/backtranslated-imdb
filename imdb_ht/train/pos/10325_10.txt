I brought it to Doc Savage, and was petrified by the green death as a child, but even then as now, I found it quite fun. I did countless friends with colleagues watching this movie and they They were most amused by the diversity of reaction, they were granted mostly to think I'm odd but there are you. "I do not know what it is about the doc, but it always gets the girls" had to be the ultimate line when you look at her sad band of people. This film is a classic parody of all genres of super heroes, and it was way before it's time, it does not have to be taken seriously, moving on Austin Power. Ron Ely is a God. It's unfortunate that this movie has not been released on DVDs in the UK. I do not think it should be remade and bastardised, as I said it is a classic, it can not do without Ron. (Like the Italian work without the Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
