I absolutely love this soap. It was one of my favorite. Is highly recommended :) ... I just love the Brazilian soap, they deal with real life events. I'm really sad that the soap has ended but I'm sure I'll be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out to be the end for the bandits. The only thing I would change is the end for Xica and her longtime love. I can not wait to see it again and highly recommend it. Xica was far away, the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you all love it as well.
