I have seen this film many times and I will not be tired of it. It's a classic in every sense of the word. The film is humorous humorous and yet well touched at the same time. For those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or in foreign films in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for the "Beginner" because the story is so fun. Do not get me wrong, it is 100% Japanese (and that's why it works), but everyone will find something out of it (though it's just a big laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever seen!) <br /> I do not even think of this movie without smiling! I love it ... and I think most people will be too.
