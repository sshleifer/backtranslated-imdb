"Saving Grace" is never riotously funny, but it delivers quite good laughs and I enjoyed it to a significant degree. Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress, and does a good job of portraying Grace widow, which resorts are growing marijuana to pay her massive debt. Thrust in support also does a fine job. French actress Tchecky Karyo has a little funny role. The first query is appealing. The idea of ​​a woman on the mountain is growing and smoking smokes funny sounds. And the movie plays around with the quote wisely every now and then. Of course, there are moments of flatteness, such as one of the elderly women's Grace Marijuana's herb leaves for leaves and they begin to pull antique familiar to the store where they work. That was a stupid stomach that did not take well. The movie film is downbeat and occasionally dull, but I got enough laugh to give this input to a referendum. <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
