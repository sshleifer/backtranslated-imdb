Was lucky enough to be an extra in this great movie and love every minute of the filming. Was going to the prime minister in London and there was a great Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon cats as did my wife.Fantastic after party too. Then a few weeks later traveled to the cinema and members of our bike club. What a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the big biker films. Now we have the DVD to my wife Sue can not get enough of her and the kids. Get a bit of stick to the club that seems to think I'm a movie star now oh well one can only dream. I think they're just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow up to keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck
