Drama Wars that took place in Louisiana in 1971. It follows a bunch of recruiting in basic training and then Tigerland - an accurate portrait of Vietnam on American soil, before they are embarking on. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how to meet, become friends and deal with a corwardly squad leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a boundary. br /> <br /> An Amazing Non-Commercial Movie Directed by Joel Schumacher. It uses a camera but has been kept in most of the movie and uses digital video for combat scenes. It works very well - the movie looks fearless (as it should) and unmatched realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covered up its Irish brogue and adopted a very compelling South accent. His performance is just superb - it's a very talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. It's tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very bland. The rest of the cast however is just great. <br /> This movie was thrown away by its studio. He had no star in it, a familiar story and was considered "just another movie of war". It only played a week in Boston! It is well worth catching on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Also, Farrell and Davis have a naked nude scene.
