This thriller thriller is sort of like a noir movie, though changing the context from post-war to the Cold War and having something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", the policemen are good guys, criminals are genuine guys, and the only enemies are the "Komi", which ultimately differs from the good guys in that they are emotional practices, driven by a Real care for their own is worthwhile, as shown by the constant tracking-in close-ups that speckle the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The personality of this movie is rather unique and detailed: Skip the selected peg who can stare down any danger, and sometimes while going through all of their personal assets; MOE informer who just tries to save up for a spectacular funeral, but that manages to take the hearts and respect of almost all the other characters (and the audience); Candy, the sick named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing the government work and does not fully understand the plot she has involved with; and Joey, former badie Commie's badie companion who tries to hide everything from everyone, and ironically, is the worst person to do it. Throw in a very colorful, supportive character (like the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen) and "Pickup on South Street" treat you in a beautiful personality as they drift down the mysterious and accidentally stealing microfilms frames. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
