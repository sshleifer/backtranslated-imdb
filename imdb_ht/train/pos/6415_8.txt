Drama TIllman Jr on the first African Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), challenged all luck and achieved his goal despite a strictly trained coach. Simply not bad, somewhat extreme at times, but the direction and act is first-rate, and this film is inspiring and accomplishing what it is supposed to do. I liked DeNiro in the lead, although he's not on par with his mastery work (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it's as good as his other good performances like the King of Comedy or Angels. DeNiro is still convincing and credible here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his best performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, Rating: 9/10
