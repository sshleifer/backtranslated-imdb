It's sort of crazy, but I was stuck out of both TCM, this german version of the MGM's "Anna Christie", and the English one ... but I got to see this one first, 'cos I would hear that many people thought it was better than the English version. <br /> <br /> Without having to see the other one, I can not compare them, but anyway this is an excellent talkie early, with a straight-out performance from the heart by Garbo. It looks pretty much in this movie, her face shines at all, especially when Cameraman William Daniels, gets these gorgeous close-ups in her. The atmosphere of the film looks different from the regular MGM things that made about that era, it looks much like the French movie or german expression from the thirties, well it was directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who was Led Garbo in 1929 in the "Kiss". Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolute credible performance as Anna's sweetheart, hard-boiled, hard, sailor, who's just a kid in the man's body. Also, Hans Junkermann provides a very good performance, such as Anna's dad and Salka Viertel as well as a good-old cheap cheap floozie. In all an experience, because it's the only movie you could listen to Garbo speaking in a foreign language ... 'cos all the other films he did in either Sudan or Germany, were during the Silent era. <br /> <br /> Grav Flick.
