Now this is what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror is used that limits it to its advantage. WENDIGO, while occasionally flawed, is a triumph of the imagination. Granted, he leans heavy on EVIL DEAD style camera moves for its humidity, but it's still a damn eye better than 99% of direct video grille. The story is very simple: a family takes a vacation in a remote cabin and they are threatened by one particularly unhinged hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build suspensions and adds to the unsettling Christian layers in the use of the mythical Wendigo. Is it real? Is it all in boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the child's emotional state? Some <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some have been convinced that the movie is unsatisfactory because it left you deciding. You must not put in by these nonsense. A movie that makes you think is not one to avoid. It's one of the joy.
