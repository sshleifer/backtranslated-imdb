A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally killed a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tried to cover it. Otto Preminger's directed film has a lot of atmosphere, but the story gets watery when the dead wife (Gene Tierney) falls to Andrews. He did well to dig himself into and out of a big hole, but it was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir movie. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a crime boss who Andrews is obsessed with bringing down, with the tension between giving his film to his energy and driving, especially a scene from a bath house with Merrill, Andrews, and Neville Brand, and The night outside appointment at Bellevue Hospital, which sets up what should be the conclusion of the movie. Highlights for atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. ... and the general painter of the underworld, though the charming and clever angle cop cop copement elements do not help its cause.
