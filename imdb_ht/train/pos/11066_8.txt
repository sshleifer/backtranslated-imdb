For a long time it seemed like all the Canadian actors were directed to the south border and (I guessed) all the second runners ran full of cracks and left the dregs for their sex comedies. This film was a real surprise: despite the strangely familiar plots of farces, the actors seemed to try to put something into the characters and what we, the viewer, had returned was almost true suspicion of belief. When the extracts from the music video attack the obvious police, you almost believe it was possible. <br /> If you're a fan of some of the best sex farces (Canadians or not) you should definitely seek this one out. With the great surprise, this sex farce is also packed with some pretty good nuts.
