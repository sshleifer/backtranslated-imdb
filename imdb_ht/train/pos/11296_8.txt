I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just from high school I got a job in Fox 20th Century as a member of the workers and Hod Carrier Union. At the end of my first day (rapidly pile of a plane company) I was told to bring a suitcase in the morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks. When I arrived in the morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. Just short of there we stopped at an army base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked off we went north a few miles from Pendleton's Great Marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, including a water tank, shoveling weapons, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. All this was at great pay, sometimes 'golden time', which has tripled our regular hourly earnings. Our food was also the first rate = first rib of lunch, etc. - was amazing because it was time war and very difficult to get good meat at home. Once the work was finished i waited for the movie gets out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited for two hours in the movie before my worker finally came on screen. Then he was not more than three or four minutes (perhaps less) of the film's hero diving bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. Something disappointing, but always fun. <br /> <br /> In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this film was included by the government and Fox was paid at a more cost basis, which may have been due to pay us the morning and form down. Bob Weverka
