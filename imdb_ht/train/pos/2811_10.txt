Silverlake life, look from here, is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS as well as on a gay love relationship. Some images are really really hard to take, especially when there is only one gay or fears about AIDS, and probably for anyone sensitive to watching it. It's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences on not only one, but two lives. This movie teaches how to take care of each other in these difficult times, but it never gets too morbid, it always shows life at any time, reminding you that outside the theater or in your room, life goes on, regardless of the destiny of some people may be. Characters are incredibly endearing, while we look at the intimacies of vaccines that never go beyond a very strict limit, never revealing anything too privately or offensive. Children should certainly not watch this movie, but grow-ups if they have to deal with such situations or not, they should do it, and they will not regret the tears of water.
