You can call it a mystery, perhaps a little thriller, or an intelligent movie. The story takes you into life one who lost his life and is recovering it. > <br /> I was told I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. It's not usually the genre I care for however the characters quickly became people with me and I wanted to know what they were about and what would happen to them .. Just like many French films about English did , we are able to learn more about the character and the affect of their environment. This movie is driving character and will not disappoint!
