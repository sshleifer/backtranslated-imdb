Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> The "Gentleman's Destiny" theme is recycled in many films spanning many different years. Its theme ranges from the recent parody over the plots (see "Scrooged"), in the same same, most severe and dramatic notion that worked in "It's a beautiful life," and a much earlier century in the history of Scrooge as told by Charles Dickens of "A Christmas Carol." "It involves an incredible man who took on a guided tour of his life and witnessed how his life could (or would have) first hand. <br /> In most of these kinds of Guardian Angel movies deliver a man from unbelief and show him his life in retrospect, or how he could should have been ... would have been .. In this case we are shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi) Li Hated his life. He lives with an unmarried wife (Linda Hamilton) and waits for a bigger life and greater significance. If only he has hit the ball at the state high school championship year he is convinced Life would be better. Remember that momentous moment in his life because he had a huge impact on his subconscious side, but I doubt a man would grow up craving for one act from high school. Still, He works in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> Anyway, Larry drives home to work one night, where she is a penpusher along with Jon Lovitz, when hi s car breaks down. in a bar looking for a paid phone, and reluctance to decide to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) on the way his life turns out. This is where we first saw her remembering her childhood baseball. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and nods, apparently do not worry about any other customer. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, though old and tattered, seems never been occupied by any survivor of these guys. In fact, Larry even made a comment on never seen the bar before. This is most likely for a reason that the audience awaits before Larry. <br /> So, the bartender, who can as well have an angel angel, just like Clarence, stares Larry a special drink at him, which ends up putting Larry's life back, showing him what His life would have been as if he hit the house running all of those first. But Larry has no idea of ​​any change at first, just like Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence was erased his life until he entered the bar and raised out Larry continued to be oblivious to any changes until he Go to her home to find the lawn differently out there, and a great, wrestler-type man occupies his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon to get out his life would indeed have been very different he had hit the run home. Instead of getting married to Linda Hamilton she married Rene Russo and moved to a large castle with children. He finds that Jon Lovitz is not his friend yet, but an employee of it. And the most surprising reality of all is that with his new life, which Larry has always wanted ... he finds himself lusting after his old wife, Linda Hamilton; The evidence that sometimes money and a great-looking wife again do not make up everything in a person's life, as a clever wife and love with true happiness. Just like "It's a nice life" has shown the audience of life a person is what he does, and that each person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, a Lessons teach us over and over again, but never quite so fluffy, forgettable and really sweet as it shows us in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Destiny gentleman" is never very hilarious, but it's a sweet, good-natured comedy that has never taken too seriously. The problem with all "It's a wonderful life" rtread out there, like "Family Mom," is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It's a wonderful life" was. But there are only so many times you can single-handedly rip into a famous movie, and "Mr. Destiny" know this, and play the right reality. It does not try to be anything it does not; Instead, it is something he did not try to be, and this is obvious with the audience. <br /> <br />
