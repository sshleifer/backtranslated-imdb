I had many expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something incomplete for an evening. I walked out of the theater totally happy and somewhat surprised. This is a very good film tribute film, and a nice lesson about chasing your dreams. Dennis Quaid made a mastery of his work, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full cost ticket with a couple hours of your time!
