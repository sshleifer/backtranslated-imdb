It's funny how your life can change to a second ... To go to the 'Waterdance' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life may seem scary, and in noticing that others go to a similar situation he can help you to go on. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performance and especially in Helen Hunt (oh man !, Helen is the purest and graceful woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your recent roles. A simple film and at the same time the funds do not get left indifferent to the transmitted message: enjoy every moment in your life ... Really in a movie like that any hour not going to !!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
