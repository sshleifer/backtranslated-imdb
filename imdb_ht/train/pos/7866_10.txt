PAGE 3 **** from 4 Stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Concorda Sen) enters his companion's house with its blank. She looks here and there and then goes to her room and you get the picture - 'Ah! another girl ?? that baddie two-time and yes indeed his distribution of it but it's a GUY this time around. And I say 'Brilliant!' <br /> END OF SPOILERS (the scene above is not really a stoker ... but for me it was so I did not want to take a chance) <br /> When they were Ask about how this film, my friend replied 'oh, it's just an exposure to the P3 people who made me believe that sick will watch a stupid movie if nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought of myself '' I'm best to get a pen and a paper jot down the bad things on this movie 'but I've been proven entirely wrong ?? and then some because I could only hone the assets. This movie was great. Huge, not because it is offbeat with non-commercial movies such as scenarios but because of the clever of the scenario and how does this movie tell you how to handle a brilliant film that could be a mute and meaningful movie if given by the wrong hands . /> <br /> Concord Sen Sharma is grace. She is so beautifully damn that she rolled her role perfectly as though she was designed to play this part. One of the best actresses I've ever seen. But this is not the only performance that is good in the movie, there are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Particularly Sandhya Mridul who just fire up the screen. (And guess what even the very crash Tara Sharma speaks normally) <br /> <br /> The movie stars cut off with some funny old party of the silent-sushi celebrities in the movie industry and go and get the idea of what movie will be over. And for about half an hour in the movie you feel just about the same. But then the movie picks up the tram speed on a good storyline and never let go of it. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement ?? 'It was a good story, Madhvi'. (Thank you). The big thing is that it tackles the problem of how funny those people have style and do not do it on doing and also tackles the social issues and not make them boring. At the end it all roller coaster rollers and Madhvi inform us that not just smiling at all of them. Just the reason why I love watching movies. Unstable film-making movie. The scenario is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
