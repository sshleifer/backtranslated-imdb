Yes, Shakespeare would indeed have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at best but it certainly is not bad. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His point was wonderful as he was toying with the audience. Very nice job. There were too little drama times where more would have been expected. Cassio's soldiers, for example, were somewhat observed by too much happening apart, causing the spectator to twist itself to grasp it all .. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? Her craze was strict to Roderigo was weird; harassed even. <br /> If you have not seen Othello before, see this. If you do not read Othello, look at this. If you have not heard Othello, see that. You do, on the other hand, make yourself a favor when you read it, see it acting scene and hear it sang as well.
