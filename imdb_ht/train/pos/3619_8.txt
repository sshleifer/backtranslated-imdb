Despite the best Disney effort, this is a rather enjoyable movie about tracking your dreams. I was surprised that he did not hit me as submissive; This movie played just. Dennis Quaid was very, very good at the role, saying something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies have little curiousness that bothers me; here, everyone looks like the party. This movie is amazingly good, and I predict it will make business surprising as it is a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert Conversely, this film is a success.
