Well, would first like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated it means "protected". Khakhee on the other hand refers to the uniform color police (which is Khakhi!). <br /> Also, the Tamil movie industry is rather full of purely commercial initiatives, any Rajnikanth or Vijay movie would stop additions to that statement. <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an excellent movie with a great band. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, especially enjoying the finish (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is a great movie!
