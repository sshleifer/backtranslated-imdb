Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This twisted hole in a movie revolves around 80 cultures of Heavy Metal and Horror movies - two things that I love fondly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me very easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a high school high school that, like all our losers, ended up dipping into a world of heavy metal "bad". His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected - by playing his latest unreleased album back. This allows the corpsified singer to go to murder of demons and sh * help out. Okay, it's very cheesy at times, but you know what? He received a surprising number of good qualities. Dental acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), very good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this "uber-wrong" metal guy is one of the most reckless, high-capped, lamentable, Motley Crue rejected on the planet - and the "metal" is little more than banding 80 pop / hair metal. He hit all the clich√©s here, from turning around like a gay fairy, looking mean, to scream "Rock and Roll Press" at a high enough place to make King Diamond retch. Aside from craft music repression, it's actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
