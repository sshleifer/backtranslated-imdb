Clever, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is firmly arranged among its best films! <br /> When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a rare stranger, the victim's child joins a whore to uncover the killer. <br /> <br /> Dresses to kill leave a strong impression on the hearings of its day and for good reason. Palma creates a dramatic dramatic story that starts with an intriguing setup and builds in a full-fledged mystery of strong suspension. The final and the conclusions are especially 'nightmarish'. It's a really corner of your seat trauma. Even more impressive though the Palma's elegant direction gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique atmosphere and darkness of its own. Dressing to kill is also a very erotic movie, but especially in a weirdly beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a good music note to the movie. <br /> <br /> Throw is another strong feature of this movie. Michael Cain makes a physical turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the sick housewife. Nancy Allen performs as a street-Walker involving solid. A young Keith Gordon also proved to be a worthy supporter as the son investigates. Many people criticized De Palma's film for having Hitchcockian elements and this movie was no exception. But any similarity between Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be seen as a quality, such as calling this movie a 'RIP-off' would be degraded by a fine thriller. Dressing to Kill is a must see for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
