I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was over. I always remember the 1st episode called "The New House." She scared the h * out of me! I can almost always hear that status, laugh crazy. And finish, my God! The spirit comes in the room for the child: Yikes! This was classic TV and was one of a kind of quality. I found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My Question by Any Reader: Is anyone buying this set? It's a bootleg. Both the claimants seller have very good copy. I have an excuse and poor DVD of "New House" episodes, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better, however, if someone knows if these are more obvious it would be worth it for me to buy and share with me kids. A great, smart, scary, and expansive supernatural series. Thanks in advance to any fan who has come down to down on any of this- In fact, I'd like to discuss it. Chris Walker
