For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching movie independent and alien and lying in my head that I loved. The bus drive is exceptional. It's the truth. It is the best "bad" movie ever. "Badness" in this film seems to come naturally. Half of Satan's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Bridget's celebrity is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store clothing. It takes the unique couple who keep trying to kill each other FOREVER to walk down the stairs. Jesus walked into a funk band. <br /> <br /> Anyways, greed gives the impression that someone loses ways to counsel an elderly's film project. But it's the sincerity of how bad it is to make it so wonderful. You get the impression that the musicians knew he would be bad, but never forced it. Never to be duplicated in wonder, fatty salvation. Very highly recommended.
