I think this has the potential of being the best Star Trek series again, I say potential ... we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of mind ... but i hope NOT! For those who have not seen it..SEE IT! Without annoying "PRINCIPLE DIRECT" floating on top of each other when they encounter race it might be cool .. and Scott Bakula was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe too hot, (Check out the decontamination scene ) I gave this a full 10 ... it goes far beyond the unlocking other series .. I hope this goes longer than 7 years ...
