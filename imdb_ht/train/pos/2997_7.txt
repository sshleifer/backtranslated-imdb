William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Case of Death Killer," a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo entered his Scottish Terrier Captain served as the background for a locked room mystery and many suspicious troops. The mystery is very clever and devoted to both complicated and interesting. Since the parody is still very young, the camera work is a little static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job that directs the action. <br /> <br /> Throw in support is excellent; Throw at all to bring the movie up a tooth. Many of the actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-Blan, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell has played it most (five times) and is best fit for the role - very relaxed, but serious at the same time. This was done before the "Man of Thin" catapulted him to his big star - he spent about 12 years in film by then starting his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence with a remarkable actor who lived almost 92. We are therefore lucky to have his movie available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Faller can be dead" is a great story with a fun movie - do not miss it.
