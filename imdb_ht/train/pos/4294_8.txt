There was not a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema, saw this gem in a movie of a sold-out home as part of Hamburg Film Festival this year. And tears are all laughing. This movie was hilarious, there's no other way to say that. There was not one boring bit in it, I laughed right through it and everyone else in our three hundred lovers of French movies. Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific. A great clown if needed and serious if the situation requires it. The performance was of course completely on the head, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. Equally big was Charlotte Gainsbourg who I love to see a lot, and the mother was also a very strong performance. Sisters could be a bit more detailed in script-wise characters, but apart from that there is nothing to moan about. I had a great afternoon to watch this film while Hamburg drowned in rain outside, and I wish movies like this from France would get a regular release in Germany. But the distributors this country does not seem to understand that the French makes good movie. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia?) Because that movie I need at home to watch several more times!
