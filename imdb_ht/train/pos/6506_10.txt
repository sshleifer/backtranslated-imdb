Outterly brilliant. Powerful and Evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made about warfare. It's tone offers a strong deal of the often gung-ho attitude towards World War 2 which displays the media. Rather than choosing to scream about the horrors of terror, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat of the true images of war: widespread bodies, explosions, fearing citizens and soldiers, broken people, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands in life, the suffering of the innocent. Most of it really brings home that humanity is capable when all normal rules of "civilization" are removed. There is something hobbesian thing about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a slower manner that can be crimes that are still traumatized and captivated 60 years ago. Perhaps there is a series of follow-up called "The Century of War" for the twentieth century was really the century of horror. I feel it is an irony of immense sculpture that it took an event that caused the death of 50 million people to produce as a compelling and excellent series like this.
