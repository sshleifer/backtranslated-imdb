Finally, having released a good Blaise modest film, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the story "real". I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect a thriller action, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just telling about how Modesty became the wonderful person he is. It's not a movie for attracting new fans, but a movie to tell the real story. There are some things that could be best, but when you can not forget the terrible movie from '66 then that's a very beautiful movie. So you're a fan then sit relax and just enjoy that the real story is there and a cover story just make Modesty tell her story.
