When I first read the plot of this drama I suppose he's going to be like Sex and the City, however this drama has nothing like it. The character's characters are more real and you empathize with the more. The concert of the same drama, four 30 women women guide us through friends and relationships with issues and constraints along the way. Katie GP is a black and brooding character that you get hard to relate too and is best friend and Trudi a widow. Trudi's character is warmhearted as you can relate to the difficulty he has with the fact it is the only mother of the card. Jessica is the very smart little girl party and knows what she wants and how to get it. It is a versatile character and closer to Siobhan's newly married wife who loves her husband can not help her in the wake of her work colleague. Over all the drama is amazingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series it might do well. It is unlike other women dropping drugs such as gender and city, or desperate wife. This if played right could be the next cold feet. Plus the men throw them bad on the eyes too.
