This film is completely ridiculous. Not only is the sad plot, but the act is horrendous. Special effects are artificial and the entire film is placed in a post-apocalyptic desert. But it is by far the most fun movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes to laugh due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino. There are also other aspects that I will not spoil, just because of what makes these films so marginal. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiosyncrasy. I have no idea that would look this expectation to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, look exterminator of the 3000's!
