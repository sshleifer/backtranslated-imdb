When you come from the Philadelphia suburbs and are very interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage look at Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are downtown scenes, a train station that does not exist, 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as the northeast scene of the city. Good shots in the old-style house as they appeared then. The film gets a bit "chatty" at times - causing the viewer to temporarily lose interest ... but the overall scenario is solid and very moving. Anyone who liked this movie should also try to see the film "Bright Victory", also with local footage at Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and the downtown scene of Phoenixville. Army Hospital became a college campus. Both of these films are out of any format and I can not imagine why. I have both on VHS at home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend to any other story enthusiasts from my area!
