SPOILERS NAN. <br /> It appears that von Trotta was a lot more to facilitate and to what the balance of personal history versus history of events than was in her earlier film Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> The direction looked closely controlled, and visually I felt it was very attractive - especially where the visual narrative was concerned (the title-sequence mix with the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating death of various characters in the past). <br /> To clarify two points that many people were confused by: <br /> <br /> Firstly, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this may have seemed implicit, it was not the intention. From Trotta told me so himself! (And it's a very nice lady, by the way!) Second, the time frame of events was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are shown on the close-up of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence that Goebbels was annoyed about doing so, and he planned to eventually recapture what he was wearing for free. <br /> <br /> Overall, what most impressed me most was that it was an original story that came out of a great 'on-movement' era. It looks like a shame that it took such a long time (for various reasons) for this film hit our screen. <br /> <br /> The more the same, Margarethe!
