Here's another movie that does not really need much of a recommendation. It's a classic, very funny and fun comedy that, of course, finally inspired a series of successful TVs that many would say was even better (I enjoy both, personally). For some, it is difficult to cope Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on the TV show starting Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we had in both cases is four good actors in real life looked very much like their movie counterparts that they managed to make their own characterization. It's Neil Simon's humorous material that's key, and where the laughs are really originating out. <br /> For those who have somehow never heard of the ODD couple, it's the story of a neurotic and fervently clean-freak (Lemmon) who is cast out of a 12-year marriage by her long-suffering wife and take up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Wet these two roquates easily together in the same four walls to make for some humorous predicament.
