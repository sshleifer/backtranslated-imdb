I first saw this film almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite) MATE. I was in the school with the mumps and I was totally wrapped in the movie. I had read about buying videos for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my favorite actor ever and I think it's a travesti that she was about to look many times when the Oscars had come around. I also think that the queen should have knighted her as it's easy to do as much for the movie industry if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the movie changed from black to white to color and back again is well done and the movie has such stellar actors as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance at Richard Attenborough.
