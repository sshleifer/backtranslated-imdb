For starters, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around to bind them to laugh (check out the Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney scenario, but that's one of the good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to lift their cricket to the end. And she also had a couple of great-voice voices by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, each ant looks different, beautiful origins ... And the guys and girls of Pixar have made it all look so realistic. All in all, a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin.
