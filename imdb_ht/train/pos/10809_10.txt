Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a huge variety of human and sorrowful passions. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the tolerance of others gives the way to saving humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachin and Lil. I replay the scenes over and over again. Anyone ever loved in love will be sympathetic to these people. All the characters are cast and depicting good.
