A few summer summer caverns have actually been accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen of ships was running short. A person was sent to a space station for gas tanks, etc., etc. First of all, this film scheme is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling of anything possible if you put your heart in. <br /> It's amazing to see these young actors who always look at the same after many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in the year 2000, it was filmed in 1986) There are quite a few people in that film that still works in Hollywood. exterior space. It does not look real. It's about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you will not even notice. You know that it's not real, but you just get sucked in it until the end. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good family movie.
