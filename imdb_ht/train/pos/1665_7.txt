The film looked like a walk to "Immoral Studies". Most likely I have never received so much that involves the burning need of the female artist to immortal men men and thus all that fuss about "Now Who Draws This Penis?" sounding a bit free. Dialogues in this film are rather terrific, albeit visually this movie has received its moments. I almost searched it when Tassi got to paint a mental picture, but then films weered back on penis. Very recommended to those who have not seen one in a short time.
