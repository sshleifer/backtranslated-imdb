When it comes down to fairy fairy, Cinderella was the one who made you cry the most. Poor Cinderella is a girl who has all her life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepisters with a slave-driven step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we got to Cinderella witnessing animation. Before the story starts, Cinderella and his father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. To share her wealth and give her daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father marries a woman, but then dies afterwards. The stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella. <br /> So, for many days, Cinderella is a slave mom-step and her step-sister. She has hope, however, thanks to her friends, the mouse in the house (sounds like Cinderella did not play with a full deck.) She hopes that one day she will get to her prince. The chance eventually comes when heads of the country need a girlfriend. <br /> 9/10
