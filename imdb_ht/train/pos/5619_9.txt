I once lived with a roommate who tried suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar riot burden for sneezing after midnight - so do not mean I can easily relate to Polanski The "Tenant." <br /> But I love the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure that it works, on the whole - Polanski's character's descendants of Paranoia and Madness, which takes up half hour or so, seems rather jarring and scarce. Ebert, for one, was totally convinced, and she slapped the movie with a vicious one-star review. But I think that individual scenes and moments work very well, so even though I do not quite understand the whole movie - what Egypt has to do with it, for example? - I always have a positive overall impression of it. <br /> I love the obnoxious friend described Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times I have been established to have stupid friends like that instead of having no friends at all! I like the movie theater theater - the funniest "make out" moments in the film story, I would say. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - it's so foxy in this film, it's almost incredible. And it gives a great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is a good actor, too; I do not agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about its performance here. Her character is supposed to be low-key and thoughtful, so its low-key performance is suited. I, for one, found it perfectly sympathetic - even though she lost me a bit when she started to dress in the dragon for clear reasons. <br /> <br /> Yes, the darkness is dark. And slow down. But it captures the amazing looks of living in apartment - something I did entirely too much - so I searched it. It's funny how all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a kissing movie like this becomes deeply meaningful! Definitely worth picking up to change pockets on DVD.
