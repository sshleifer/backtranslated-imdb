I saw the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe I say that. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a story that is tied to his own. Two are thrown into one of the most exciting and intriguing stories in any animated film. The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disney's work in Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality of their production. He almost bought them for stealing the story of Kimba's white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki films have been released well! I can not wait to see an English version of Nausicaa!
