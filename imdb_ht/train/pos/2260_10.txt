A good movie good! One that seriously confused. The songs that children sing in the movie gave me a sense of pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts a good performance here, but the best performance of all the movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. I wish he was in more movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.
