So I flipped over the digital subscriber channels a night a couple of years ago and thought I would spend a half hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for the "Hart war" to begin. With a title like that I figured it had some OS 'B' flic on gang girl gang gang. Many of my surprises it was not about that at all. Instead it is a well-acting, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her baby to her practice session and finding interest while observing her. As he does not really want to be a boxer (only after his father's wishes) he convinced his coach to take him over in his seat. <br /> The story unfolds in a clever and credible way as it goes through various trials on its quest. For starters, his brother's coach does not want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so has the problem of lining matches. Then the confrontation with his father when he found out what is going on. Yes, a love interest is developing but it is used to improve the plot, coming across more into an inter-human human interaction with its own consequence of consequence. <br /> All of this is a great movie few travelers seem to have heard of. Some time later when I saw a lot of advertising and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby" I thought "wait a minute, this looks familiar." Needless to say, I did not look at the "Hart war" that night.
