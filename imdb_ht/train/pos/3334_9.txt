I really liked this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie. This film is about Lindsey that meets Ben in the middle of winter when baseball season is not in. She falls in love, but when spring comes along, she gets the shock of her life by placing one step lower on the pedestal it's Ben put it on. <br /> It's a funny movie with all baseball mania that Ben has. She can not be part of what she likes the most, so it's so funny and why many women can deal with Lindsey in real life. Also the people are sitting and in the baseball games as obsessed as it is. <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not strike out if you rent this one.
