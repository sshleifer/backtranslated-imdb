I saw this first movie at a party. There were many good movies, but some kept me thinking about it long ago, and the Insomniac's nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted cinema. The vaccines were great. Distribution was perfect. Dominic shone in his role as he perfectly manufactured. There was not much to know about her character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we care about her. And Ellen - I can not wait to see where he ends! She showed a lot of talent and I hope she's got a few more movies. With all million budget budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, Tess shows that it's all not needed as long as there's a good story with actors. Kudos all people involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and Co. to distribute it on DVD!
