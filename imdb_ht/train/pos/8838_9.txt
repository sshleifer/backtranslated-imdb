Finally, a movie where the audience will remain guessing until the end of what's going to happen. Well, we all kind of know that the lives of brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) are spiraling down towards destruction since wherever there is going down, but we do not know how or when close to the end of the film. Hoffman is superb, as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the little brother who basically did what he said since he really can not think for himself. Hawke could be a little out of his element, but he played the party well enough. Added to Andy's wife, played perfectly by Marisa Tomei, copying and Hank; Andy's fundraising of funding companies to pay for his drug and sex addiction; and a father who finally discovered exactly what happened the day of the flight. This movie will make you think.
