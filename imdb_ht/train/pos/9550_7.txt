Despite the success of comedy or drama, Turkish directors are the horror-terrorist failure. "Okul-D @ bbe" is a good example of the awful Turkish movie. <br /> But if you look "There" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and obscure. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. Soundtracks to fit the movie, but the script is not entirely perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary. <br /> As a result of "Gen" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint fan thriller. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
