What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely lovely and the Scarecrow is a distinct and original. It really brought me back to the monsters in the 80's. The budget is obviously low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lens but it does not matter because it never once carries it seriously. From redneck trash trailers to the high-flying high movements of the scarecrow, this is really a gem b-movie. Grab some refreshments, snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much I went out buying a whole 3 Scrapbook movie. Be sure, they are not for everyone but for each one's own. Sometimes you just have to put the cap to think down and smile.
