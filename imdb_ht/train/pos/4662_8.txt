I just saw Miliono Hot on TCM and I completely forgot about this gem. Ustinov creates a clever and divisive scheme that has his cleverness going out of the minds of the mind ... Well you will see. Maggie Smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary / neighbor who has a hard time holding a job, but she has a warm and vibrant personality that is in the picture. It creates a fine painting of a warm, witty and real man in the running time ... well ... <br /> Molden and Newhart as top executives take over the challenge of doing what would be banal roles and making them from a funny life to their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know at least in the case of Romero Ustinov being extending a helping hand at work. <br /> This film is meant to be a back shot of computer age and rising with its problems for the average person or person for that matter but in reality the characters are so involved with their many pleasures See what the computer sub draws is almost lost ... I say almost. Leave down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great and friendly performances, forgiving and deeply involved drawing in this picture.
