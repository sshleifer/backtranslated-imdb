I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were incredibly over-acting. This was taken in the movie as they made the score fairly blame music notes, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the music score improved, I could neglected to watch some scenes. Then the movie would be a lot, better.
