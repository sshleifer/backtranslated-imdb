Indian summer is a hot, multi-character movie, which would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of correction). The film starts in the past with a group of kids showing a Moose, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting off the present, when an adult group from the "golden age" at the camp is invited back again to spend a week holiday at the top of the camp, Uncle Lou. The movie then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember the times in the camp, and forming the new memory of their last stay. The film succeeds in the great way it carries across its characters in this gorgeous environment, and allows them to develop their rooms without having to worry about plot development. Watching these people reminisce, and the relationships with each other is what the movie is all about and why it works well. It never goes to the top and melodramatic, always maintaining its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie where Nostalgia is captured well and found myself drawn in spite of never having been in one of these camps as a child myself. <br /> For a hot, nostalgia character movie, I sincerely recommend.
