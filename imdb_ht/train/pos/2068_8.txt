1958. Sleep the small town in Clarksburg. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (Vic Morrow's Movement of Nasty Peaks) crazy down super hard on speeders by force telling offenders in a cliff of their untimely death on a specially dangerous stretch of road. The daughter meets his match when fresh cool baton Michael McCord (a beautiful painting and brooding painted by Martin Sheen) shows up in town of his souped-up vehicle with specific intent to revenge the death of his brother (under Sheen's real life Joe Estevez in a camel knife). Director Richard T. Heffron, working in a script and intriguing script by Richard Compton (even the guy who led drive-in films "Welcome Home, Boys Boys" and "Macon County Lines"), relates The captivating story at a noise rate, neatly creating a period of 50's environment, and many skillful brides suspended out the tense game of understanding and additions between Childress and McCord. The well-justified exercise helps a lot: Sheen spreads a James Deanesque River ventilation vessel into the lead, Morrow makes the most out of his meaty lean bad guy, plus excellent performance supported by Michelle Phillips as Maggie's waitress waitress, Stuart Margolin as a Folksy deputy, Nick Nolte as hostile gas station assistant Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as indifferent Gawky Buzz's little brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as Sassy's local tackle Sissy, Britt Leach as Johnny Taxi Driver, and Frederic Downs as the stern judge YES Hooker. Confrontation in climatic vehicles between Childress and McCord is a real heartbeat-articulate that influences doozy. Terry K. Meade's cinema therapy, characters well traced (for example, Childress became obsessed with busting speeds after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and incident), the groovy, notes sincopat by Luchi De Jesus, with beautiful scenery hills all further enhances the overall sound quality of this superior made-to-TV winner.
