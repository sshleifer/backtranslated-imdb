A sharp positive political comment as a coming to great age is that this movie is. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. It does not assume but it does. This story of four boys and a growing girl in 1953 communist Belgium is a hottest heart. That's the guys looking at as a classic movie. Obviously, 1953 Belgrade is not as harsh to a dictatorial and fascist environment as the Communist society is often described. One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs is the song "Hey Babu Riba" ala the title of the movie. But jeans can not buy certain drugs that are illegal to own. Unlike a heavy criticism from a communist society this movie does not show how it affects the lives of the five protagonists referring to themselves as our maps. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and awaits a passport for her mother and she travels out to join her, the piano has been taken off from communion from one of the boys, suddenly giving off your home and the quarter of your newcomers because they need it. The boys spent a long time listening to music and making it clear that the communist crew was engaged in plagiarism and a fascist phony with Stalin tattoos on his hands. These all lead to the actions taken later on with the memory of a fading time away, as this film was released in 1986 at the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A big movie is worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also no friend."
