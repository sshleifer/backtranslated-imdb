I gave it a 10, since everyone seemed to love it and would have been churlish by them. The reason for my troubling is to add a personal observation about the Castle's work. <br /> I saw the "Omizid" and the "Tingler" (the version and sequence of smart colors where everything except the blood is in black and white) a few times and the "house on Haunt Hill" many times. <br /> Even I'm not old enough to see them when Castle was up to knitting her showman, so I can appreciate them for their own merit. And while most spend it as second rate, schlocky, army, etc., I believe they make it a bad one. <br /> <br /> The end sequel to "homicide" is fairly shocking and today's work - and citing the "Tingler" while funny, was very original. But the "House of Haunt Hill" was a triangle. Having used Frank Lloyd Wright home as his exterior, the great Vincent Price with a solid cast, plus a good score and production value - when I first saw him in a late-night charity featuring rhythm years Seventy late, it produced a hearing reaction I had not seen before and had not seen since. It was a bit where the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading now) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> No telegraphing of what comes, the camera slowly pulls back, forcing the HEAD to change look happy ... I do not say more (my "spoiler" statement only covers this movie). <br /> <br /> The point is, I believe that this plot has been DELIVERED - not crashing - and when it happened, YOUR HEADERHOOD (including most of people!) It took the audience on some minute to calm. <br /> Now that's superior movie-making. A flamboyant display he could, but "house" and other films I mentioned were GOOD MOVIES. Castle could not be a Hitchcock, but it did not Ed Wood, either. <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's crutches and forget to examine the Talent. So I hope this documentary recognizes that. I look forward to seeing it.
