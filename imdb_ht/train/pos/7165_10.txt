I recorded this age ago, but only got the rounds watching it today. I was so sick to run out of things to look! I'm so happy I saw it, and that I could delete my memory and watch it again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! She reminded me a lot of tomato sauce in the whistlestop coffee. <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said this is a movie. Agree - it can be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I love it! There was moment when my spine tingled. The story is unlike any other movie that day, full of adventure. I just ordered the book in Amazon, can not wait!
