This was an incredibly good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as Luzhin's tortured and brilliant genius shows the character's character as his strange dancing. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the tender lover Natalia. The relationship between failure and near madness is well explored by Gorris and luxurious Nabokov concentration as 'eternal innocence' (meaning 'Lolita') are obvious in this film . I think I will now go on to read the novel. It was an end to tragic touch and was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
