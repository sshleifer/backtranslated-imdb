Every time I hear a movie being known because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, bb. detectors go to. Generally, a movie like this is sentimental hogwash that panders to those who do not want anything to surprise them, but to emphasize how superior they are to dig popular. So when David Lynch's STORY STORY began to receive these kinds of reviews, I was scared, especially since I was not a fan of the other "uplifting" story, MOTHER ELEPHANT. For all stunning images and good acting in this film, he seemed more interested in preaching than inspiring us. <br /> I do not have to worry. STORY STORY is an honest film rather than a single sacrum. Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writer Jan Roach and Mari Sweeney say it is straightforward and simple for the most part. There are a couple of homeliads by Straight I could do without, and the shots of harvesting the seeds repeat a little too much, but these are only shrimp. There is no heavy message, but there are no sentimental strings to emulate our emotions, and there is no condensation for us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final stage, we are really moving. Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the party. He really is someone who looks like he lived in a lot, but still hangs, and except for those homily, the desire he had to come back with his brothers does not seem overwhelming, because you can feel here is someone who has lived too long and too much to be driven by anger for long. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make peace, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does good, works unreasonably as the right daughter. And although I'm a town with suburban boys, Iowa's and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least visiting some days.
