This was a strong Poirot / Suchet, television selection selection. Characters remained alive and well-acting. The scheme and the main environment - a student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me I did not distract from history. A significant point, many poirot monitors do not recognize good act or proper characterization. I also think they are rather difficult in the judgments of some of the Poirot mysteries. Finally, I read some Christie novels - Not in recent years - and get it hampered that many viewers are upset about changes from the novel. Please viewers, consider what's presented to you on film, not what you think would be there. That said, the Poirot mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as revisions and reporters would have you believe. With the singular exception of the Five Little Pigs being fabulous in plot, characters and themes, the longer Poirot films are neither good nor bad. For the record I've seen all the long Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, the film without lime, Hastings, and / or Japp is neither good nor bad because of absence. There is presence, however, is either trumpet (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
