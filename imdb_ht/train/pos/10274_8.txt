SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who conning who is here? When the hunter turns into the animal? This bravest, black film is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial field path, only to laylay you as you think you are safe. <br /> It has a fixed script, and good acting (at least from the drive). I did not notice the background music, but it never joked, so it must have been made right. <br /> I was very surprised that I loved this movie, because I'm not usually going for this genre but this sucked me off it holding it hooked until the end.
