1985 was a great year for films - maybe even big - but this one missing out on a gong has gone a long way in convincing fans that Oscar Ol is little more than a hood ornament for good party parts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not one title: these were the disadvantages of the Academy for one of the largest directors; with someone who had to wait another 8 years before the prejudices prevented her from abandoning her status before allowing her to give her 7 to Schindler's List, which is, arguably, not as good (and I half Polish ) br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I do not hit the 'harder out of Africa' (who won this year) either; but it was, in my head, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me into tears - and I'm not a big cry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (rich), but most likely simply acted: Whoopi, proving to us all that it was more than just a comedy; Danny Glover, whom I have never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at the time: who knew?
