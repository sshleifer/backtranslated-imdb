Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures myths in one of the most revered figures in the American history. Henry Fonda has a tough job to show a mythical face and at the same time make him enough people to take care of. He is perhaps the best performer actor. See how he just stopped a lynching-mob.Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman. Most of the last part of the movie plays out in a courtroom , and there are only lazy negative things I can say about this movie. Most of the characters from the audience judges are given to many humorously humorously folksy lines that are distracted from the serious trial of them. But I'm quite used to this because the humor is a Ford trademark. Supported parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
