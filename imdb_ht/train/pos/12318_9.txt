Though I'm not the biggest fan of film-based martial arts films, when a movie goes straight for whimsical rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this movie is one of the best in terms of Fantastic sketch and crazy fly Shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has been manufacturing here an enchanting treat and fine performance and many volatile beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunting house and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheenj performance filled with naive charm, but showing dignity with Wu Ma is appropriately off the wall as the Taoist brown, who shows off some swordplay and even becomes a musical number. Perhaps most of all, Joey Wang is the spirit of the fox, it's really a pleasure to see all the movement and seduction of seductive gestures. The film takes on elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all together in a fun packet. Ching Siu Tung, directing and touching the choreography gives some emotional thread to excellence, and full of films and nostalgia, shadow and ewoyi enthralling colorated jungle colors, giving each jungle scene a wonderful expectation. Also remarkable are the elaborate hair structures and gorgeous clothing flowing through the female characters, and, if I do not mistaken, Joey Wang hair sporting makes up like fox ears at times, a wonderful touch. Even though the movie features relatively little action and some may be sickly advised to sing cheesy pans at times, this is a wonderful piece of entertainment, with swollen character and draws, even the character of odd character, a close constant visual treatment equipment and luxurious luxuriant splendor. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
