As a kid, I liked computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, as I sat down in awe and looked at the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music, shaped the desire of me to create things moving around the computer. This is a whole-package deal, between the music and the video, which really packs a one-two punch. If you know any kids wanting to participate in computer animation, this is a MUST have. <br /> I always, almost 20 years later, this movie rate as one of my 3 favorites. The originality, I think, is still unsurpassed by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits out. I now want to see if I can re-do it on my own; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this film deserves a tone of imitation =)
