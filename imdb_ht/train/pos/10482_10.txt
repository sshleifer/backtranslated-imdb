I like this movie. It's one of those I can watch again and again. It is acted by a good cast that does not try too hard to be star nailed. <br /> <br /> The situation of a newlywed housewife who gets sold sells poison to make ends meet could be made to an American turd of a movie or action thriller. Either would have killed the movie completely. The movie plays out like an Ealing comedy with a feeling-good factor at all .. It is worth looking just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of corn ... (no this is not a beke!)
