I do not think this was a challenge to Richard Harris. This was a simple, but interesting scheme. It's a good movie to look when you do not want to do a lot of thinking, just wanting to have told a simple story. The Canadian landscape was breathtaking. The beautiful autumn shots alone made the picture worth seeing.
