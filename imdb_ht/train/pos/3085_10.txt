I watched the episodes without online and I was so sad that the show would not be back. He has the best cast of maturity, talented actors and an amazing chemistry. It seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life. Towards the end of the show became engaged, sexy and very watchful. Of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so so ... The characters are all containers and roots for them. The show reminds me a cross between 2 other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Big Kudo all at the disposal. Note for ABC execs: Nielsen evaluation report does not show you the true result. The show audience will mainly record it. I was very disappointed with our large-scale flood-to-television networks or show oriented youth. Why can you find a mature, thoughtful, well-behaved subject to change in HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the online episodes. New media streams will gain greater popularity among the viewers.
