Just mentioned one more thing about Jim's. I agree with all the assessments that make this the biggest Errol Flynn's upgrade in a career in great outing. I would think Jim Corbett's boxer plays more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he had typecast as. Flynn seemed like a party to his memory, and one guy with real life was more interesting than his life screens. Additional things I wanted to point out are the great mounting reviews, transitions, and still insist that punctuate the movie. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a collaborator often with Flynn, and Cinematographer South Hickox, the montages were made by an upcoming and coming-up artist named Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel went far back, but was in the right list of credit. She would go to a great career as director of action itself.
