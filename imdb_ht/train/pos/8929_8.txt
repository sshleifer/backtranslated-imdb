First of all, I liked the central idea of ​​locating the 'intruders', others at the brittle head, at various levels - mostly subconscious, but sometimes more algorithm. In fact, intruders are omnipresent of the film: in the Swiss-frontier front where the pretagonist leads to solitary life; to sleep his renewal and nightmares; inside his body sick after heart transplantation .... In the last half of the film, he gets hackers head, returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of expending for the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is bitter rather than sad, full of regret and guilts, the essence of their failure was more or less dominant. This is a very good picture of an old age, officially independent, but horrifically canceled and solitary inside. Directer's composite images are more transmitted than sensations of anxiety and desires than any explicit meaning. Some of them are fascinating, not devoid of humor though, absurdist types of play only somnambulist can be visualized.
