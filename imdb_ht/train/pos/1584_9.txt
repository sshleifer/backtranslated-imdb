In Rosenstrasse, Margarethe von Trotta mixes two stories to create a vibrant carpet of love and courage. The film portrayed a family drama in strangery between a mother and her daughter, and the story of German women who held a protest on Rosenstrasse liberating the Jewish men from certain exterminations. In addition to dramatizing historical events, the film's focus is on saving a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's lost mother's experience. During Ms. by Trotta shows that the courage of a small German number made a difference, he did not use it in German society's excuses. Indeed, it shows how among torture and extermination, the rich and intellectual artists of German secondary society have gone on over their lives and parties, the subconscious suffering. Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) decides to sit on Shiva, a seven-day period of distress that takes place after a funeral in which Jewish relatives devote the full attention of remembering and the death of the deceased. When Hannah, her daughter (Maria Schrader), calls for a telephone call from Luis Fiyas (Fedja van Huet), a non-Jew, questions Hannah why her mother suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she had already rejected . When Ruth refused her cousin, Hannah asked her questions and learned about a woman named Lena who took Ruth to a child when her mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis, and she promised to get Lena and discovering her mother's secretion and asking her in Berlin where she finds Lena (Doris Schade), now ninety years old, and interviewing her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. Lena tells her story about how a 33-year-old girl (Katja Reimann), she was searched for her husband, Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer (Martin Feifel), who disappeared and was supposed to be imprisoned in spite of protection in virtually the Jewish mixed marriage. Lena, in a radiant performance by Reimann, discovered that her husband and other Jews were kept in prison in an ancient factory on the Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Give us our husbands." Lena finds Ruth (Svea Lohde), a young mother who is in the building. He cared for him, protecting him from the Gestapo and raising him after his mother died. Lena from a German aristocratic family and his brother, recently returned from Stalingrad, is a Wehrmacht officer. After being denied help from his father free Fabian he encouraged the help of his brother saying a fellow officer, "I know what they do in the Jews I've seen it." Giving her support, she is enough dark bypass channels and goes to the top where her beauty and charm proves unstoppable for the Minister of Culture, Joseph Goebbels, a known womanizer. While criticizing this fictional part of the film as degrading protesting women, it is a historical fact that Goebbels was very active in making decisions affecting Rosenstrasse. Director of Margarethe von Trotta, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, is not foreign to political drama. He has led a film about socialism Rosa Luxembourg and Marianne and Julianne, a story in the relationship between two sisters, one of those political violence resorts to accomplish its liberal goals. In Rosenstrasse, a movie he worked for for eight years, he had to make compromises, adding the fictional element to the order he has produced. That she works well is a tribute to Madame von Trotta's artwork and the beautiful scenario by Pamela Katz father who has a refugee in Leipzig. The events in Rosenstrasse lie to the Germans, saying, "There was nothing we could do". Now, Trotta has shown the opposite to be true, that something can be done to resist the Nazis. It is tragic that the example did not catch on.
