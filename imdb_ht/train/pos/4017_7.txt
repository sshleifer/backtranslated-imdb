This is a very memorable Western spaghetti. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. His role as the evil villainess of this movie is truly classic. She stole her every scene, and expressed a lot with her face and eyes, even when she did not speak. Performance is very credible. He managed to be quite fascinating without being on the head (not having anything wrong with being on the head). Mark Damon is amazingly good at this movie too. <br /> <br /> Note in music is excellent, and the theme song is the type that will play in your mind constantly for days after seeing the movie, if you want it or not. There are a couple of very fun parts. I especially love the party where Rosalba Neri strips off the parrot. There are also lots of slick-gun games that are very well done. <br /> I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was not for these two things. First, a funny comic chamber carpet came about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I've ever seen in a movie. It's very wrong choreography, and looks more like a dancing number out of a bad music than any kind of a real battle. One might neglect this if he was a comedy Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but this is a more serious west, and the brawl really needs to be more realistic. Other things that annoy me on this film have been lamenting the Mexican sidekick Yuma. I guess it was supposed to be a funny rescue or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and it was not at all funny. All I can say is where Tuco when you need it? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, let me make sure everyone read that Johnny Yuma is a classic Western spaget despite the fact that I mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.
