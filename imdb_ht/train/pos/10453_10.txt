While traveling by train to Europe, the Jesse Americans (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet with each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. In the morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America, and Celine in Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite romance, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It's a low budget film and a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are stunning. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just completed my 1,000th review number in IMDb, and I chose "Before Sunrise" for this significant meaning because it is a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated Oscar, and such a beautiful scenario, direction and performance. Yesterday I was probably watching this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes Make Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
