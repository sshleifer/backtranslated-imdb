Did you hear the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, you have? Was it put in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above the clouds, and did the heroes make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey? Is equilibrium and sales in the big jacket city on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> I stumble on this movie by accident and I'm really happy that I did! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Much like Pixar movie, it is a piece of computer animated art that might only be possible in today's world. The animators have invested thought of almost everything that appears on the screen, and attention to detail is staggering (the scene where the mushrooms of the green green smoke smoke also carelessly walk in the background is one of my favorites) . Monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to look into action. Though the plot can not be totally unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. Our accompagnateurs are likable and interesting, to ensure that the audience is behind almost impossible to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that might otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the most character that will fall in love with. A small blue animal with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mix of nonsense and English, Hector provided comedy relief in a way Jar Jar Binks could only dream of it. In summary, I would recommend watching the Dragon Hunters if you get the opportunity. Watch it for the incredible animation, the breath-taking battle scene and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike any other thing you've seen on a movie or TV screen. At the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, I)!
