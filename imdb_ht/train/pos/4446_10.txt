Yes, I call this a perfect movie. Not a single boring second, a fantastic cast of little known actors and actors, a great array of characters that are well-defined and all have motifs understanding I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, black and white photography circles, a band tight, an intelligent and harmonious design and a history of engaging and work. It's one of the first quality pictures on which Hollywood's pride would be rested, every marker should try to find. Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing that this actress could not do, and she always goes easy on the melodramatic side. There is no hysterical crisis with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddess like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirms my opinion. Still as tough as nails and at the same time convey true feelings. It is fair to add that he also has many good parties during his long career, and this one is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits this movie very well. It's about the desire, desires of people I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be mourning in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that this is more often than not leading to complications made for the dramatic content where I will not go here. <br /> I like what the movie said about young people, letters and the uncompromising need. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's shadow of a doubt, creating a similar atmosphere of idealizing and at the same time caricaturing the small town of America. The story has a certain similarity with Clash's remarkably tougher movie at night Fritz Lang's night, made a year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar fashion. I can also recommend.
