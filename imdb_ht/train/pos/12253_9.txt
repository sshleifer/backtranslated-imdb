This has long been one of my favorite adaptations in a Austen novel. Although it is definitely not the same as the spectacular "pride and prejudice," "Emma" is a lush and relatively feminine TV show in Austen's novel - especially considering its short lengths. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good, as is the necessary snobbishness that displays Austen at the end of the story to remove here and replace with someone more akin to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought that the characters chose to show their role well-chosen. Kate Beckinsale is walking fine lines between girlishness and social snobbies and a completely lost favor of the Gwyneth Paltrow '96 version. Samantha Morton's wispy weapon wields his attitudes and characters as the simphe who accompanies his role in pre-replacement features with the Harriet we know in the book. Mister Knightly's role is carried out very well in my opinion; Both the gravity and the gentle compassion that the hero painted and in the novel are present here in this very-neglected film, rich.
