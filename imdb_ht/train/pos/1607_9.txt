As another person has already said here, every scene in this movie is gem. Most films are likely to have one scene that is perfect, but the director of Jewison hits a home run every time. The cast received just the right to take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical setting in the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. Difficult to imagine how to maintain the exact mood will be throughout the long-standing production of a movie. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-mirrors mirrors each little emotional infraction into the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (who I know especially in his Frank Lorenzo role on All of the Family until I see him in this and then Off-Broadway in the 80's) deserves far Larger stellar that he ever received, with the hapless deflector Aiello are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving this tremendous cast kudos. Did Jewison ever write about this movie? <br /> I would like to read it. Difficult to figure out why the average rating here at IMDB is so low.
