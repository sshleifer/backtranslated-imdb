The Last Commandment (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg.It shows us Czarist General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his day of glory. In 1917 he was full of power but After the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia it has nothing. He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent) .Around ten years later she applied for a small part of a movie about the revolution. Adult Enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as an extra movie or not. The last commission is pretty good drama silence.Emil Jannings performs memorable role in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful to play lead to women.William Powell is great as always.There are many of the scenes to remember in this movie. Like Stage many with Jannings and Brent.And then have the finish with Powell and Jannings. This is a movie that touches in many parts.
