Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate her unique charisma in this film. This is typical "alternative" or independent film with a plot that features a rare situation suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy with an old camera and its main pleasure is to take pictures of the exotic habits of the small town where he lives Suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to work and his staff in order to expose his work to some important festivals and more. But pecker's life shifted dramatically as now fortunes and fame seem to upset people in the city that is Pecker's main inspiration. Even her sexy girlfriend gets mad because now she does not pay attention to her "adequate". Well this is an Indie movie with a corner, but not for everyone. It may seem sweet or pretentious to some people but I still think it's worth a look only because it offers something "different" than typical Hollywood's typical. To describe in some words: This is Christina's typical Ricci and John Waters movie. That's it. <br /> Oh and I almost forgot to mention that "full of Grace" lines are really annoying. Geez.
