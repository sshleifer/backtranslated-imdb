Another comment on this movie has made it sound disgusting. Since talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and cool. He had not yet found his own style that we had grown up to expect. But it is great to see him this way - always learning the craft. <br /> So many great guys came from this film and it looks, this movie blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is to see it and remember how young this film was. Keep and open yourself and maybe shocked by how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we saw the party early in the last century as uptight .. I love it and hope you do self self on it is not influenced by other negative and a comment note.
