One of the finest music is made, one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again. Good taste! Acting, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. The costumes are exquisite .... even the rag. <br /> <br /> Two young men who play Oliver with the artful cake are beautiful talent. Oliver Reed does a great job showing Bill Sykes where you can not help but hope he comes to a horrible end .... that he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is cleverly choreographer and it is mesmerizing. Oliver can keep her own and love at My Fair Lady, the Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
