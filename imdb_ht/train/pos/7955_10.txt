This is one of the largest movie-makers ever created. I cry every time I see shadow crying "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car pulls away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best Movie Ever! The film sometimes is stupid. As Sassy says luck; "Rule the cat and dog drool!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I liked this line. The scenario may look like some, but I love it. Shadow as the older dog is in preparing the chances to take over for him when he goes is really moving when you think about it. He reminds me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece at the top of "Homeward Bound."
