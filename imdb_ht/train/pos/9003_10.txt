I think that is not the best movie ever to do but I voted it to 10 stars all the same. Mostly because I feel at the end. I and everyone around me were simply touched. This is something you do not often feel. We're all getting a bit cynical and eating up with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the movie center around Jane a young woman in the stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown. This could easily be a dull and despicable piece but it is so humorous, humane and lack of sentimentality that he has you on completely and against the odds is a good movie feel. <br /> The act of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb especially the letter that is always credible and strong in his role. The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards chief, an aircraft made of junk and his old paintings. Fly here is a symbol of both Richards and Janes living the full life so that one can carry on and the other can face the end. <br /> A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend for anyone. Do not let the subject put you off.
