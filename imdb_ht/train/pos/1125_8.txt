Michael Cacoyannis has been a relatively long career, but it was amazing some name credits, including some real dudes such as unaffiliate cold saturated in the day's day the fish came out. Iphigenia, however, is a record. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the Euripides play, it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States Channel Flix's courtesy. The film is shot on an epic scale, but not a big 'movie', with the emphasis placed on the simple story: in the supremacy of the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is obliged to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia ( Tatiana Papamoschou), much of the chaos of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding, but it's the stunning Papamoschou that brings the elements the most interesting screen, combining the innocence of childhood and realization of the dawn that it is planning to play in a political game. Recommended for fans of international cinemas.
