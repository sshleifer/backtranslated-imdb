This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the more infrequent films out of the collection. <br /> It took me a long time to finally get up and found my hand on a copy of this notorious film of films. I bought the pig guinea pig and decided to look at the collection in order not to give up. So I dropped this peanut, and sat down. <br /> In what I read on the Internet, and to realize the content involved in this movie, I was hoping to test my nerves in full force. This was not the case. The movie focuses on a group of people who kidnap a woman and begins to torture her with the hopes of discovering the human point breaking, and how long a person can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> sounds like a right right right? Move. The film failed for shock. This may be because I have become desensitized over the years of my obsession with horror, but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound can sit in this with ease. <br /> On the other hand those who do not have a good knowledge of this type of movie will most likely be submerged and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Even if it fails to hit my movie 's shock there are some nice mean spirits and graphic arts scene. Including chips from nails, triple thrown into a woman unconscious, with a needle in the eye. <br /> <br /> Overall I think for the majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this movie for the gift of it, but I suggest that for any new corner of the types of films that you should work your way up to this one.
