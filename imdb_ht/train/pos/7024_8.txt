I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who was working on it, so I thought I would check it out. I thought it was a really nice movie and cant wait to go and watch it again. The actors were really good and I loved the music! There was not much to talk about in the movie, which at first felt a little strange- but once I was in it, I thought that the story and the act was really emotional and meaningful and thought he had left a lot of imagination. I want to see the movie again because there was a lot about it in that I forgot a lot of little things, but knowing that I left the theater thinking about the movie. It was beautifully shot and everything was really unique.
