This is 2009 and this way disguise has lost anything to the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a variety of beautiful ages of different characters and stories without appearing cluttering. <br /> <br /> Clothing and music could change over time, but in the end this is a story that never lost it up-to-dance. And especially this movie does the job very well. Of course it is lubricated at times, but many touch too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's performance is striking, and it shows that she is really a natural actress who has shown her true potential especially in her earlier movies. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
