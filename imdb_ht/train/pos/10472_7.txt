Anyone who loves the Rheostatics music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, especially on the rhythm and casting of certain actors (by Maury) who are not really compelling in their role, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or plans to watch this movie as featuring CBC TVs in Canada: the streamed version of the CBC is like the Reader's Digestive version of WHALE music --- do not watch it . It cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can) from the movie. The CBC, which featured most of untouched films, took half the bowels from whale to music. I do not know why. It's terrible that they made the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but DO NOT watch it on CBC TV.
