Luckily, knowing nothing about this movie I was curious enough to tape it out of TV. Then the tape runs out just five minutes before the finish! <br /> But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great movie movie. There are the usual submarines game with a bit of curve in bathing, but also very refreshing and even daring times. Considering the production of 1969, certain slight lesions have to be raised to some eyebrows. Of course now it does not surprise anyone and the scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of George's actress. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, not surprising, and it certainly struck me. Very effective. Also their views from both sides of their opponents give the entire story more depths along the usual suspicion and action. This is not just a heroic heroic story of one side victorious, but shows what lies behind the victory of good and bad. Well, being a case of war, especially bad. <br /> <br /> For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never on the head. And I think I have to try to catch more cinema and Suzy Kendall. Talk about Miss! Let's hope to find this on DVD soon, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this little little known.
