If movies should believe, Chinese ghosts are much smarter and more malignant than Western counterparts. The chronicles of the three Chinese films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and color is such that it's not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of embrace. For those who do not meet the GhostStory Chinese trilogy again, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror genre / ghost; for those who have, another enjoyable movie in the Chinese ghost world.
