One of Vance's best films succeeds more on exciting plots and rogue than none other than Michael Curtiz. This time around a generally hated financier found dead - shot at the top - in locked room and bolted it on the upper floor. Philo Vance, heard of the situation while on the set for Italy, decided to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murderer and what everyone else is considering a suicide. William Powell is as boon a Vance Philo as you will find. It never seems to press and is still very listening to what he says and does. Powell is assisted by a very talented actor - some actor first-rate actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hates his uncle Ralph Morgan as the dead man's secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog rattle, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the next blonde holder, and two really good performances by James Lee as the Chinese cooking and portly Eugene palette as a wise-cracked police detective. Adding to the mix a beautiful comedy turn by Etienne Girardot as a public chronicle still misses his food. It is this depth of suspicion and a tale of many twists and turns that the cannon's canon can be a quick, moving, fun mystery.
