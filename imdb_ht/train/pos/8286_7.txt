Larry Fessenden has been invaded by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake, obviously, is the marketing of the movie and how the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for those who are waiting for anything that will gory and immediately satisfy. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be said to yourself in young miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in the young minds and ultimately dominate the fears and the ominous world they can not understand. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she does not have any clues to what's going on in her mind. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, which seems to live in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles' fears came to a point in crisis over the weekend in the country. This part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, trees can breed, play havoc on the boy's imagination. It does not help that he encountered an unusual figure in town, creating even more doubt in his youth spirit. Ultimately, the moon's moon comes crashing down on it and can not do anything, even conveying the Spirit Wendigo. The film is well-trained and acting. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where her film is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the far father with an opportunity to get closer to a child she does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, transmits the interior turmoil to him. I thought it was very effective since the whole movie is Miles possessing what's going on around her. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the ominous Otis, a man who hates the world for its way back. <br /> Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
