I watched a bunch of episodes in Cold Case since its prime minister (especially now that he immediately followed the amazing race, but this was one of the best cases of writing and act I saw in the house of Bruckheimer The casting, especially of the smaller officers, was spot on, with the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the act made this episode a trip d 'force.If I was the producers I would submit this Episode for Consideration of Emmy. It's amazing how to complete a portrait made in Coop and Jimmy at the limit of 48 minute episodes; which takes a lot of talented people to do their best. I hope there are in advance warning Episode repeat, because I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I did not notice the first time around.
