"Girl Party" capitalized on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the film seems to be a car that Ms. Posey allows to play itself, as it normally is in real life. The movie, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Mrs. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us to a wild trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this steam soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the different clubs it is still frequent. This is a more naive era than that area with adjacent District Meat Market has become. At least, there is no pretense of these films and we see down the world of people going on their lives in a normal way, if we can call it so. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey does an amazing Mary. Because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie much more than if another actress would play Mary. It is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
