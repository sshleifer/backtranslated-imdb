As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific guy. Hes made hundreds of hundreds of films, many of them crap. However, it manages to sneak into a work periodically quality among all OS-based OS. "Succubus" is not his best work (this is either the "Dr. Z Zero" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many of its brands that make it a must for anyone interested in diving in its large catalog. them. It combines the erotic (alternate between showing full-naked front and leaving somethings leaving the imagination) and the surreal of transparency. This is a very dreamy movie, filled with great atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant constant. Despite coming out as being extremely firefighter, it's fun to hear Franco's influence. <br /> Still, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they are coming from. It's leisurely rhythm, but I can deal with that. More problems are the incoherency. The script here was obviously running, and within five minutes of the movie I was absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really assembled from this point). People who want some subtle substances look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never really gets scary or even suspense. Still, I was entertained by all the psychiatric stupid that I did not really mind these major deeds all too much. (7/10)
