The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough. <br /> <br /> Jury Machacek (Standa) plays a guy, dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. When trying to get financially reimbursed by his evil, ex-boss, the situation gets out of control. While Standa is really (but endearingly) stupid, Her friendship humble is an absolute blithering idiot that bugles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa could stand a chance to go to life with some modest degrees of success. And unwillingly, life will never be boring, but it sure will not be without much headache! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, a kind of evil genius that has degenerated into some Hitler-esquire delusional tyranny. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek safe safe. <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of the Czech film. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produced more than its superb entertainment party. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you've seen the absolute best of Czech movies.
