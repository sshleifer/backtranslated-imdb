I actually love the original, and this movie has its UPS and Downs. Here's just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original voice throw back. <br /> Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's Maon. I know he has made a voice in the Simpsons, but this is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> OPS: We get to see Simba as a "teenager." <br /> Downs: They wasted it with a slug-ant between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." <br /> <br /> Downs: How Pumbaa to get on it? <br /> <br /> Ups: Sing again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just music backgrounds.) <br /> Downs: Stupid songs. (solo a.k.a solo). <br /> Overall, this is a very good movie. I would recommend it to fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, the odds you will not like this one. <br /> I score: 7/10
