Action. Comedy. Stop. This movie has it all. The draw goes that 4 would be robbed professionals are invited to participate in an heist of a small town in Montana. Each type of character archetypal character is here. Frank, the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <master. Carlos, expert of weapons. Max, the expert explosive. Nick, the cracker is safe with Ray, the machine man. Unfortunately for Frank, he was arrested by 2 bumbling detectives (described very well by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who chased him from New Jersey writing after he sent out the letters to the other 4. <br / > <br /> 4 characters we meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them love or trust each other. Added to the mix is ​​the fact that Frank goes, and they do not know why they are called together. <br /> Now Frank is being taken back to New Jersey by the detective 2 but quickly rescued and try to make his way back to the guys who have all sorts of problems in their own. <br /> Surely a big movie is packed with laughter and great act. Just a good movie movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
