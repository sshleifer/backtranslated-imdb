WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live in Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> Kane vs MVP at an Inferno Match: So this is the fourth ever Inferno to match at the WWE and it's Kane vs MVP (wonder why he first match on the map). I only see the end parties where Kane sets MVP's ass on fire as they're on the cabin and then MVP is running around the arena while calling? eventually refs to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as MVP sprawls around the entry ramp. Funny and visually quite fun to finish. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Tournament: This was originally to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) at a regular tag team tag. However, GM Teddy Long arrives in the ring and announces that he will make a fatal 4-star star star ladder team. MNM and Hardys are thrown in with it in all mess. A word to describe this eye-box? wow. Man, I really can not remember how many diseased spots had in this word match can not really do it justice. There was one particularly notable place where Hardys set up a ladder in a saw-saw position and Jeff jumped on the top rope while Matt kept MNM for the kill, and then WHAM! Nitro hauled as Mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell and lazerations on her face. He had to take away and Nitro continue the match alone. Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while he flip on the ladder. There were other great-flying splendid spots too many to remember. London finally unbuckles the belts to win this show-stealer. 8.2 / 10 <br /> Boogeyman vs. Miz: Two guys get thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman exploded a sit-out powerbomb for the victory and then with glass drools on the Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for incognito three minutes. <br /> <br /> United States Championship: Chris Benoit (c) is facing Chavo Guerrero again another typical match of Guerrero. Some good spots include a superplex off the head by Chavo and a very long chain of German trunk by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the Benoit nail belt but Benoit's crisis cut off and takes a long time deciding whether to put it into a buteur or not. This allows Chavo to go for a roll-up but Benoit rolls up once more and Chavo is close to the Sharpshooter. Game over. Good hard-fighting fights albeit slowly at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Tournament: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this one, in a fairly moderate-rhythm match. The match has some high-flying spots ?? most notably eliminating 'movement off the top rope ?? but the crowd did not seem to be in it after witnessing the ladder match, and Yang needs to get more airborne. Helms won the match after blowing Yang off with a facebuster on the knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> The Andertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Final Ride Match: Following a series of matches between the two, this time it is a match with the latest Ride, the second all the time in its kind and Winner has escorted his opponent from the arena to a chef. Pretty good indeed for what two could offer. Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke free from a Chokeslam to throw Taker into the Armageddon to set about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost won the win until Taker got back inside the audience (I liked the camera look inside the audience). Taker then missed a steel pipe pipeline over Kennedy and broke the hearing window in instead, but then later Kennedy busted open with a chair, and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the roof heard. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I actually found myself really interested in these guys' willingness to take real ill vaccine. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa comes to the ring, I go "what the hell?" like many of the children in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" comes into my ears. Time to break. <br /> <br /> Batista & Jan Cena vs Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma vs techniques. This match was actually a good main event and momentum of rational moving from one team to the other and holding good suspension. Even Finlay had some legitimate good shots about his opponent this time (I kind of doubted his strength against the champs), and he and mainly booker did not succeed in trying to cheat ?? except at a point where Booker rammed his scepter at the Cena's gloom. Batista hit the bomber for the win, did not get to see the F-U; The Cena made the 5 knuckle shuffle anyhow and I think he also made the STFU. This was probably the best match technique of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a 7.5 / 10 ladder. <br /> <br /> When an over-the- off fans, I have to agree Armageddon has stretched out a lot of eye catchers at all, and the match ladder finally swallows half of the show; The last ride ride featured some nerve-wrenching spots, and the main event was also done very well for its category. All other matches also lived up to the bills except maybe Boogeyman against the Miz and the ever-useless lingerie contest. Usually Armageddon was a very affordable pay-per-view and despite some major conflicts in the early XV chronology, Armageddon wants to honor this year respectable. PPV Rating: 8/10.
