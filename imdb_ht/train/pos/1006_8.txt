The Roman novelist Roman A. Heinlein was looted around and in recent years, in everything in the 1997 Paul Verhoeven film in a series of TVs, in a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually related, the TV series was more of a cut off, and the less told about Verhoeven's movie, the best. Little to do more, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation was already made, released the year to Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, drawn-wise, Heinlein's most loyal adaptation. <br /> <br /> The most obvious in this series is the presence of the exoskeletons of power, something we have prevented from Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships over action and space travel, even though we see a fair amount of each. While events occur differently than in the book, the feeling of conspiracy of the book is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entertainment, but it's only a little more touching than passing through the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction should be somewhat inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the animated treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political ideas are merely enticing, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The huge settlement of the series, however, is the climatic battle over Klendathu between the troops and the bugs / aliens, which features the kind of action from the gun weapons costume we would like to have seen in a movie version. > <br /> In general, I liked this series because I wanted to see a closer look at Heinlein. And I think they did very well with that. If you can get this series, give it a look.
