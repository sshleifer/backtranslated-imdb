The novel is easy to superior and the best part of the film is the direct translation of what Greene wrote; for example the quiet but smelly smell that breaks through the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the murdered-off mania that takes on some of the plot. Where the movie diverted to the novel, it tends to make the comic. <br /> However I do not want to suggest that the movie is bad in any way. It always looks like the party and the story remains in your mind as a good 'un. Some of the minor characters were stock actors who would turn their hands into anything. <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
