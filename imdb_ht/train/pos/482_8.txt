This is a poem about film, beautifully presented with photos and artistic tender. It captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (Italy's Lake District in the Twenties.) It's a love story with a twist. Characters are unique and credible. The environments are delightfully exotic. Some of the scenes - the funeral fun of the fog --- high long shot of the lady board in the center of a complex mosaic - are beautiful images. And rather than completing the required binding, this story has a sweet bitternally sweet. If film is an artist, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
