CURRICULA PRESSURE. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best of it. Well, so goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for clothes was funny. This guy was good, too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. Of these should have been a lot more time on the screens together. They are chemistry great. The WOW! Amoure, sweet, yummy. <br /> <br /> Is it a thirsty waitress who rescued an alien and ends up in the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to greed of politicians. To talk about Sarandon should be very far away. SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic / comedy comedy, and it meets both a bit-side politics a whole lot more than the romantic. It touches on political issues, and just barely skims on romantic zones. <br /> <br />
