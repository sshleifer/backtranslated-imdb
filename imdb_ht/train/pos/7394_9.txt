This Chinese movie has made me feel very similar and members of a culture I do not belong and far away. In an almost Buddhist approach, the movie helps one to relate to each character, and the happiness of doing simple things routine. <br /> <br /> All the actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu excels goodness and wisdom, yet also vulnerable and mean. Er Min's brother delayed, showing us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes from the most disparate people of this universe. A different China, this is far from the Chinese's realistic, yet, it has many humanity and realism in a different kind. <br /> <br /> Find it. You will not be disappointed.
