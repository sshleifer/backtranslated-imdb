Before Tuscan Sky, I saw Diane Lane's sensitive performance in this bark otherwise in a movie. Campaigns are invited to the youth camp and experience it as adults. Each of these returns seems to be looking for something to lose, making it so realistic. Perhaps you had a really camper to find it, but in the words of a character noticed all of its clothes were wet "this is so camp!" From the practice jokes and fighting on boyfriends, at the lunchtime lunch ladies and early morning slamming ... it's amp. Once exciting activities look like mundane. A terrific ensemble joints make the best of one-dimensional roles and make them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Ms. Brad Paisley (probably when she first dropped for it !!) The beautiful scenery, bright colors, funny music (including variations in Hello Muddah) and a funny acting act have not been noted by director Sam Raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like raising an old friend.
