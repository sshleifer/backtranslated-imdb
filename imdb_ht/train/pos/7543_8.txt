This is a visual adaptation of manga and many dialogues. what dialogue has to appear in word baloons as it would be in the manga. This scheme is existing but only vaguely accounted for. There is a problem in the manga on which this site is available in English in the explosive book collection, 'Funny underground Japan', and has current captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here. I recommend checking this volume if you liked this, as it explains some of the "plot" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. This wise animation is very decent, good wireless use of computers and images is for the most accomplished part. It jumps in and out of episodes, like the characters, a cat and brain-dead older cat cat up in and out of a series of odd images: a boat, a circus, a desert. For a half hour only to go through a number of semi-cemeteries and surroundings, leading me to believe that the director chose a number of issues in the long run manga adapted at random, but primarilly chose visually. knowing what's going on might eventually increase appreciation. This reminds me mostly of what kind of stuff used to play on the mtv show, sushi cartoon, in particular a short feature of a cat chasing someone to cut the butt-weight of the house. Only in this case the cats are similar to hello kitty plus and the expanding adventures include death and reincarnation and a number of other terms [though not all that easy to tell what's going on]. The DVD of this was the director with a "do" feature, but I cant comment on these because I do not get around them. I give this an 8/10 for now, here is not much to compare it's hosted, and I hope for more like this.
