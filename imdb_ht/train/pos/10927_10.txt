This is one of my favorite Koun-Fu films and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers from the late 70's. The plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - frog, snake, lizard etc. The action is limited in comparison to other films Chang Cheh / Venoms but what's interesting with different kung-fu styles on shows of the various characters. I recommend this movie to those who think that all films are films especially Chang Cheh films are the same, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tiger and Shaolin against manchu conflict. This movie is the fresh air in comparison.
