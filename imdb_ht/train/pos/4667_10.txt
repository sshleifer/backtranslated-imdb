Recently I found this movie on VHS after looking for it for a number of years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and co-wrote the original scenario (nominated for awards Academy). Other stars you've included Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, just released from Trinit√© scam the England Worm Scrubs (he was degraded from the Conservative Party headquarters, choosing because he's a liberal). It immediately starts a search for a new employer from whom it can embezzle, and discover that the computers are vague in the future. He's social road engineer at London's club and learns the best computer expert in town and steals the identity of one Seza Smith, who has just left town for South America to pursue his pleasure in Collect butterflies in the wild. He spoke on his way to Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate directed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper employs Smith and shows him at computer center, especially its security features including a flashing light blue. Ustinov asked the computer how to defeat his security and the computer required to say, him, "Disconnect light blue." Using hacking techniques from 30 years of the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and computer programs to generate written checks from various bogus companies. The scheme starts to fumble when Assistant Klemper to Governor G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) noted the amount of business Ta-Can-Co appears to be Ustinov's transactions and insurances companies. With the help of secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov managed to avoid prosecution and life happily ever after. To tell you how to rob this very funny, romantic, smart, and front-of-it-time photo.
