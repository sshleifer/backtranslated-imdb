Except for an awesome scene, fantasy crap story has a fun and delightful undercurrent of understanding cynical adults who charms its way to the audience as well as a powerful band that leaves this season together. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that does not come across lists and appearing from the sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this appetizing romantic fairy has a great storytelling and the strong magic and balance of fine between Severe stage adventure with the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the tradition of updating of the PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is fascinating. Eight out of ten stars.
