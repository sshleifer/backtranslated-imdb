I liked this show so much and I'm so incredibly sad to cancel it I thought it was back too, but just two weeks stupid. This is terrible. I hate how we never find out how everyone has finished. it absorbs. Bring it back! ABC has stupid show like Supernanny and whatever but does not give the good times as six degrees. If they are complaining about the evaluation it was probably because they had a bad place because this was really a good show, something I could relate to and anticipate. JJ Abrams was rescued, fearing, I wish ABC could just trust him enough to complete the story. I liked to throw at all too. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet one day at one time. Everyone's story is now left incomplete, now I will never know if Steven and Whitney would get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really like a downe.
