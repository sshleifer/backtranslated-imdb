The Italian is an amazing movie for its time. Astonishing shotgun, with the really sublime lighting effect, this is an early GEM reveal REGINALD BARKER to be a pioneer director of equal standing D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince exercises on production is difficult to know, but this movie still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant who struggles to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The terms of injustice injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely important today. Using closed-ups is exceptional and powerful powerhouse GEORGE BEBAN ELECTRICAL. What we need now is a really good copy of DVD transfer so we can really appreciate this early prince in movies.
