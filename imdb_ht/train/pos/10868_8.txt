I always think this would be a long and boring talk-head flicker full-faced interior film taken, dude, I was wrong. "Election" is a very captivating and captivating thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view of the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer as they still remain an outsider, it is still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and the ambition of their characters. In addition, Johnnie has succeeded in creating some really opulent images due to meticulous lighting and atmospheric lighting-shaded contrast. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking at it without mercy described by brutality. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came as the guitar acoustic guitar score quite a bit.
