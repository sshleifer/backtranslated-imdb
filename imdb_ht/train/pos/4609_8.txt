Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, with the one who put it on the card. This self-directed police drama is evident in the opening and closing scenes, during which the squatters' and commercial malls are demolished. There are, clearly, differences between Chinese and armed versions, and many of the jokes that make their way to the letter. The latter is also hampered by stars that sounds nothing like the original Chinese. In fact, the only thing the duplication was corrected is the trial court ?? At the time, Hong Kong colonial trials were conducted in English, while the original has this scene of cantons! However, Chan's style battles and choreography in martial arts implements humor where possible, so non-cantonal audiences do not miss much. It's not, after all, the dialogue that makes a flashlight, but the action and the painful out-take. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays a detective detective Hong Kong pursuing a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between. It will never make you think, but what a fun, and quite nervous-together, movie. Fortunately, this is one of the best martial arts films.
