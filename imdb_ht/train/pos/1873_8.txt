Violent and rebellious twenty-five-year-old Marine Fisher (Derek Luke) sent three sessions for psychiatric evaluation to Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another explosion and aggression against a marine superior ranking. Reluctant from the beginning of treatment, she becomes the trust of Dr. Davenport and releases her childhood, revealing painful traumas produced in his foster home. Meanwhile, she meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant), and they fall in love for each other. Solve her personal problems, Become a new person. This true family drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life. Direction Denzel Washington is excellent, sensitive, attractive and delicious, a story about child abuse. From another director, it might be a very heavy story. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Return to Live')
