Orson Welles "Lady From Shanghai" does not have a brilliant storyline of "Citizens Kane," for example, but Charles Lawton, Jr. The pieces are unforgettable (such as the scene of the aquarium, the sea scene featuring a stunning, blonde-treated Rita Hayworth song "Please Do not Love Me," and the Hall is really amazing in mirrors climax), and cast In Wonderland (Everett Sloane's greatest performance, Welles in a very well-under-played role, before-mentioned Miss Hayworth - Welles' wife at the moment - at her most gorgeous) makes for a memorable memory experience. The mystery plot kills mystery is fun and compelling, not inscrutable at all. The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and Welles' closing line is a classic unheralded. "Lady from Shanghai" gets four stars in this fair discussion.
