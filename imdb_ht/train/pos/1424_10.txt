Instead, it is wrong that review keeps comparing this planet Earth ... In the * course * Planet Earth is better - it has many more of the same. Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it does not compare with love. <br /> <br /> As a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature-nothing length), it's pretty much out of sight that you'll see all of your life (unless you choose to cross the Earth's helicopter and long range cameras for years In the end, and wait for months to the most extreme environment to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - allow to face it - is easy). <br /> <br /> On the narration: yes everyone in the UK - many including me - worshiping David Attenborough, and there is little excuse for him not to be told here, but that hardly deserves to hit pi Harder still down a star or three. It was not a presenter on planet Earth, just a narrator, and I am sure he is modest and gracious enough to realize that anything that gets more viewers is good. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its trembling, majesty and glory. All reviews agree. People who love it (ie everyone) will have to go to see a Planet Earth buy. So, three cheers for its cinemas, with a great Boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on DVD rather than the Planet Earth box-set. But as art works are not in competition here people. <br /> <br /> The Earth is big enough for both.
