I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. I was still a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasized it. She shows a housewife in an African-American family moving up the social chain due to the success of the husband (Danny Glover) as an attorney. He moves in a white neighborhood where the people are friendly but slightly left in the direction of it. The various events occurring during the course of the film make for some laugh but mostly appeal to the other emotions. This film is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you get it on TV or rent it soon.
