Not as bad as a movie as I thought it would be. <br /> She had a good cast. She saw Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors. /> Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects.Maybe starting to oppose her sexy cousin Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> Also a good use of existent places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> We hope we will see more UK-European co-production like this.
