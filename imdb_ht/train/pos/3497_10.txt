One of the more brilliant young people who went all out and courageously made a teen romance movie (I can actually call it ... - it would invoke the devil out of his fans) on a budget but charged budget with such taste flavor, maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect.Thank you once again to demonstrate in the powers of the "industry" that stereotypes can float down the toilet. Somewhere, a handful of rich characters, budget budgets, good acting (and so too amateurs), classy decent - worshipers of true indie movies should look more at this and stop watching ... well ... you know what.
