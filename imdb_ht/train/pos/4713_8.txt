One of them, this movie is not perfect. It does not hang down properly as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks hanging jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a little '80s' and tend to date the picture. br> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still refer to comic quotes from it about 2 decades later. <br /> Plus, there are a lot of familiar figures; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne, and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr, Skipper at Island Gilligan. Also, there are some great absurdities, such as Johnny's labeling puppies with a prize gun, or the Pope to make an appearance in the Johnny neighborhood. Also, the scene where the false priest makes up a lot of Latin words is excellent. ("Ever and big, the radio is too loud ... Post Meridian, Meridian Haunted, Meridian Uncle"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney butchering the English Danny Devito asks Griffin Dunne to play 'Ball play' Peter Boyle thinks she loses her manhood The fake VD movie <br /> <br /> This movie There is no home run. But like the 'Porky', it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
