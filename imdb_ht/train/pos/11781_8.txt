The documentary presents an original theory of "Weapons, Microbes and Steel". The series graphically displays several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defending the theory against common criticisms. <br /> I was deeply convinced to find user comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say the documentary presents information taught in middle school. Indeed, it does. In fact, I really loved the original information I've known since middle school and unexpected analysis. <br /> So, if you like to know why things work, if you took apart the phone trying to determine how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how farm works and how The milk cows, you will enjoy this series. A definite recommendation.
