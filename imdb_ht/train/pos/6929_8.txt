See this movie about ENCW last Nite for the third or fourth time. Enjoy it so much I ordered the DVD. This really is an exceptional and of course the first of the Mann-Stewart pairs. More here than the usual oater, although not quite as powerful as looking. Many obvious symbols about achieving manhood but especially her are acting by Stewart, her partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean- Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting as a lovely hero would be interested in Lola but too yellow. Like Stewart of the man who killed Liberty Valance, he was practically reduced to wearing a cabin and serving his enemy's coffee. Decaf no doubt. Tony Curtis from the Bronx Rider and Rock Hudson behave like no Americans I've seen on screen have Enteros came. Special Performance by John McIntire as a lucky dealing / weapon card hanging from a very low west class version of the Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens comes out on a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some pretty scenes with Stewart before he gets bend in the river and far away. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief to Capture Walter Brennan's teeth at Red River are wonderful signs. This is the kind of west that Stewart only, by Wayne and Scott could pull off. Send the shot, I repeat. :-)
