Many reviews here explain the story and character of 'night opening' in some detail so I will not do that. I just want to add my comments that I believe the film is a beautiful affirmation of life. <br /> At the beginning of Myrtle Gordon will remember how 'easy' it was to act when he was 17, when he was young and energy and felt he knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally vulnerable, wondering what her life was for, and indeed, if she could even survive. A tragic accident triggers a persistent crisis that is almost overwhelmed. <br /> Almost - but not quite. In the eleventh hour he rediscover the power of his art and reasserts himself ("I'm going to bury that bastard," she says in Maurice actor parody as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping him when he comes to hopelessly drinking for his first performance. He knows, however, that he has the courage to do it himself if he is doing it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on the bottom of the Myrtle. I believe it is really it 'night opening' - it opens like a flower of new possibilities of life and action, and sees a way forward. It is very much moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.
