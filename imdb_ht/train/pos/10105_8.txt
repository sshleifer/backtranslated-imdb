Led by Govind Nihalani, this film is copied into American cinema. May be the first one to describe the Stark fact of corruption in the police force & policy with no strictly prohibited & how it effects on a young cop. A man was forced to enter a career in a cop by his bark dad. Agreeing that we have grown up watching many good movie cops / bad movies but this is different. Today's generation, growing up watching black & realistic film like 'Satya', 'Company' can consider it inferior to products in comparison, but look at the time of its making. The movie has made absolutely tonal off of the time when people did not pay much attention to these types of movies & yet it became a most sought after film movie in class & mass audience when he released. For Om Puri its first tool in mainstream Hindi movies & it delivers a class performance as Velankar Inspector. It's more than cop character, it enters a lot that is something original in acting. Watch her scene with her father whom she hates & smita whom she loves. Smita Patil kept dignity of his character at the expected level. My God is a natural expression he brought !!! Shafi Inamdar was really a discovery for me & he is a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om. The film is also the first of a vicious verse on the American screen - Sadashiv Amrapurkar as 'Rama Shetty'. It's another story that he did not find such a violet role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud guys in Dharmendra's movie B class. Watch the scene where Om 1 times becomes a rebel for his father (played by Amrish Puri) & Next both to share wine together. How inner truth began to reveal for both the character and confronted feelings of love & hatred for each other. The faces of the American Police force - Miskelite & Impotence and in between manta and half truths (ardh satya) Kudos in touching the Nihalani. The film won 2 National Awards as Best Movie Feature Movie and Best Actors- Om Puri & 3 Filmfare Awards at Best Movie, Best Director & Best Supported Actor Category. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone who is interested in nostalgia in serious Indian movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
