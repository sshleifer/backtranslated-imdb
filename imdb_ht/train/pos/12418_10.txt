This film and its end Barry Mckenzie keeps its own, the two greatest comedies ever to be produced. A great story of an Aussie youth trapped for England to claim his inheritance and meet with his companions, who are just as loving and innocent as he is. <br /> It's shocking a block full of words, where else can you find someone who needs a drink so bad that it is as dry as a dying dead donger? great characters, acting head, and getting big sheilas and more favorable intake then any other three films put together. Top dan. <br /> And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of great celebrities. Definitely from my favorite movie of all time, I watch at least once a fifteen days.
