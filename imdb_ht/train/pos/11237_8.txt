Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running web only movie fan, performing completely for the love of the series, and a must look for fans of trek. The quality of the production is extremely high for a fan movie, although sometimes you can say that they're green-screenin 'it. This does not take away the overall experience however. The CGI boats are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes ... On the negative side, I could say in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally of the new ones) that some of the actors / actresses are not quite Comfortable in their role, but once again, this does not take away the overall experience of the new interpretation of Star Trek. The cast and crew have really come up with something special here and, as a whole, I would highly recommend this series of fans of the next generation and Space Space 9.
