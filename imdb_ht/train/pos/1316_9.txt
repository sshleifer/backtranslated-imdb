I just finished watching this finely conceived, and very well-acting / directed movie. He dived with Tuck as if I was going to wasting my time watching a movie on the movie movie network because of the horribly unsafe commercials. Reading the comments earlier I took myself to give it a shot. After all the worst that might happen would be that I might fall asleep during one of the boring yet long bug spores. So why did I watch it? especially because when IMDB gives a movie a "Great Value" in 5.8 AVAILABLE WHO'S STATISTICS was 7.3 It must be a certain hit. <br /> I was totally happy to have taken the time to see this film, commercial pox and all. Helen Hunt continues to be surprised by her ability to take on the challenging role to adapt to her basic personalities to fit every role. His portraiture was portrayed in this film by police officer who had no interpreter that was very well executed. When the screams call for witted quick, timely release verbal curves, it can stand toes with toes and any actors. But it is adept at the delivery of traders in emotional responses without pronouncing a word relying only on facial expressions and body language. Without advertising, non-designing continuous killing of any good film, this would be a real corner-of-the-seat nail bite. I gave it a 9.0
