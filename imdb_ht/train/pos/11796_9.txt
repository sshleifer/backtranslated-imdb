Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous suicide event in modern times would have been enough to provide this 2-part 1980 make-for-TV movie attention. But the fact is that it is a superb recreation in the life of Rev. The Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire, and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sand cult in which a Congress and its entourage were killed, and 917 followers committed suicide by drinking Kool- aid doused with cyanide. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton, and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powerhe Boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out like Jim Jones. He actually lives the man, and his performance is fixed and refrigerated. Thus, it is not surprising that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
