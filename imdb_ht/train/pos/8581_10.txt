This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All those who consider this film as absolute sh * t obviusly are not smart enough to grasp all subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real-life and "ficticious" actions can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, she has one of the most clever ways for two people to get to each other. My name is another movie where you can see all of this as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're Going To Get Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."
