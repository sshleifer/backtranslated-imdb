Not seeing the movie in the original theater release, I was happily surprised when the DVD arrived, since this movie did not have the wide distribution it deserves. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington debuya first and the finished product has nothing to envy other films about the same theme by the more accomplished director. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned so much that he was on the other side of the camera. It brings a different angle to this movie. <br /> One of the best things the movie has is, without a doubt, the fine performance by Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right direction, will go away, no doubt. Take it on the troubled man, at this point in his life, in turmoil and suffering for a life but bad, up to now, did it, indeed. He is a good portrait of a man of pain that is fundamentally very good and has given so much, but no one seems to see that side of his character. In the worst time of his despair, Failure is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, to a very seriously, if somehow submits. Because of the anger of antwone, she lacks the opportunity to open herself to the man, who wants to help, but because of the restraints placed in his office, just has three sessions and then has dismissed his patients. <br /> <br /> Things to work out, as Admonished is able to persuade the doctor to keep working with him. The past survivor reveals in detail. The abuse she suffered from Mrs. Tate, her foster mother, is brutal, to say at least. The attempt at an older woman in Tate's house in a sexual misconduct, gave him a bitter taste that would remain with her in her adult life, as she was scarred by the shame she was wearing. <br /> <br> antwone finds the latest love with Cheryl, who patient enough to make her see a different world does not like her and her support to her. <br /> <br /> The lead performance are very good indeed. Denzel Washington at Dr. Davenport also has his own problem. It is not a happy campaign either. She can help help, but she can not help herself, or her relationship with a worship wife. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a beautiful Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a fine actress is superb as Ms. Tate, the adoptive mother abused. <br /> <br /> The reunion of anounced with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental, but of course, if one is believed to be Fisher to find happiness at last, one has accepted this part of film in as well.
