Netflix should mention this brief description of the stockings for either Stockings. Superior in any way that buzz over-producing. This was the best Cole Porter song and much more energy. Silk Stockings turned out to be a great disappointment. Fred has become too old for this sort of thing, though the dances and the Cyd are nice. I'll be on the watch for the Garbo version - Melvyn Douglas in Ninotchka. Are Peter Lorre sick while doing in either Stockings - it seems to be very passive in the most active and less line numbers? Very happy that I ran across Paree - Tariff by accident. Has experienced all a lot more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "singing and dancing" is the best quality.
