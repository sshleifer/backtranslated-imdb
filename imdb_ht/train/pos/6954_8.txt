This movie was one of the funniest films I saw in years and laughed at the audience members supporting me. By the time my great Greek wedding (2002) the laugh has been as spontaneous and intense. Easy was complicated as Mr. last year and Mrs. Smith (2005) in her use of parody (espionage of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex at My Super Ex Girlfriend). Riding of Ivan Reitman The director between comedy and drama, between crazy and outright funny is great. Never the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy. At the same time, this romantic comedy predictable never lost touching its emotional elements even if it's finished in the broadcast. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it plays out. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that one can not really see it. Easy eight from ten stars up there and Tootsie (1982). Possibly a nine (depending on how it appears on a second look).
