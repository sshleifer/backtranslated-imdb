One of my favorite films. He had everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, former Motorhead, loads of action, loads of laughter, plotted ridiculously and the most wonderful '80 stereotype as character. Eddie, who puts on the handsome guy, who just wants to stay alone to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), the Nuke (burning-out rock), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy as the publisher (surely it exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, greedy and stupid) and the girls (empty, prosperous and stupid). What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every 80 'badas rocker you can think of. What about rocket rocket shooting? Then there's the scene where Sammi pulls the old lady on the TV screen and breaks her up. And what does Roger do? Why, hoover it up, just like a good geek would. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets over time over time from Sammi via the wet finger of the plug - magic! <br /> <br /> If you've been in the rock '80 or just love ridiculous movie like me then check this out. It is available on DVD and very cheap so (trick or) treat yourself.
