Sure, the story of this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but it's far from being the only bit of rewrite history for the masses. Lafite sided with the Americans because he considers himself a Frenchman and therefore hates the British, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that has taken over New Orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his sailing to Galveston; it was more of a little criminal and weakness than a hero * or * a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is one movie of absolute entertainment - and facing her, we all wanted Jean to go to the festive cries rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. Brynner once again got on mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.
