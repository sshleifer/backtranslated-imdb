This is one of the best movies. It is one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touches. Good camera work too. The names of actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star List. However, they give equal or better performance than the top of the list. It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having endured watching someone who has kick-box roads to save the world. <br /> If you do not like this movie then you have no heart or feeling. Then go to a sports movie. There is no kill or horror here. Watch the movie. It is a must. TH
