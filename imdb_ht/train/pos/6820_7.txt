The film was better than the other declared review. It's a beautiful family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time to the old elevator in her apartment building. Of course, no one believes it is trying to explain his disappearance. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and can help the girl's family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. He reminds me of a Hallmark movie to give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be targeting more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much PG or G rated. I'm an adult who can appreciate a wonderful "family" movie - I guess the other review is not.
