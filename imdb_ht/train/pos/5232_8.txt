This film is a journey to the spirit of a senarist caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the most unfair question of 'Who am I' and 'what are I?' It's a courageous venture and thought. There is a shipload of beautiful, dream-inspired images, Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of drawings from himself, or rather, erase himself. More and more we follow the writer of his agony on what's said and that movie, we see him calling with his wife who left for Peru, leaving him taking care of the babies, doing a job with less and less careful until it is so absorbed in its dilemma that it hardly resembles the child again. Her wife returned and made a scene, destroying her score and helping her get to the last threshold until she deleted her self. Interspersed and eye-pleasing and I-destruction images, the story is mostly philosophical. It is on the veils of Maya, the world of illusion. The film paradox however, is that it needs a lot of talk and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. For more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophy movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie. If that was the goal of the maker, he succeeded well.
