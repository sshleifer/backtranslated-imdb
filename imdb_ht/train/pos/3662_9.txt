This is a really strange movie - and that's NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale. I'm sure some can get this movie a bit too weird, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of people every day (by actor) and gets a great performance-quality type. Although not nearly sad as Umberto D, both movies have a very similar point - this one just makes it a very absurd way. Ignoring the special cheesy effects - after all, it was born in the early 1950s and special effects are not very important anyway (or at least they should not be in film). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and funny ride. Unless you are a total warrant, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I reviewed this first movie, I've seen another movie movie that is an absolute must-see and the CHILDREN are watching US. While not a fantasy or light of mind like Miracle in Milan, a big movie anyway.
