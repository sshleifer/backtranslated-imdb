Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie did not have a tough, total of IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool does not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first doing it was really something. When the movie came out of the flicker in theaters. When she came out on my sister video and I would watch her twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed with good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forget, such as the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly mob. Many people died on this ship, and transmitted that on film and immediately with the emotion it needed is a difficult challenge that James Cameron was up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. If not the relationship was a face of a person's imagination. They knew each other, but they would die for each other. They made each other. They make sure that hell will give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I will never let go, Jack." Titanic is a huge movie down to it's very core. It's a powerful story said of acting noise, excellent cinematography, nice music, and a full crew of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows myself when someone says they hate this movie.
