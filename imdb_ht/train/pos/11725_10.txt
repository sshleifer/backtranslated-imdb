I jump in freeware Boob reference, so I'm just going to write a clear flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira, not in an "I'm-will-to-shoot-to-shoot-to-be-just-to-be-impressed-today-foster-fan" way, but hard to say I think it's rocky. The movie is played as a 50's horror movie just a lot more fun, look for "Leasurely stroking the ankle" reference to know what I mean. What's the brightest relay of the movie is the Elvira (or should be kassandras) absolute charm. I saw this first movie at Tender Age at 8, and saw it endless times since .. I realy would be around to buy a copy, the video showroom is looking a little worse for the set. If any other fan of the movie wants my e-mail about it feel free. <br /> Another great performance from Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah) an actress who never gets attention to it deserves.
