This Baby Baby Burlesk short to be released, and probably one of the most popular, is a parody of the 1926 movie silently What Glory Prize. I look at this and I do not understand the kiddie porn being claimed. It's just a nice little movie. I saw family shows that I grew up watching the '80's and' 90's that little girl dressed more provocatively to act in a 'mature manner'. It was more provocative because they were not dressed in diapers. There is nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of these fetishes. (just a joke) I read the movie description and where it says only a pedophile would enjoy watching it. This is sick. For me, if you look at this and are bothered by it, then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it harms you. It is an innocent film that has been made as an imitation of another movie. All of B.B. They were parody, nothing more. The parody / parody of today is graphic in nature and has true pornography and quite old language. Should not people be more terrible? I can watch people without problems, but sometimes they take the children's stories and turn them into holes on these parody. That should get under your skin. Not being babbled (not a word, I know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how pornographic these silent films were, huh? Not to mention these 'prohibited Hollywood Pre-Code movie epoch' so old and dirty. They would never do these things today? (remember sarcastic a)
