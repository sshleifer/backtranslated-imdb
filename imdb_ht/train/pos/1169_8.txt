Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven blood. Also cheese, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. He reminds me a lot of the Big Heat because it has the plot revenge put in by the exact same event, and the girl comes around the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. It's sad to have no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could anyone like such as Alain go to a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? But it is totally hard with cool ice. No one can now touch it - even though someone like the Law of Jude can try to guess. Hard for any girl to look good with her. The music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chassis (and that's not generally my cup) - especially one Willy nilly one in the woods. People also met the dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for example in a junkyard cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the atmosphere in general has been affected and expertly pulled. More creativity, excitement and freshness in that movie "forgotten" than most of what I've seen lately.
