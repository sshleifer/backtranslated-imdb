Aro Tolbukhin was burning alive seven people in a Guatemala Mission in 70 years. He also claimed that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then put them in fire). This film is a documentary that portrays the personality of Aro in several interviews with people who came to know him and in some scenes played by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analyzes, it does not spell at all. Such a terrible testimony about how some children's trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 7/10
