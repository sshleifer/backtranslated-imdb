It is still satisfied when a detector wrapped up a case with the criminal is brought to books. In this case the highest score gives me even greater pleasure. To see the smile of smoking wiped off Abigail Mitchell's face when he realized his victim had left "death testimony" that left no doubt about his guiltiness very satisfied. Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really, * really * irritates me. It is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting on a little 'little girl' act that is embarrassing of a woman at her age. Worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and execution against her husband's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo gets too close she tries to unnerve her by manipulating her to make a cut-out talk in a high-grade audience. It turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very hot and humorous talk about the facts of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final Abel in his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect for his job well. Here is a situation you can not squirm out of Ms Mitchell!
