I really think I should do my case and have all (horror and movie) movie-buff go and see this movie ... <br /> I did! Excellent: very atmospheric and disconcerting and scary ... <br /> <br /> Incredible how could you make such a gem in a movie that has plenty of bar (it - "no"!) - budgets were ... "One morning, an old man wanders from the woods in search of his runaway cat .He finds instead a child without parents and a murderer with no corpses ..." On this website (IMDb) there is no trailer, but I'll leave a link here at the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer that is quite unsettling so please go and check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
