This is simply the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. It does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched. <br /> <br /> Earth is funny, turbulent and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that makes me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what our treasure has blessed with, but we do not appreciate it one bit. /> <br /> This movie should show binding at school. It is the most wonderful movie you'll ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe it is the last time we could see our planet like this ... <br /> 10/10, but I would be able to read more if it was possible.
