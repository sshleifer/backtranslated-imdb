The first time I saw it when it was premier over ten years ago. I've seen it again today and it has always had a big impact on me. He fought alone is about a girl Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who was raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a girlfriend who loves girls injured. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when he reveals it is rape on the click turned on, led by pond (played by Brian Austin Green). This film Caitlin's movie story against an entire city, including a high school that essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment, allowing them to get away with whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the top performers, and there are real chemistry between the two of them in the entire movie. All of the actors in this movie, which were inspired by actual events, did a great job. It fought itself really capturing the essence of what it is like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and having self-esteem and reputation in pole. Recommended. 10/10
