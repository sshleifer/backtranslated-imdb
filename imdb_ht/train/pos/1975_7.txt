It seems that it will become fashionable rip "Basic Instance 2," to the point that a significant part of the hearing (including criticism) found it terrible even before it was released. It looks even more fashionable Sharon Stone litter that loves all of us ?? is now fourteen years older, and ?? unlike most of us ?? always looks wonderful. First comment on this movie was so vicious that I saw for myself. In my opinion, this end is not nearly as good as the original movie, but not as bad as most comment pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, nor Henry Bean and Leora Barish Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instance 2" is just an entertainment, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry's original notes, keeping its small resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives its character a different dimension, creating a lustful, damnally Catherine Trimell, who can be perfectly classified among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is a clever actress who is not afraid to take risks and can play with her leisure camp. Unfortunately, it seems they are the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick of films. It has become too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, time has arrived and is now tied to be destroyed by Hollywood audience. The cast is exceptional, giving performance far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is impeccable, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise dimensional character. Since it has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, it can keep your attention from beginning to end. I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a big movie; I just expressed my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that other agendas than the movie itself will put the opinion of most viewers.
