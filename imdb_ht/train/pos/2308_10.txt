I checked this out as an impulse when surfing in the movie store and could not have been any more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together, and we enjoyed it very well. It is not the typical "chick-flick" movie with a heart and tale love story all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end. It's a unfinished place, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not hurt by it. I think Reese Witherspoon was a big actress even in this movie, his first, and this is definitely worth seeing! I did not recognize many of the actors supporting, but they all play important roles to support well. "Man of the Moon" is such a credible story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. Most women can definitely relate to everything-from Witherspoon's words, its subtle slides, and it's not so subtle emotions (raging like the typical girl's girl). While playing a confused character on love, it does not come across as comical and immature, which has greatly appreciated considering many movies today.
