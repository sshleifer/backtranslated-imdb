This is not theatrical theater. You should not expect it to be expected. This is the most fun girl and the most fantastic cast of female driving. Like someone else here said, this Mama's baby movie is meant to be. And the only downside I saw this film is that Tina Fey was not in it-besides that it stars the smartest and brightest stars on the planet. This movie is more reliable on the surface, but if you really look you'll know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning in any of us who want to be able to come back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know right now. PIRES fun and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
