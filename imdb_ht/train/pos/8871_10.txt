This was a great movie that had a lot of underlying problems. He faced problems of rosism and class. But it also has a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. This movie was very profound she was giving the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. It also shows that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are the only way you'll ever fit into the society. Which others think you are not important. I believe this movie has done a wonderful show. The actors I think they were able to transmit each beautiful character. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. At a glance just glancing you would not see how deep the film is, but over more look you see the meaning outlined in the movie.
