I just got to thirteen when I first saw this series and I watched it again, on DVD, about thirty years later. The photos on the open credit never leave me. It has affected me to see the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me, and we still discussed the program afterwards. She gave me a love of studying stories and the highest brands I got on our public school exam! Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery are timeless and perfect. I find out that those who lived in it would feel that this is their version of the history of World War II. I can not imagine ever getting bored looking at her. Perhaps a set of fold fighters can now be contemplated, although who can replace Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> Buy It!
