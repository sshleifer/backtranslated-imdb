I first steal the LoG accidentally one night while watching TV: since that time, I never miss an episode. <br /> <br /> Humorous humorous humor, such as a cross between British social sources, is an excellent one-piece show, with an amazing plot that seems to develop every week without ever going anywhere . The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special thing - what was that all about? <br /> <br /> The humor will not appeal to all. Some will say it's just too sick, and it's easy to see where they're coming from. However, give it a try. If you do not like it, do not look it, but if you do like it you will be very happy you've taken my advice.
