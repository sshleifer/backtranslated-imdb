Well, I would consider Police History as one of Jackie Chan's best films. The plot, the scenes fighting with the cascade works are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acting as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) has been successfully arresting a Lord's crime. After the Lord's crimes were released because of lack of evidence, he was chanting Chan to kill a police officer. Because of this, he became wanted by the police. After that, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime, went to a mall and started stolen the crime's crime crimes against her computer and prepared to pass on to Chan. However, the crime master knew that Salina had downloaded her incriminating data and henchmen employees to take it. After that, Chan appeared in the scene and began to fight against all the henchmen and beat them one by one. In the past scenes, Chan saw the punching of the Lord's crimes. Lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Very recommended.
