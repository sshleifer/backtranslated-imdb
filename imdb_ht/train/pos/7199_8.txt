Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has a series of flop plays after a great hit. She receives a play by a student at her, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) who is fantastic. It's so good Sidney says he would kill him. Is It? <br /> A person's thriller. It was originally a game ... and it shows. It's mostly about one and all talk, but I've never been bored. It is very well written with many twists and a good working full force. Caine is just as great as Bruhl - another one of his great performances. Reve is, amazing, very good. I never thought so much of her as an actor, but she's really good at that role. Dyan Cannon does wonderful with an underlying role as Bruhls' wife. Irene Worth is good (and quite funny) as Helga's Drop, a Psychic. However, the accent he found on my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his one series. The camera constantly moves and keeps your attention away. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be bad sociopath and it also has one of the most unromantic kisses I have ever seen - but these are serious complaints .... good thrills. Criticism hates this movie (for some reason) and seems to have disappeared completely since it premiered in 1982. That's too bad - it deserves better.
