I thought it was a great movie for kids ages 6-12. A little bit tired, but the story is striking a cool one. It proves that a teenager's dream can really be fulfilled. I think it's a great story for any kid that is feeling down, or feels as though there are attempts to junk too much stuff in the middle. Very 'beautiful' movie. Bravo.
