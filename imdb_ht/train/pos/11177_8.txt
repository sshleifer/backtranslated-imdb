***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What's really scary you? Shark killer, or perhaps ghost trying to bring back a message? Maybe a psychopath touch scam? <br /> Perhaps. But people fear not even compared to a horror who dare not even talk about or consider - and that's the death of one's own one. "Pet Sematary" wobin that base, scary fear adult, and then taking it to the most unlikely places to bring them explore. <br /> I have read comments about this movie that include poor acting, character making stupid decisions, etc. I do not agree. Acting is actually the first rate for a movie like this. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair from such a scenario. But the movie event is not only logical, can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario was possible. This is the true horror of "Pet Sematary": It is not that pets and people returned from the death as evil killer who hunts with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who lost a child could have become so desperate as they commit the crimes that Louis Belief do. Despite warnings, or even past stories. <br /> <br /> The movie takes people who want to go with it to the depths of a human desperate heart. The heart of a protector tries to make up so they can not be protected. And the results are worried. In fact, when diving into the movie slasher movie near the end, it's almost a disappointment, although I think it's perfectly logical how it's been. <br /> I'm a true horror fan, and I keep that one of the horrific horrors ever made. If you do not think so, watch it again after you have children.
