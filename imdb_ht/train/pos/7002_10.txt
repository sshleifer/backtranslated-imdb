Will Smith rescued again in a movie about a man and the world's weight on his shoulder and his crusade his wrong right in a way that will touch even more stubborn hearts. Writer Grant Nieport and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and create a masterpiece that I highly recommend to buy and hold in your movie collections as you will never grow tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith as it is not just a brilliant actress but one can say he has a genuine love for people and life without having to make it perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) play in this movie. You will find yourself feeling pain and anger, frustration over her love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, which by the way was Fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact that the characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson is also the star of this Top Notch movie star. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving the point to draw key ... All I can say is, Watch it and when you make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone to the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious and last life of IRS Agent Ben Thomas ... I thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
