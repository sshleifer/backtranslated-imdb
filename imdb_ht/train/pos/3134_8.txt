This was a well-written story of making Batman's Sitcom and actually assembling our heroes on a great quest as well as offering TV to show stories. Contrary to Brady's documentary films and Partridge documentaries, we not only get a look at the past and present lives of Adam and Burt, but also get them back into action. Filled with the Kapow and Chatwomen and the Riddler (s), Batman is back in quite well said, history that not only gives us a close to meeting the Batman series, but full of the modern fan of all the Hollywood stories that are about to ' you've heard in 35 years. <br /> Kudos !!!
