I stopped short of giving "Mr. Blandings to build his dream home" 10/10 due to an aspect that made us in the 21st century cringe a bit: the fact that a black man is the loyal servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin fetchit). But other than that, the movie is a looking. Presenting middle class New York couples Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) are trying to build a home in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is her usual flippant, while Loy does well quite a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Bill Muriel's attorney Jim Cole, which seems to have more plan than it does. As for the home itself ... in all of the movie, you will probably feel ambiguous as to whether you want to live there. Builders, contractors, and others also give their fair share of laughs. <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic comedy. Also begins Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
