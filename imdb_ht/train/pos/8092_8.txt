I arrived on this movie as an old 8-10 year old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was out all day, freezing, and when I was coming around around 4pm, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was amazed to look at a cartoon that was not all happy and funny - and it was in fact dark, and moralist. It captured my imagination. I'm sure it lacks the text, and it is abbreviated to everywhere for Purist Purist. But it always captures the spirit of the story, the choice brings a good burden to others, the consequences of selfishness, rash decisions, etc. The quality of animation leaves room for complaints. But one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterization. Jan Hurt is great at that. If you do not like how the character draws, look far, and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it again, many times and still brings me back to that time, like a kid, thirsty for some magical adventure. It's the reason I say 'lucky', the movie is nostalgic for me so I neglected its imperfection. But between John Hurt, and Tolkien's fantasy, he always came to me, and he still does.
