The summer was so full of Blockbusters and comebacks in film, and not to mention some of the deceptions of these comebacks, that I was unlucky to find a movie I could just sit and enjoy. <br /> In case you do not want to read further down the page (no deflator), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than Ella enchanted (some violent part, lots of deaths, and a little hand in scene with a little blood, not for small children), but do not try to overly troin or exceed its limitations. Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical princess bride, and you will be locked. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ I'm, perhaps, not as prodigious of a movie visitor like others ... Perhaps once or twice a month, if I feel active. I'm also a great sci-fi / fantasy fan. I get bored of removing line repetitive lines and films that are more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> At the end of here (August), I was tired enough of fracture expectations from the big hit that I avoided seeing Ultimate Bourne in favor of Stardust. Having hoped that I was inspected by Transformers for my fiction addiction, Stardust forecasts seemed appealing, but I was certainly cautious. I went to think of seeing another fantasy crack click here from breakfast. You do not need to be fooled, it's definitely a fairy-tale, and it's all right there are witches, magic, and utterly asking for the suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's not based on my 'you see it or her in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie. <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other movies that seem to be persistently re-appearing like thorns on one side, maybe a sign that Hollywood is running out of mind? I could read a book this year, and the Two years of film should come out as another "Epic fantasy story, the love of LotR and the rest" so tell the NYT and those and they have no doubts.)) <br /> <br /> Estel√® did not make me bolted in my chair because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating because the draw-hook after draw-hook threatened to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater of a boom loud. He did not even use enormous explosions in the sounds to grab my attention to what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). He is not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor has he offended my intelligence and dimwitted dialogue with simple story lines I could have calculated from 3rd (my boys I hate). <br /> I just ... look. Look, and enjoy a CREATIVE scenario scenario unfold before me. Sure, I can know what was going to happen to most of the movie, but it made you forget that. It even made my heart twinge in some parts, but the most important aspect I've noticed is that I let the theater feel better than when I was going in. It's really a gem. And so many this summer and many remarks and films that fall short of my expectations, this was like a cold cup of cold covering all the hard work I would do to sit in the others trying out of them with my money and vo. <br /> It's probably not for everyone, but to make yourself a favor; If you like fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Boiler, Crystal in Black, etc.) then you should really see this movie. This little diamond is finding its way to my DVD collection at the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Simply Wonderful.
