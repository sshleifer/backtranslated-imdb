Sure, she quickly became unmatched after this movie, but in the "Cutter in the Water" up until the "Tenant", Roman Polanski could still rely on delivering something fascinating and unique. Although many run terms (alienation, paranoia), none of its films are really similar. The story of this is a bit similar to its own "Repulsion" in ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. The "Tenant" manages darker scores than dark absurdity (I'm a bit hesitant about calling it humor, though protagonists are scarcely behaved with dialogue and dialogue) and some paranoia is really suspendedful. Polanski has always been a master of building anxiety, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. The overall foreign of the film is also a plus. <br /> In addition to the exclusive Polanski as usual, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. Polanski is the actor often overshadowed by the director Polanski, but his performance here truly captures his character and sense of being a outcast. The subjects of social discrimination make this film more than just strangely for the sake of being weird. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially Isabelle Adjani turning sympathetic, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters' are just as annoying. The "Tenant" is often overlooked because of how people are ready to be praised over both "Repulsion" and "Baby Rosemary", but it's just as brilliant as either of these classics. (9/10)
