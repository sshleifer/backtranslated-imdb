Not only say it all. I watched this movie with my dad when he came out and served in Korea he had great admiration for the man. This disappointing thing about this movie is that it only focuses on a short period of man's life - all of life's exciting life is made as a bio-pic season that it is stupid to imagine the cost of production. <br /> Some elute posters in these flawed features of the man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Homework, Honor, Country" is not only words flattering from the mouths of a high-brass officer - it is the deep declaration of total devotion one person to his country. Ironically, Peck was the liberalist that he had won a better understanding of the man. He performed a great deal of showcasing the courage to the human side of the man.
