My favorite movie ever! I saw many movies, but this one hit all of them! Excellent act, wonderful story. You will, as a "normal" caretaker begin to love George. Alto is she is an actor, she is also herself with a very adorable person. And maby the most important thing: you will learn to respect & look different with people with Down Syndrome.
