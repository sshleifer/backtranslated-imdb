While a pretty nice music, what stuck with me on this movie was unexpected chemistry of comedy between Basil Rathbone, as was the composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high nourishing, artistic distraction (a far cry from his more familiar role as either ominous villains or Sherlock Holmes's logic of Sherlock), Rathbone's character seems he could not find his way out of bed without help. With this help Starbucks, played with his usual drug humor by Oscar Levant. When Crosby's character was hired as his writer writer writer, Rathbone introduced him to Starbuck when he said, "It's all my thoughts for me." Levant replied, "Ah, it's just a time job partial.

Too bad he did not have more opportunities to show his comedy talent.
