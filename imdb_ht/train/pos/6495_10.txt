10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, and movie clips from the war who did not see for years, as long as this was screened in 1974. The movie clips in this documentary come out In the war not to miss out, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. Simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now more than 25 years old is still able to pack a tremendous punch. You must watch this at some time, though it's a few episodes, even in that you will always be blown to this impact to documentaries to those who have suffered and died in the name of war, in a world of war ..
