Star Hidden Trunks Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it's a fan made series, available only on the internet, and features especially friends and neighbors with computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines, as Mickey & Judy once put it, put on a show. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you can say. A lot of these people are not as wonderful as they look you've ever seen, or the least, or the end ?? some of them stumble in the lines like they are walking on marble ?? Some of them are thick, or simply do not seem to speak well in the first place, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand one single solitude word that they say. Still, you must admit, for all these friends and neighbors to join together, it's actually fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a little odd (though admit a little cool too) watching from Starfleet boy kissing (although some of the kiss scenes seem to go on and off.) Yes, you cringe a bit when they Clearly quotes from ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of each show. Agree. We can not get that. Why? Graphics are the first percentage. Better than almost anything you've ever seen. And sometimes, a show or two really means out history-wise ?? Some of them are actually real worn-jerkers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> but you must give people involved credit where credit is due. It takes great effort to put on a production of this magnitude. People, lying, costume, graphic ?? It's a great effort on a lot of people's part. We look, we return, and we thank them.
