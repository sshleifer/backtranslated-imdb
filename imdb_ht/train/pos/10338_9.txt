Norman, is that you are? (this is all the third but so take it with a single tablet) fits into an African American family from a Jewish one, when he did the transition from stage to screen. Also, it was one of those original movies filmed in video, so the imagery from the theater might not have been great. Still, performance by Redd Foxx and others were very good. <br /> What I meant to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD Period: it reflects their attitude in the middle of early 70s on finding out you have a gay son or daughter of your family. For this reason alone, it is very interesting - if not a little "hollywood". Do not believe me? Check lines on curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> But the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side scene divided when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who's running with his brother (!) Ensenada in a pinto souped up. The telephone conversation across the border is really memorable. But the ... The best scene in the film is when Wayland Flowers and Madame made her gay routine that she used to do in gay bars and boxes. For the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's slightly clear up with shorter versions, I said. Still, she's ex-wife, and not to be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; The man was really smart. Enjoy the movie!
