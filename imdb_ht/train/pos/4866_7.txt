First of all, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Rogers generals would be very misused as Alyce, the young British lady who has the title role. Fontaine makes a picture as the heroine here, but she acts inexperience to show badly and dancing her best left unmentioned. Fortunately, he went to the best of things. <br /> But here it is FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who find the top bills - and they are excellent. Fans of Burns & Allen will be amazed at how easy to fit into the Astaire's routine. Especially interesting is the routine of fun palace that contained choreograph Hermes Pans an Oscar. They join Astaire in what has to be invented most film in the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not many can say that the slow slowing of the story - or some of the stale situations that call for a lot of patience in the viewer. It must be said that some of the humor fell flat with the usual romantic occurrences that occur in any of Fred Astaire's films in this conventional conventional treatment. Only the music interludes to give the story up is needed. <br /> There are some nice Gershwin tunes pop up once in a while, but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. Just great support includes Reginald Gardiner, at its best in a humorous comedy performance as a corrupt server, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father mistakes as a garden by Astaire). <br /> It's a lighthearted corner every time Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were on radio and television days. Both of them are amazingly inxic to keep up with Astaire's footwork. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine's Haleyid dance with Fred is filmed in a secret but smart camera-work distance can not disguise the fact that he is from his element as dance partner The asteroid, something it looks great awareness is aware of.
