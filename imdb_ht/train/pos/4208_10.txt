Every now and then has come to release this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time and very little money and resources, but everyone goes crazy about and turns out to be a one surprisingly great. This also happened in the '50 and quite a few little movies, which many people have never heard of. There are really some great gems surprised jewels from the '50 that are worth digging out. "Panic in the streets" is another movie like what's the source of the idea. Both are movies that do not really like their usual flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> I was really surprised at how much I finished this movie. It was really a movie that was best and best as it progressed. Like all 'old' movies it tends to start sort of slow down, but once you get into the story and its character you are in for a real treatise with this movie. The movie has a really great story that involves espionage, even though the movie does not start in like that. It starts like this funny crime-thriller with a touch of movie-noir in it. But "Pickup on South Street" just is not really a movie by the numbers so it begins to take its own direction very soon on. He ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really worthwhile one to look. <br /> I also really loved the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys and they are all the flaws and weaknesses. Really human. He also specifically features a great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for. She really had to be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. Even though its budget is somewhat obvious this bar is simply a great, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen no more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
