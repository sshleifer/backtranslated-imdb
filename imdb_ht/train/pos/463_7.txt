Of course the scheme, script, and, especially the strong casting of the movie. So many great things to see. An aspect I liked especially is the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <the antagonist - the Luzhini (Turturro) - former adviser working his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent - an Italian dandy of three pieces and sticks - turns out to be a real golf, and a true chess player is fine. His credit "opponent" nobly went along with the plan to end the final game for the posthumously tournament (Luzhin took a flyer out of a window - sad, but so disclosed it) by way of the unstable genius' Widow (Emily Watson.) In death, then, because of the sculpture of a lady lady honorable lady, Luzhin's defense (which she worked out at a delayed time to lucidity) allowed to be played. The Italian Golan recommends the play and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic play "end!"
