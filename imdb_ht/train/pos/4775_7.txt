If it's the action and adventure you want in a movie, then you would be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with this attitude, check out "The Right Story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as gentleman and gentlemanly Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his alien brother who had a congestion cerebral. Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as it travels long and winding roads, makes friends of strangers and doling out many tips of grandfather's family on the road. The story moves along as slowly as the mower rises, but somehow manages to keep view of the viewer, waiting for Alvin's next life lessons to be offered. <br /> <br /> Stretching on the couch, relax and enjoy. It is the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book.
