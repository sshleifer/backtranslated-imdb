I try to watch it every day most of the time, and even though I watched it for the past 4 years, I have not seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The show is about Danny Tanner who is guy who makes news for sports. His wife is killed by a car accident from a drink driver and asks Jesse, an Elvis Maniac and a motorcycle and has an obsession in his hair. Joey, an adult teenager and voice of cartoon ever in taking care of her three girls, Donna Joe, called her DJ, Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. /> They all live under a roof that no one helps them out. <br /> <br /> Then at the show, Jesse gets a girl friend and later married her and have twins, Nicki and Alex. (this begins to happen in the new seasons) This show is awesome, if you like the life of the suite of Zack and Cody, so Raven, the Boy Satisfied the World, and Designing Women, you'll love this. (It starts to get better in the unfinished seasons) Look at it, you'll love it!
