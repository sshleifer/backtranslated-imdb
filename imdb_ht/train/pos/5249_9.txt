The choice of making this SNL skit in a movie was far more thought out than the other contemporary. Humor involving the character is not annoying humor, and also character driving is sufficient to be stretched for an hour or two. <br /> Oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it can be avoided, but that might have been because the constraints in live television live I do not expect it. I suppose I was thinking of more "Leisure Suit Larry" risking than the producers were ... <br /> <br /> Definitely not a PG-13 movie, which will probably hurt her ever since reaching the height of his most successful success, but still better citing and writing than what is his greater involvement. <br /> I love it, but I doubt it will be a hit crash ... (which is sad, as Tim Meadows tends to not make characters that annoy me and frequently other SNL former tenders tend to)
