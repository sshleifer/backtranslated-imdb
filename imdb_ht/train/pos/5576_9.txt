This movie is hilarious! I looked at her with my friends and we just saw her again. This movie is not for you movie guys who will only watch the movie nominated for Academy Awards (you know who you are.) I will not recapture it because you've seen it from all the other comments. <br /> <br /> "Hit" is a light-hearted comedy that has been laughing at all. It does not matter itself seriously and should look with your friends, not your girlfriend. It will not have any awards, but it just has to be looked at to be appreciated. True, some of the bath humor jokes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of it sometimes. Some people need to brighten up and see "pour" for what it is, is not it. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 from *****.
