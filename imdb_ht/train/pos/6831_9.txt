I know only one other movie that might be perhaps night competition with this Bergman's Persona. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a wealth of hard ideas to grasp at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relationship of art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she plays on stage than she wants. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who claims to love her for Myrtle and is then hit by a car, leaving a deep mark in the actress. She starts asking herself questions related to her aging that begins to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But this does not help much with Myrtle is one step away from complete filling. The scene where he killed imaginary (or not) the spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a genius display on behalf of the director as he filmed a theater scene where he and Gena Rowlands impressed a scene, since Myrtle came too late into the opening night to make his party accurately. This scene was filmed naturally, with a live audience, the laugh is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or interested in a movie that offers considerable ideas and great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine.
