The night reader is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd, but very different film. I can guarantee you never seen this kind of movie before. Some people maybe will not like the slow slowing of this movie, but I think it's more of the big movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that came out in 2006. He has an intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, feeling dramatic. This is not American movie. Nor is it a predictable film. You just feel that it's a secret movie that you have a hard time to determine what the result of it can be. This is not an excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a good movie and very original movie.
