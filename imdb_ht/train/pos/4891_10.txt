A great concept, a great cast, and what mercy has not had more time and meat out the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now have some REAL women! Still, Dench and his character alone had enough substance to bring the script to some of his lesser moments. I have it on tapes and will continue to watch it, hoping to have a sign at the end that suggests there will be an end. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No question! - No argument! <br />
