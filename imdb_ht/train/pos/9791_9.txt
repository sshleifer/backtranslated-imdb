I will not give anything away from describing the plot of this movie other than saying that it starts and returns to Israel at a young blind woman closest to friends and companions have just committed suicide. It unfolds as a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friends ended her life. While pursuing his investigation and accumulated information, he led inevitable to a devastating conclusion. This film is a rhythm and acting expert, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film has definitely come to age and is now completely competitive with other foreign films, though some have found a great audience in the United States.
