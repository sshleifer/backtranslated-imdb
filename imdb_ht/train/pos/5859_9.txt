This cool Marvel superhero game pays tribute payers by staying true comics. Of all the surprised superhero games that were so lame and weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improved in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman Funny. As you would expect Spiderman to do whatever a spider can. It does more than turn fabric. In fact, it uses them as weapons and shields. When it does not use the internet in combat, it punches and kicks too. Spidey has his hands full as he fights Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a queen. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels are difficult, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a real fan of superhero fancy, this game is for you but does not expect long gameplay. The best chance of "Spiderman 2." My assessment: 9 out of 10.
