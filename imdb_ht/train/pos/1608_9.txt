Seeing "Moonstruck" after many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this movie was when it appeared first. Who knew Cher could act? Who has ever heard about Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was at the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comic talent, nor was the Norman Jewison director. <br /> <br /> Just really flatten the note of this splendid task is "When the Moon seeks your eyes like a pizza pizza, which is love," a song that sings many times in the movie (once it is already too many) and has gone to have a long time of popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensationalist as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to marry and not be loved by the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges not to propose, offering her pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushing down to Sicily to be with her dead mother. He accused Loretta and saw in his French brother Ronny, going to the wedding. Loretta meets Ronny and quickly fell in love with her. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on his mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovered when Ronny invited her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> All work from the end, as it inevitably does in the movie of this genre. In the meantime, all actors find themselves admirable with the audience enjoying themselves. In its way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rolling entertainment with no social significance as well. If they only lost "This romantic" on the road, it would have been perfect.
