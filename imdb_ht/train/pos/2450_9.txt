I watched this show since I was 14 and I loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just plain funny! You will enjoy this show very much because it shows something new and funnier every day and my favorite part is when Benny still has her latest comment on George after every punchline on her fat head. * Street * I would laugh and I would watch it with my friends at home it would be like we were watching a comic but short film. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a cool comedy-friendly comedy family of everyone and you will definitely enjoy it - I did! But if you have not looked at it again I suggest that you start watching because you do not want to stop watching it. Though no longer brand new episodes I still enjoy re-running. Still funny. Never put on it. <br /> 9/10
