I'm glad I've seen this movie saw some of the movie's other films in the past. I thought their production value was as big as costume and environment with the bridge. It was interesting to see how the concept of mind and devil was occupied. <br /> I agree with some of the other comments on the battle scene. They were hard to follow at times. <br /> <br /> Finally, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought of the movie. It's a movie I'd like to see again. <br /> There are some scenes like those where Benkai and the Prince fought on a "psychic" level were well done. came out of the movie thinking what happened just here. Intans.
