Closer to me ever came to see this was a clip shown on a Gerard Philippe display in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the renewal and it had just kept the original just over half a century after it was made I can only conclude that the stupid fence was intentional, aimed at a long oversized target. Hollywood has made realistic sword fighting since the 30s when the greatest of them all, Basil Rathbone, crossed the blur and Errol Flynn and others for the technique was available and so that left only satire. After a while you do not notice and revel in the jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence of bringing in a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a tad better than Martine Carol, other obvious candidate at the time. The print I've seen was particularly bad and at a breaking point so maybe a DVD version would improve it.
