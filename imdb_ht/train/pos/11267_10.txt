Robert Wuhl is teaching a movie student film at New York University in Manhattan, New York. It covers the illusions of history and truths that are not generally known. I would like to see more of this show. It's very fun. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and tells" to get his points across. He explained that those who actually went up at midnight at Paul Revere did not revere Paul! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because he was bleeding better. <br /> I looked at Robert Wuhl for many years, since he was standing up comedy with the way to "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedy stand-up, but he's an excellent teacher! I highly recommend that you watch an episode in this show. It is well worth your time.
