As her predecessor earlier, "The Man of Elephant" Lynch proves his dexterity that he can tell a straightforward story, simple without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of a senior retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decided to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his fraternal brother who is now standing at the door. A nice note from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (like these corn field garden shots), with a sly director of the saga revealing human humanity, this is a nice slice of life movie. Slowly it can calm down some viewers in sleep, but those who stay together for the ride will be rewarded at the end.
