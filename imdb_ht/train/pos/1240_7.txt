Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters her life, she says she is the one to choose and she must find the Golden Child. Submissive and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realizing it is about to embark on a fabulous journey, one involving the worst and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. produced in its time?, what do I mean, was Eddie Murphy and the Golden Childhood popularity besides the late 1980s? For me to note how much this movie has been popular in the past decade, it's box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the 8th largest earner in 1986, but since the 80s faded out of memory he came Of the things Eddie Murphy denied comedy photos comedy that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the most accepted picture of 80 Murphy like commerce and Beverly Hills cop, but on the recent movie I personally find out that he has Murphy in his wisecracking, quipping and better!, Seriously. <BR>> <br /> The cash on a formula of fantasy action was reinvigorated and temporary-recorded by Raiders in the Lost Box in 1981, the Golden Child hit all the genre button required. Pretty girl, nana reluctantly-heroes and a quip in her army, superb wicked {Charles Dance for English I could kiss her myself}, wonderful colors, and a cute kid and mystical power, the only movie asking you to participate in the fun, do not jump and digress it is worth as a crawling fantasy image. Yes the CGI demon seems critically right now, and yes the genre was far better photo of the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the shame rating of 5 here on this site Then you can just get this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10
