Maybe it was not that good as a whole, but the second episode, which was the first one I said, was so memorable I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mystery. <br /> <br /> The croak slang in the Sidekick, Chico Barnes, is a lot more fun to give to those who have never been close to hearing the London Bells Bow, but driving them to attract and show them interesting. Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters, and the show actually minimized some of the difficulties with his hands. Interestingly, the electronics of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after World War II.
