This movie is perhaps the most touching and reliant I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. A sudden realization that there is really meaning in life. <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was skeptical. I thought the plot blown against I was scared that the story would be banal. But being a fan of David Lynch I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and heat in this film! I left feeling the movie that I really learned a valuable thing about life. This is not a typical film by David Lynch, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a movie after exploring dark places in human nature for many years. On the other hand, I'm not surprised that it manages to convey deep emotions and deep human impressions because I also thought it managed to be very well in the Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors around and I think the right story is best to read it again. 9.5 / 10
