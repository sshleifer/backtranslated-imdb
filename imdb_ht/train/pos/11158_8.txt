Shocking, well-made chiller is a bulky story of murdering atrocities and evil forces. <br /> <br /> Small town doctor attempts to discover who, or what, is committed to violent sexual violence. <br /> <Incubus is a tight mystery, with some horrible murderous sequences, built in a cut-off and unusual climatic twist. The murder scenes are intense and gory, so this is not a movie for the outlet! The direction of John Hough, along with a rare music note, combines to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs out of the movie. It also brings a Gothic gothic type too. Nice where manure and some stylish camera work also emphasize. Throw is not bad either. The Great Cassavetes John performed a solid performance as the new physician in town. Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as local reporter, Helen Hughes as the city's historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a teen psychic teenager. <br /> <br /> All around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that needs to be -Develop and re-evaluate. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
