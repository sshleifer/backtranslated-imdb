I honestly think that this was the best version of the world war I've seen. It was funny but it was also my education I learned a lot of the movie and if I could I would not that movie. My favorite part was when soldiers killed on robots and another one came right out behind it. At the last movie movie in the world I think it should have been more like the first one and it would be best. but any way I give this movie 2 thumbs up. <br /> and if they're doing another movie like this I'll definitely look at it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks
