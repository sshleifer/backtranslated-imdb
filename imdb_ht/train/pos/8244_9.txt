Love it! What does not like? - You got your suburbia, you got your zombie, you got your family problems, you got your social dilemmas, you got yourself one Fine Retro-1950's style of Meat Sub-grounes held in Bay Do not worry about whether they are eating above the upper crust. You could not ask for more. <br /> Place is superb. Carrie Ann Moss is sheer perfection as a debutant social housewife. It's both violent, and criminal conspiracy. Every fellow's dreams. K'sun is really great as the son just tries to be as normal as possible in the existence of this nightmare, and somehow succeed. It's a genuine screen presence. Very photogenic, and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspect policeman and whitewashed little with little squeamishness as if it's his everyday character. Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido. A fine actor: I wish he had played the title role in "Braveheart," and Gibson headed. My essence is that his William Wallace was closer to the current character. Fido is there, yet accessible. A nice touch. In short, a great and marvelous satiric sting of morals, values, punishes social, feelings, growth, faced in uncertain times, and adjustment of compensation in impossible condition. A true reality show.
