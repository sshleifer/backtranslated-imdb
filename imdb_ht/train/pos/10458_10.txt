This film deals with one of the most scary geriatric scars among the age today. As a person who has met a number of families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's or in the formal stages, I would suggest that each healthcare giver recommends this movie to any family that faces the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reach the heart of the struggle. Distribution is excellent and the dramatic painting is exceptional with a very drawn line order.
