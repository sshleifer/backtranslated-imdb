A lot of problems in many people that have this movie is that they seem to think that the story should be more fun (ignoring it based on a true story) or ranting against a movie that glorifies Che (which he really does not ). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's definitive bio on Che and gets the right story. Soderburgh makes an excellent job of setting the mood for the untold landing of Che's Bolivian adventure. You really get the impression of the total shyness and confusion of peasants in the Bolvian revolutionary idea idea of ​​the Che or the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the arena. Sorry to pay attention to movie fans out but that was how it happened. So do not go to this movie awaiting a rambo shot and up, it's a true story!
