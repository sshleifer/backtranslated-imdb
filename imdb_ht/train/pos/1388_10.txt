"Time of day has ended" is an incredible picture. In some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third type." (I prefer cheesy cats independent spectacularly big budget.) The special effects are cheesy, but that's a great part of the fun. Your davis gives you an excellent performance in this movie. It's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. The music score is very good. The story does not make sense. But just do it all the more. Like many of the best works of art, "the day has ended" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "Time of day has ended" may be an independent budget film, but it is not too much of a stretch to compare it with "European Existence" movie of fifty soldiers and sixties. (many of which gave independent self-funding budgets.)
