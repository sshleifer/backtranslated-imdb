I began to lose my faith in the film they were contemporary in flooding with the typical Hollywood movie. Lines of history fail, and camera work simply copying from the latest movie to similar flavors. But then I saw Centropa (Europe) and my faith renewed. Not only is the storyline enthralling metaphorically, but the use of colors and black and white is visually interesting. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you through a journey spellbounding every step in the way with your hackers in Europa 1945. We all see death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of this movie is how it takes you in every slow-moving moment leading to death. Unlike many films it does not cut off after a second of shows (for example) a knife, but forcing you to look at the devastating beauty again sensuous at the man's final moment. I think we can all take something different away from what this movie tries to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I would like to speak more in depth on the movie for anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
