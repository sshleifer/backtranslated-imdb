This film has several things for her. It's a "feel good" story. Characters and actors are interesting, realistic and present fine performances. Most importantly, I believe Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford seemed good both to throwing and balancing a stick to the "Natural, and that made Kevin Costner's" For Love in the Game "and" Bull Durham. "In" Big League, "Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that photograph was earlier - and not very funny. So many baseball movies earlier, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball capabilities on the drive part, were funny in this respect. In the "Stratton History" and "Air Structural Order," Jimmy Stewart looks as credible as a professional baseball player, such as overweight, non-athletic (such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibits a degree of ability Baseball would put them in the late days while "pick-up" for a game at the Sunday picnic (though elaborate, and even if your uncle was involved). The scene of Quaid's high school team is framed, those where he goes to try it with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor league and in the American League, all true rings. They are credible and capable. In addition, he is an engaged actor who still delivers a talented and inappropriate characterization (except for a degree, some of his "over-the-top" scenes, with his strong accent, in his painting of Jerry Lee Lewis) . But it's definitely sub-target here, and this movie is a "9," as good, or better, like anyone else in this genre, except for the "Natural."
