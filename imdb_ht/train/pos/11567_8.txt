In the 1930's studios would use short films like this one's sort as ground test for new actors, providing relative ease of production in comparison to full-length film feature, so it's interesting that this one should be star Shirley Temple, who has long since established itself as the Most Famous Child of All Time. Then again, it probably was not the one being tested, I would imagine that would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Sonny's brother Shirley in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance. Then again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy action accompanied. The film opens with an unimpressive eye gage that involves a weak ceiling, which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple provide a stupid ceiling, illustrating the working class status of the family in the movie and giving a clean transition at the next stage, which features Shirley gleeously stomping in the rain. <br /> It's Sonny's birthday, and his father strives occasionally and incredibly botched to hide the hiding that he wants to give Sonny a dog that he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he bites not one time and has been eradicated ever since. It's curious that, when her father insists on catching a dog, Sonny decided to run away from home rather than having a dog at home, and as she runs away without having to spot the eye, it's also curious that the movie illustrates What seems to be an indifference to the homeless who justified the same surprising oddity that exists today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! blow the right guy off the tracks, but no problem). After Sonny gives up on breakfast sharing due to the look back that his gleeful smile received from the guy, he continued on with the homeless guy to disappear into the movie. It's interesting to consider what a longer movie would do, because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end. <br /> <br /> That's not what matters, Sonny soon hear a moaning dog under a dried up as it passed on, and jumping down to find a dog covered in claws. He might seem saddened that he immediately took the dog up and adopted it since he just left the house because of his fear of dog, but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded of his power dogs, but in the lack of power over it. As soon as he saw a dog in need, he was scared. <br /> Hey, if that's all it takes, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I wear! <br /> It's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to be, but it's nice enough and enjoyable enough (and short enough, as it was) still have a fun movie. We already do not expect an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but my pardon pup always packs in a substantial amount of history and character development in its short run time. And it also features a battle scene at the end of the movie that must have been made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert in the movie Shirley Temple, but it's not hard to see how it became the famous star star of all time.
