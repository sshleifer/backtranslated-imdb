In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic disease called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which means that his skin literally falls into the slightest touch, leaving his body covered in agonizing sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last month Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton documenting his life and death, and the result was a movie, first broadcast in March, which was an uplifting, confused and humorous comic book of a singular person. By referring to the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived in the full. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Poetry Boy became the most talked about documentary this year. It attracted almost five million viewers after the public screening had given more than half a million books of charity Jonny, DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has set up another half a million dollars with the goal of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy leaves one million livelihoods.
