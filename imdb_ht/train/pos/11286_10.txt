I recommend watching this movie and other important if you are planning a romantic evening with her / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as tarzan and Jane so steam he could blur up the screen. <br /> After the original movie, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have been adapted to the jungle with each other. Jane's skimpy bust supplies and Tarzan's protests when Jane covers up for visitors to be illuminated by just romantic but also sexually loving. <br /> <br /> One imagination One can complete the constant touch and love talking between Tarzan & Jane shows how many Jane is actually teaching tarzan about emotionally, romantic and sexually loving. And Jane's student is not only embracing, but also thriving with untapped sexuality. <br /> <br /> The show in this film is on the charts. In addition to Jane's sexy bathtubs, feet, and hugely hip suits, she also had an underwater naked swim with Tarzan. (although it's not O'Sullivan but Olympic swim Josephine McKim who doubles for her at this stage) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body with perfect pectorals in her barely wool. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller comes out of the water after his long fight with the giant crocodile and his call - and his water dip virtually collapses in its hips. <br /> It's a shame that the subcontractor tone down the adult nature of the Tarzan movie after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still thrive in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
