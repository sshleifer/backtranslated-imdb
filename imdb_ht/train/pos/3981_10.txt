This is my fourth short McDoakes Joe that I've seen and so far a funniest one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a Imite of Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When it comes to Warner Bros. Studio (company behind this series, incidentally), asked Jack Carson for the direction that gets both confused. He then encounters actor George O'Hanlon (also in McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that is not too far from later Geroge Jetson and gets into the series where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how funny I've found the whole thing and was captivated by the movie movie films given near the end. The final scene was specially a stomach on notes, going to YouTube if you want to look so you want them in Picutres!
