It takes bowel to make a movie about Gandhi in India, in which he does not show as a man who could not do any harm. This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent dad (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> Performance is terrific, the fantastic cinematic, the fabulous direction, but the movie dragon. If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office desk, which I assume is the case here then, a brilliant attempt, but if the musicians await this to be a commercial success, then the movie's fate ends the day they chose the topic .. <br /> <br / > 20 years from now, this film will be remembered for the brilliant painting of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserved an Oscar nomination for this one .. And honestly, not the only performance, Shefali Chhaya is also terrific .. <br /> Look at the scenes where Harilal hears about his father 's death .No dialogue, No screaming but a shot interpreting by Khanna. He one of the finest scenes ever shot in the story of Cinema <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my dad is not all exciting movies but yes, his excellent cinema and a must look. Brilliant Attempts ..
