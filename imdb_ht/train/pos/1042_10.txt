An American woman, European husband and children returns home to her mother at "Watching the Rhine," a 1943 movie based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and starring Paul Lukas (who I believe is repeating her step here la), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, often injured, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) is in need of a long vacation on his wealthy mother-in-law estate. But she finds that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests (Coulouris) is suspicious as her true identity and more than willing to sell her out. <br /> <br /> Great performances abound in this film, many writings for liberal point viewers Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda machine at the moment it was released, as the wounds of war and what happened to people in other countries came to American homes. Today's big movie conflict is that Paul Lukas had an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a handsome screen attendant and a fabulous Rick but Lukas was transcendent as Kurt. His monologue on the need for kill is well-wrenching, just to mention one scene. Though this is not a thought of film as a movie Davis, she gives a masterful performance here as Kurt is loyal and loves wife, Sarah. She acted tugs in the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sarah are beautiful and sensitive. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the movie made me tired of the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman not everyone was, but unlike the "Little Foxes", he wrote some really sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story to give value to casting and producing by Warner Brothers. Very recommended.
