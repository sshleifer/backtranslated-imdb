I was so entertained in all this insightful document, and I waited a good time for this to come in the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth the wait. I love a good documentary / special interest piece, but this was definitely a sincere, honest, and nostalgic, if you will, look back on teen life. The imagination of a child is fascinating, and that's where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, funny, and all around fun documentary. Mr. Stein and company have definitely come a long way from Video CamCorder video video to gaming-ups, gay and earrings that turn gay men from at a glance. They all seem rather successful in being respectable fields, and it's good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries, and it features a number of Darren's most remarkable productions, including, Crazy News.
