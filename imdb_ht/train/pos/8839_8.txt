Thank God is not based on a true story, because what a story it is. Population by Despicable Character with Degrading Knowledge There is no limit, Before the Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping outage of pervertion that could be ridiculous (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the undercurrent traumatic illness of human dysfunction all) if he had not carried out with these magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its star. Excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Go patiently too. <br /> The story is told and time-shifts (listed on screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the flight," so nobody should be confused); Some people say they do not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question hardly play with full bridges - between them or not could make a decent but poker to save your life. Throw in these extra cheesy tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, excellent), who has a deal with the other brother, sent to some sibling rivalry monuments, along with the fact that said drug addicted brother hatred to her father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who apparently caused him severe past pain, and you had a Shakespearean / Greek trakie on your hands. Continue with caution.
