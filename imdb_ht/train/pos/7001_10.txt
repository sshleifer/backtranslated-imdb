I never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read her comments saying this movie is with you. It does. It was almost 24 hours and still affected. This movie let me question myself. How can I compare myself with a character like Ben who is totally desperate. I liked this movie. I love movies that keep me guessing and asking until the end. I feel of majority emotions, happiness and sadness. An amazing smile and a very sad movie too. I wanted Ben and Emily together, but in the end, they were, forever. If you have not seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distraction. You will want to see each nuance in this picture. One for my library.
