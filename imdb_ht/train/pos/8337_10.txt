Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore he saw a large number of movies, it is rare that one hit me as totally unique. For this, it is equally rare that I gasping for breath at the street during several scenes. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I would say that is probably the best, as this romantic comedy has the firmly firm ground on "comedy", and in any case it stretches the limits of just credibility a little more than i like the most com com to do. The four scientists provided some of the faint moments by just in this movie, but in any movie I've seen in a long time. I'm hesitant for the briefing at the time before finally choosing a "10" on a "9" as a rating, as I believe too many people to use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I also a great Meg Ryan fan, who helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen in which I would say it is comprehensive to cover. He and Tim Robbins are cast like their drive, but for me to play second play in the antics of the bumbling intellectuals. A genuine movie-lace-loud movie.
