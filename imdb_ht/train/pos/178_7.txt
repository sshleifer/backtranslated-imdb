"Protocol" is a hit-and-missing picture starring Goldie Hawn as a cocktail waitress who has a night save the life of an Arab visit from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job working for the U.S. government. Do the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever have the same thing? Hawn is excellent as usual though "Protocol" is not as funny as his best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I made a lot of laugh. <br /> <br /> *** (from four)
