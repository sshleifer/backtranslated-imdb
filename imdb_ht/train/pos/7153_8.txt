My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, she read it in several of her classes. He never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and I bought the DVD to figure out this would be a movie that would not really have gotten up my go. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I find myself thinking I was good. It starts in a bit slow and I must admit that I was a bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it. Boy, I'm glad I did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would most certainly look this again! <br /> The casting was pretty good. Since I do not read the book, I can not wait for accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really delightful. You love the character you were supposed to love, hate what you were supposed to hate, and laugh at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> I can see how some would not like this movie. It is tiring at times, especially at the beginning. All the flashbacks can be distracted (though they are essential to the story). Once the story begins to come together at the end, though, I think you're paying back to your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
