This was a great movie but it was the worst end I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and showed great talent. The entire story was twisted and unexpecting, which, that's what made it fun. As good as the movie was, the movie is all judged by the ending, which was terrible! Perhaps an end can eliminate this bad end.
