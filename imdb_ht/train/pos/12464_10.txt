Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - What more can you ask for? Monkey-based influenza-based monkey has the same name exploring Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother falls for a worship of Jobe (Friels). A simple story made really extraordinary of all the many actors (in particular Noni Hazlehurst ) and good use of the small budget 4. The only flaw is (if you can pick it up) is that the story is set in Melbourne, although for budget purposes, the movie was mostly shot in Sydney, so as a result , in a few scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then a Carlton post office (Sydney scene) .One time, "Monkey Grip" is a must see (excuse the click, but it is) at least for a Award winning performance at former "Play School" and "Better Homes & Gardens" presenters of Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> 10/10
