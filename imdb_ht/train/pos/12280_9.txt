This is one of the few movies I watched twice in the theater. I really love this movie for its atmosphere and it says in the life of tragic heroes Esteban Trueba. He did many mistakes but became a chance to redemption. Is not that a consensus rather console? <br /> When I saw him for the first time, I thought that after the election, the movie would be over - I did not know the book. So my boy was wrong when the dramatic climate was still coming! I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here completely dislike this movie. I can not understand that one bit. Perhaps those who read the first book - as often as the screen adaptation of novels - simply disappointed that many things have remained untold, unseen, unreasonably. But as a movie that tells a story touching - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, compassion of the bottom of a woman, the strength of love and the frenzy of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is merely superstar! In addition, the band is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. So definitely one of the movie films that were invented for!
