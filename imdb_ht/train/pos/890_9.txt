This is one excellent Sammo Hung movie. Actually, this is a great piece of Hong Kong movie action. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao looking for love and getting mixed up w / a vicious paddler. Their excellent performance and their characters are all likable and well-defined. The story involves and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspension to keep one look between battle scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that it is probably the choreographer to fight better in the business. The action is simply amazing, esp. The battle w / Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. A must see for any fan of action.
