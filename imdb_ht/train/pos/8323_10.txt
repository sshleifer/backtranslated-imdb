"A little nonsense now and then, are the wisest people to love." <br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie, then you're too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Then thank you.
