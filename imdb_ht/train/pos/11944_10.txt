I was going to give it a 8, but since you've made 6.5 people out of a lot better, I've got up my contribution. The river Styx was pure engineering. Sure, Woody was her perennial thing, but at least her role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was smart enough, and the woody card tricks of the parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were fun to watch. This was better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. And a plus, Apprentice a little bit of going along with it. And of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy? Charles Dance is always fun, as was Hugh Jackman.
