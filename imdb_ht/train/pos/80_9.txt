I really enjoyed the great reunion! I would have rated it a 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". Not even a mention of where they are today or why they did not participate in the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation of their lack of appearance. Anyway, I was happy that TNN runs the series again! I was looking for episodes for years and so happy to be able to tape the entire set (I may miss a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
