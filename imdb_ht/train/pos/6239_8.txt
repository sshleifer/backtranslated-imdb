A movie / documentary on different people in Austria at the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are doing. The pace is very quiet ...... so you must relax ....... breathing in ... even before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> first you think .... but nothing happens and you get a little upset about that .. and that's the problem, because its attitudes to the movie and really beautiful social realistic are the beautiful pictures of this movie ... ... ... a lot of people are saying it is disgusting ...... but it's not that bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are really moments really funny ... a 60 old woman stripping ..... i guarantee its the most insect striptease in movie history ...... its movie is real .. i think the word .... .. right up to your face .... .... and make it a bit scary of computer manipulation here ..... its real life ... and as we all know movies can have on reality when it's do things sick ...... .... so it's worse in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie you can start looking at your neighbors and thinking ... maybe they are like people in her movie ... i bet there are lots of out there ...... sick ... fool people living with a beautiful facade ........ after film sings I feel more exciting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie on your first date .........
