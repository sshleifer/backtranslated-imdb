Famous words of home camaraderie Maroni Roman Maroni, which "lousy cork sucker" who spends the whole film not only as Johnny Dangerously rival, but clogs the English language as well. <br /> Another classic underrated that you can only find on the afternoon maternity or "late late late show", Johnny Dangerous is a terrific satirical hit on a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for her mother's medical care and put her brother to law school. br /> <br /> Yes there is a story but concern? A cast including Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner, and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next. There are many laughs in this set here. Like Aircraft, you have to pay attention or you will miss something. Highly recommended for anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
