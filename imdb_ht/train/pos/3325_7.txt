OK, I would not normally watch a movie brother Farrelly. I can not remember ever watching one. I also do not remember watching a movie by Jimmy Fallon. Well, I looked at taxi, but I said to repent and be forgiven for that mistake. But this movie was Drew Barrymore and I just think it's the cutest thing. I do not know what she is about, but I'm just smiling ever I watch her. It just captivates me that way. I mean I looked at Adam Sandler just to see him in 50 First Date. How sad is that? This was not the biggest baseball movie - it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad dog that hung on the only thing that never left him until he found something worth giving up for. It had a predictable finish, but there was plenty of roadway that made it worthwhile.
