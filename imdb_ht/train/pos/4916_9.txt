Persuaded to replace females fatal in this sensitive noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets fine performances of his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspicion and a combination of tight composition and stunning single shot chase shotgun scene. <br /> A man entering the country illegally dies after a card game. It seems that it has a form of bubonic disease so it remains critical not only to the assassins arrest but to find an imaccuracy of all people who have contact. Cities and health officials apply a secret plan rather than community alert for fear of culprits that will run the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist woke up against the clock forming an uncomfortable alliance as the state mandate staffed the contrary investigation styles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whatever the result, you still can find yourself the second puzzle of the action of the movie's protagonist. Richard Widmark as DrClint Reed and Paul Douglas as Warren Detector show short temperament and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barred Bel Geddis as Reed's wife has some good times and Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch to (sad more than humorous) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the surroundings of the New Orleans Waterfront impressive lensed by Cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostly as a small criminal time is thin and repulsive, but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as Blackie's Skeleton (Black Death?) Is simply outstanding. With Palance intensity slope dominate each scene it is in not only with enough threats but disturbing charm as well. In addition it shows a formidable athlete that allows for a continuous suspense, especially in the powerful final movie algorithm. <br /> <br /> The street panic is probably Kazan in the best movie by Brando. It's full of strains, suspense quite paced and edited. It is environmentally friendly to lend a sense of intensifying reality that allows Kazan's flexibility to show his visual style beyond the movie scene and panic he succeeds with aplomb.
