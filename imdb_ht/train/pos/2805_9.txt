Wow, I can not believe I was long waiting to see this movie. I just never got to look at it. The scheme has nothing to interest me. I do not know anything about football (soccer). I'm one of those foolish Americans with no signs. I never saw David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this movie at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> The truths said, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making the sky. What a fun movie. It's color and glamor. I had a grim jump on my face in the entire movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can not help but root for it. It is not surprising why the US television channel E.R took it. I have a new appreciation for American culture. These people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are stunningly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I've had to decipher some of the British slang and dialogue in their accents. I turned to the English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I'm sure hearing around the world is having trouble understanding the jargon constantly changing in American films as well. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. He has a great sport scheme like Rocky, with a strong sense of feminist ability for women. I look at her with my wife, sixteen year old niece, and we all love her. I highly recommend it.
