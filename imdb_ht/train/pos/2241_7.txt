Another comedy about a little bit of fighting in the jungle of the modern world (for the quarantine) global and eight native natives and hacking guides, this is a fine entry into the Ealing Cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual in the lead, as a minister of ministers leads to the disaster of the river when a nation is supposedly in charge of starting to attract the interest of the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead, Peter Sellers puts in one of his tolling performance as a corrupt politician and Uber-succinct Jan Le Mesurier to play against quality as a revolutionary rugged leader. Many of the funs were not all, especially the viewer; Maybe not in the head eagle in classic Ealing, but very high up.
