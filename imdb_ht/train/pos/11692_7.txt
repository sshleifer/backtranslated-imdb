I do not say that as a Chris Rock fan, I say this as a person who has had so much time to attend this movie and has been proven wrong. The first defect was to read everything-work-out to finish that everyone saw coming. The deeper number I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed to be false. Finally acting in this film was sub-par, with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I've seen past flaws and saw a solid comedy. In a top-up storyline, look heaven may wait rather, it's best. So, for all your Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE, you will enjoy out there. She has some good standing-up in this movie. <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
