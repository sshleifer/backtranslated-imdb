This was one of the best war cinemas I've seen because it focuses on the more characters then the real war. All of the cast does an excellent job and because most of them are unmistakably unrelated to doing everything looks more credible. The camera's camera is so great that it was the rhythm and correction. This movie will actually get you and cause the audience to care for the charcters.
