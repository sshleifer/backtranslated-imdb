A delightful unpretentiously sent by Romeo and Juliet. Approach with no other expectations than having a good time and you'll enjoy this one. A talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted car. Bad reviews were due to a snobbishness on treatment of Shakespeare. Some people feel that all films are "important" --- If you share those views, do not bother. The credits he "introduced" Angelina Jolie, which is not even close to being true, but it is astoundingly beautiful as the Juliet character and, as always, acts it is beautiful --- and, considering his age at the time, even dialect it is very good. Recruiting this classic and Italian family foliage in the catering business in New York results in great fun. Look at it in the right frame of mind and you'll laugh loudly.
