I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was controlled to avoid making Cuba Revolution as corrupt graphics as it was. Simply reciting a few statistics will not make it to the smaller people. Still, part one, which is almost entirely injected into the jungle, captures the feeling of this place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. It is clear Soderbergh does not look down upon these people, but it's also clear it will not plead the cases of 'yanquis' far removed from the past past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I read. In my knowledge, Castro was not the Soviet Union until all attempts to obtain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects it is right on, especially as the looting by the exporters as the island goes further rebellious control. The country's treasure left empty.
