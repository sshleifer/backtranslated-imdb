I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much out there ... The federal government has arranged to have a tracking device implanted in the jaw of a small-time thief to lure a more dangerous pirated / computer out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the FED's "volunteer" man must be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it seems to be a lot of fun getting into his head with him for a while. Alvin herself eventually proves herself to be more than a good-humor-passive or passive character when it shows that it's not as easy to manipulate as it may seem. Definitely worth a look.
