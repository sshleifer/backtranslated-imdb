Julie Waters is exceptional with Adrian Pasdar a revelation of a very warm, very real, and extraordinary entertaining look at the dysphoria sex hassle and transvestis treatment in an executive youth's life. In the heart of this film is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you.
