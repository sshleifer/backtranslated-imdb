I just watched this movie in my GCSE story. It was thrilling and it was a brilliant insight that actually came to Steve Biko during the time of the Apartheid law. How can anyone say that this movie was more boring or dull 2 ​​and a half hours of life I do not know because it was my cock at start to finish. It was great as Denzel Washington described it, and showed how he fought against Apartheid's law and found equal rights to black people. At a party Steve Biko tells our policeman as weak and human as you are, this is the show that he and all the black people in South Africa were different with the white. Donald Woods inspires me because he continues to believe in and does not believe entirely in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and went to wake the world. I greatly enjoyed this movie and recommended this to people. It helped me to see that racism is not right and that everyone is equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of a person's skin. n
