This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary." Hans, one of the greats in the band, shows his talent as this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "The King of the Bet $ 1," shows he's not in Kansas yet not always upping the legs. Kyle's Street is truly infected, and offers a little eye candy for the ladies as well (like Matt). Nose, while having the moments, did not do justice to the Mexican dance as it deserves. And last, we have our protagonist, Ed. It gives hope to all of us bumbling, stinging, gangly, pale people who are always looking for a special person. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed theaters, this is a must rent, as we all can relate to one of these Breakumentarions Spring.
