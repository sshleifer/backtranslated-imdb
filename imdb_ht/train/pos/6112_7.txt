He is first and foremost a flick of chick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular film has the addition of some nice sweet scene scenes, I do not think any wire was used or if they were not flattened out flush. It is not a very complicated film so it's easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, very simple, good chemistry between driving, and a fun look. I would love it if they made out the full potential of the girls seems to only cause it to be amazingly beautiful, but throughout the film they hold it to the kind of beautiful key. I would look it again ... with a girl.
