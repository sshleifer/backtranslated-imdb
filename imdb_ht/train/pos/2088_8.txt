From the top shelf of Classic Classic Books, this masterpiece story is written by Pearl Buck. The book like the movie is called "The Good Earth." He tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) a simple Chinese farmer who started his day with a trip to 'Great House' where he took a slave woman called Lu (Luise Rainer) and made his wife. Almost from the beginning, he begins to adapt to his goodness by saving a peach seed and planting it near his new home. Over the years, O-Lan has proved her worth to share her husband's work, problems and changing fortunes. Throughout the years, a family has grown and looked at the weather in both homes of hunger. Indeed, it's the lowest point in life that each discovers the value of company, loyalty and love. With their changing times, they grow their families both helping and threatening with friends and family, such as the Uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a sick with phony, but compassion is tolerated. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) to give advice and remind him of vulnerable and life-changing nature. The remarkable actor who makes the impressive appearance of this movie is Keye Luke who plays Elder Wang and Phillip Ahn's son, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is beautifully suited to the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
