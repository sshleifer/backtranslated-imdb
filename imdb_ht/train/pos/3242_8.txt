I saw this movie with my dad. I had to be very young, around 15. It was about Star Star an afternoon. Fim started a bit vaguely, but you could say thieves were gathering up for a note. It really takes a rhythm after the first half hour. All actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's in the ensemble, they just play that well together. I can watch this movie anytime.I think that is the relative sort of the plot and the characters are trying to cope with a very strange note. The jokes do not reach the subtle and extreme hands but at the same time making them hilarious. <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
