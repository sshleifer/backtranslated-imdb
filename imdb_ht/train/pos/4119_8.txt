Another demonstration of the Kurosawa genius, his first color film is a surreal unusual look at the tragic life of Tokyo's slum dwellers, essentially a series of half-pockets depicting several groups of people who also emerged from a dangerous existence of a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty city. Swinging from comedy tragedy and back, this movie shows how people deal with the worst kind of life they each in their own way, especially retreating to themselves and living in the world fantasy of self , remove emotionally from those around them or drown themselves in alcohol. Mixing kitchen-leaking realism and Kabuki-esque theater, Kurosawa's games expertly with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughter with equal saturation. A wonderful experience, dried.
