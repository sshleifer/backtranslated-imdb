Most people lack Hollywood points in concept. If a hero can encourage heroic deeds in your mind to a child, within the boundaries of the law then I approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage. At all times in conflict or war, the public and the government look for hero to decorate. The motion picture industry brings the hero's screen for identifying people - like Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage has been remembered by more than one generation as is the 'best of the best' before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All the people who follow Doc Savage are just part of the character, not the 'Bronze Man.'
