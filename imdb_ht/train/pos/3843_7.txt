The first time I saw this film in the theater at an alien movie festival, I thought it intriguing, fascinating, tenderly the bi-sexual artist. So many Europeans, so very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second look and can hardly keep in mind at that too much work writ of writer's writers and a religious persecution-religious persecution. Get an outlet! This guy is a freeloader, living in society. I suspect that the real reason it is to have these fantasy-nightmare about the "spiderwoman" is that her guilty complexity is kicking off after the year of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars (and beds) and aliens! Not only does it make the extraordinary amount (probably taxfree) spoiled for making history (sexually transmitted travel) but it is too cheap to pay for a hair cut, hence adding the beauty salon owner. Then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! But I also suspected that the world has changed significantly since this film was born. On a serious note it was fun to see some of John Bont's works and one of Paul Verhoeven's best films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much after all?
