In 1996 "Dalmatians 101", Cruella De Vil was arrested by London Metropolitan Police (God Blesses) to attempt to rob and kill 101 puppies - dalmatians. Everything covered in mud and grass, it spent the next 4 years of "tin can." Now, 4 years later, he, unfortunately, was released to the prison. I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So, in 2000, Disney decided to release an end to the successful live-action version of the classic film and is dubbed "102 Dalmatians." In it, there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think I should know this since this was only shown on TV lately), and the puppy had no spots !!!! ! Also, while Cruella (again playing by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better dress - was once again out of the puppies !!!!! <br /> I especially loved the song I'm sure everyone loves to sing the "atomic dog" from the 70s or so. And now, we hear a bit of it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is like a big movie that I keep asking - when they will have a "103 DALMATIANS ???" lol <br /> <br /> 10 stars
