I give ten out of ten in one of the best movies ever. Absolutely crushed, stunned and quiet by the whole picture, wonderful play by Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, plotting amazing ... Just look at yourself and hack up your courage to admit touching your soul, because it In strange, but there are all the answers you've ever been looking for ... the best, mr. Ritchie! THE ONLY ONE. Those who were looking for a simple fiftings and hooking keep screaming were disappointed. But there are so many films in Hollywood nowadays, you can not remember what it was about the next day you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly expect it possible to show such a clear picture and genius in my head, to all who looked at it. Absolutely unsurpassed, surprising, dazzling ... One can get the insight they watch this, I have no doubt about that. Actually, no words can express my admire ... I always wonder how it was possible to shoot like a movie after year of our garbage trash we've watched. Thanks in all, it's simply the best.
