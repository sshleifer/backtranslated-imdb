I can remember watching this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barber brothers". This movie is still great. An original aspect was that scene of battle very short. Be aware that the "frat brothers" are so good that they end up being attacked quickly! Plus, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes even a bar splash! <br /> Yes, the act is bad so that's not a ten, also the story line has received a lot of criticism. I think it is quite original. Not many movies in genre have the same line of original story, or colorful dialogue. <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
