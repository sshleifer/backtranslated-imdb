Even if there is no new episode, and it is rarely shown. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the young witch. I've never got to see the past episodes, but I want to know what happened in Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts disappear from the show for good? I'm sure the finish went to perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard he decides between Erin and Harvey on his wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And I can say Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad too old for me though. Melissa Joan Hart has its own sense of doubt that it adds to the show, but there are many little "stupid" things to show in how popular they come from nowhere and play songs and all the cast will cost, it's kind they are stupid. Plus the cat starts to really get lame, as the show continues, the jokes began to just get stupid, and the things that audio controls the "audience" would laugh at, I would think it was so people who, lame. Do not get me wrong, in some parts it was funny, but I think the show just its kind of "magic" is so talk as the show went on. I give kudos to all the cast though for trying, although that Sun Moon Frye Moon had no taste, and she was an amazed actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter, now that the show ended.
