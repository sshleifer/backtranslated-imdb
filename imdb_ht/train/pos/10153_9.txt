I keep this movie in a screening. It was very surprising to find a really sweet and fun story. Well Acting. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male prince was awsome. Very funny movie. Take the best place in New York. Did I want to go there. I just saw "You've got a mail" I thought "It was owing you was a better story." Fresher. <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family .. I think it will do well Hearing I've seen it and love it .. A definite recommendation!
