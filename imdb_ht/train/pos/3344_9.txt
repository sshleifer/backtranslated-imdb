I went to see fever layers with my mother, and I can say that we both loved it. He was not the comedy romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other, and blah blah blah ... You did not wait for climates to kiss first or finally they get together. It was more real, because you saw them in the relationship, rather than the movie all about to be getting together. People can actually relate to the movie, because it does not seem to be extraordinary circumstances, or impossible situations. It was really funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
