Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film to some children in the field of intomology and can always remember the excitement of children; they were spellbound! It's not just about the temples built and live in the "Castles of Clay," but also on the other animals that use the hills. There is a fantastic scene in which a Cobra fights a lizard to control during a colony of watch Mongolia. It is not only good for intraological classes, but also to teach about ecology since there are so many of the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the entire ecology of all the organisms that live in and around the hills. <br /> I wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others.
