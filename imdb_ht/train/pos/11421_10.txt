I do not know what the previous review was watching, but I guess that's the reviews, personal tastes. They were missing in this film was deep, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affected. Undercurrents of love hold because of submission to society, taboos in times and classes, race relationships were not in a very good state of equality, guilt, desires, hatred, confusion, very black emotional I thought, under the skin, or has to be submitted to the aire of it, a streaming film, not slowly as stated before, releasing yourself to the film's flow, emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their flaws, embarrassing inside, excellent and actually very cruel !
