Space camping is a very decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time. This movie was originally released on the time of the disaster craft, and that really put a hindrance on how popular it was. <br /> The scene where the craft shelves open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is ... on a TV ... it just looks averaging. I remember the scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were really up there. <br /> This should be a good movie to see on IMAX, but I'm sure that will never happen.
