I must admit the right to the head, not a big fan of "family" films these days. Most of them, IMHO, are feeling feelings. But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous movie from Pixar, is a lot of fun. Two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland (especially compared to the two driving leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. The animation looked very much, the humor, though age, was still good (I especially love the hopper line "If I have not promised mother about her death that I would not kill you, I would kill you!"), And actors They make voices, except for their drive, were all terrifying (Denis Leary made an animated movie; what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has the same ones new.
