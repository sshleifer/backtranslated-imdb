A great story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the way. When you think that this is Denzel Washington's ever movie that he himself will be direct, I must admit I was an uncertain tad, but should not be ..? But then again, he is a great actor and many complaints of years of experience, and the end result has turned out great. The story is said in a great way, to have you had difficulty during your childhood, with young adults, seeing yourself in such situations. So it hits you hard, letting you know you're not the only one to go to hell. In all, a touching story about a young man trying to do it in this f *** ed up the world. (The story is based on Life Fisher Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the writer of this movie) strongly recommended. 8/10
