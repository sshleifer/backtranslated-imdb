"Magic" is not too loud a word for this movie spell. You find yourself relaxing, and seeing others in a more benevolent light ... Any movie that has a civilized effect on viewers deserves serious attention. Rarely is we soaked in beauty like this. As if being not enough, it's funny. Performances, without exception, extraordinary, but special mention are made of Richardson Miranda, with the superb Josie Walker - both open like roses. <br /> <br /> Why is NOT this movie about DVD? It is worthy to live forever.
