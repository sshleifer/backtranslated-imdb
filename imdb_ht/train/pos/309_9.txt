Before I watch this TV movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad Life Lucille's ball really was. He also had great moments, but I did not realize how sad he was. This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well. I highly recomend it.
