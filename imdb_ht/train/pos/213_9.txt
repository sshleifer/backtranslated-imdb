Walter Matthieu and George Burns were a famous acts of comedy Vaudeville, Lewis and Clark, who had not spoken in more than 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and held a complaint ever since. These are the premises of this hilarious Neil Simon play made in a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in the prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can get today. Richard Benjamin shines as Mattha's nephew with silver. There are even old clips of the real stars of the golden era to get you through the groove of the movie, and character actor Fritz gardens begin it all off with a "pop." Rosetta LaNoire, who started from the 30s in theaters with Orson Welles and later Grandma on "Family Matters," is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with it (and maybe I was too serious and / or serious) is the pathway to Matthau treating Burns when they first meet. Granted, having a lot of cluttered resentment throughout the years, but some of the things he does have to be considered brudging or just complementing wrongful behaviors are taken into context. Also, I used to see Matthau acting in other movies, but not George Burns. And, bellowing Matthau tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a still funny movie to help and forget your problem, put in the "Sunshine Boys." They will lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slip it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to slip it."
