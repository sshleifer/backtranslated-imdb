I do not think anyone else Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung make movies on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said, I do not like this, his newest film, quite as much as 2001 his chief "Daily Troubles" (although it comes very close), which he is one of my favorite movie films. It's only because the narrative here is perhaps a little too elliptical for its own good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it on a degree beyond it needs to go and so the movie does Little toys and incomprehensibility, and a few key points point should be clarified somehow (as the main character goes to South Korea to get her heart transplant, instead of showing it all a sudden without any explanation where it is or why it is there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just an excuse for Denis to use his favorite actors (Character Beatrice Dalle in particular is a little distracted because you keep hoping he will have some meaning). Still, the film is incredibly absorbed and the cinematography is beyond amazing. He is definitely a chef in his own way. At least as good as Denis's most highly acclaimed "Beau Travail", if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point, better than Leos Carax. Also, I must admit that South Korean section really does "Lost in Translation" better than that movie itself (and I, unlike some, I'm a big fan of film as well).
