Tho 35 years old, Groove Tube looks very much like TV current today! Network niche specialties, a television show on drugs drug dealers called the dealers (Ala Weeds, and even preaches Cheech & Chong up in Smoke 1978), commercial beer beer (Butz beer, no less than boating beauty) The child's companion in the pants (shades of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase performs humorous slapstick (a Van Deportant Duo) a year before his first 1975s on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the sequence of scam openings that earn Groove Tube an initial X-rating, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move on Up" without thinking of naked hippies hitchhiking dancing ---- For movies just as drawn- style, watch TunnelVision, Kentucky movie film, Amazon women on the mood, Monty Python's Beyond Fisherman, Dynamite Chicken, and all Firesign's theater you know wrong.
