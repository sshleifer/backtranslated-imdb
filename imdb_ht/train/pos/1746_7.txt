Bela Lugosi has played one of her bold good guys in a series of long-running running runs (which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cut a fine and sad sad face. that he did not find more roles where he could be the guy in order in a great way. Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help Nadji in Princess who is being hunted by the leaders of cult of Ubasti who needs him to carry out the death of the high priest of the cult. This is a good looking globe trotting series that is a great deal of fun. To be sure the rhythm is a bit sluggish, more analogous to one of the Directors (productivity product) features then a roaring adventure roar, but it's still enjoyable. This plays better than the feature films of being cut out of it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling running or having a sense that "hey i missed something". One of the trilogy in three good Lugosi series was made, others were SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
