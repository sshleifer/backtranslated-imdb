If there's one genre that I've never been a fan, it's the biopic. Still misleading, filled with fake information, over-dramatized scenes, and cheats all around, biopic are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the director talented as Martin Scorsese (the Flyer) and Ron Howard (a nice idea), they often make a big mistake to the people they are trying to take on the screen. Skepticism takes place in hype and the biopsy majority that makes their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was not different. Some criticisms and movies have had to Gretchen Mol give the Bettie Page's role, saying he was not yet a celebrity and did not have the chops for the party. I never doubt that Mol can handle the party since, but I never expected to blow as far as her performance as I was about to watch the movie these hours ago. Mol deliver a knockback Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s punishment girl, who, after an early life of abuse (show subtlety and nicely done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently become one of the most talked on pattern at all times. The picture covers a lot of grounds of 90 minutes long running again despite not less than three subplots, still having a feeling that may have a small portion of the story. Principal / co-writer Marye Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantastic script is only branded by a highly branched and not as clear as it should end. Still, credit must provide two ladies to create an almost parallel biopsy that has managed to pay tribute to both its subjects and the decade to emulate mastery. Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be nominated. Doubt it will happen, though there are certainly no three women worthy of them. 9/10
