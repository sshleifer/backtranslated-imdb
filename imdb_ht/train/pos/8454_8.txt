Second alternative Gundam Universe story (G-Gundam was the first), Gundam Wing is yet another different look in the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found, but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts. The biggest Gundams being nothing more than terrorists are fighting one lone organization. In truth, the series does not really become a show of wars until Episode 7 but in real-world conflict, the Eve wars, does not happen until the episodes later. <br /> <br /> The most positives in this series are her character. All the main characters live throughout the 49 episode run and you can truly sympathize with each of the roles set in. Another great feature is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The drawings put some of it to Gundam other tokens are disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest critics in this series is how many dead UC fans claim RIP off of the original UC legend. Why Gundam Wing Wins This Closer Closer The Closer UC Clarification of Gundam Seeds is outside there beyond me. True there are plenty of awakening times, but they say in new ways and there are different distinctions too. <br /> Take for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more outcast in the Alliance and in the way of OZ as well, while the Red House has brilliant Zeon symbol. Another great difference is the fact that Zechs lost a lot of soldiers under his orders as the other nickname he gave in the early episodes: "Assassin of his own person." Char is not given this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the mumbo philosophy of the jumbo but two problems. The first is the animated footage of the Gundams attacks. Be sure to read great weapons tank attacks, MS, and airplane first. But on it is fourth re-use scenes like this get old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the entire series is expected to take place for a whole year. If you really think about all the spring events in the series, a lot happens in just one year lone. <br /> But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the first line of the entwro each so often. As it ranks, this is probably the best of the Gundam universe universe contexts and a great introduction to the Gundam world. After all, this was highly animated Gundam animated in air in the US television.
