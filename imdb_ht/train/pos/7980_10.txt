Man on fire tells a story of a former ex-boyfriend who has a drinking problem accepting a job as a personal guard of a girl in Mexico during kidnapping waves for ransom. At first it's not friendly, but then they treat friends with each other, it decides to stop drinking etc., etc. ... then one day he gets kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> And He, will not stop at anything to get the revenge. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story of Fire Man but expecting some great twists at least a few times including the finish that is beautiful and will probably make you cry. This is also because of the great music of Harry-Gregson Williams and Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed. <br /> But the most part of the film ... wait .. .. The thing is, everything here is perfect. <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington is at her best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken quite well, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING to Dakota Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... then gets the cinema that is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have an Oscar for sure. is ... not just a movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think ... and it's more beautiful. Really. <br /> This is one of these movies you need to see in your life, at least once!
