I felt compelled to write a review for Cobra space as it received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people toward this old and especially forgotten Anime movie. Space Cobra is the funky story of a rogue and naughty smoker who gets involved with the three sisters of an ancient planet and dies with an evil force that wants to harness the planet powers. This is an old movie and the animation show, but that it lacks in its sophisticated modern make up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. Some if any references to Japanese and Great Japanese culture are great for Anime reviews to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra itself is witty and likable. I can not say how much of this is due to the English English or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very sixty barbarellish with a fantastic band by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and has constant action to move the story together. The unusual aspect of this film is how it starts as a comedy and ends on a very dramatic downbeat note. I can not think of another Anime or movie that could make this transparency and compelling. You barely realize that it happens, but it is so subtle and it looks perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and their lives were changed by the whole experience. Check if you can.
