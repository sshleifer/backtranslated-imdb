This is one of those who feels good, Saturday afternoon cinema. It's right up there with other retro cops like the flight of the Navigator. Just a nice movie and some subtle comedies lighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> I personally really love movies like this from time to time. There is nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I never knew Mr Phoenix I had just read the credits. It was just a baby really when she made this movie. Kelly Preston was quite young buddhist actress then too. She and Lea did a wonderful thing in this movie. I agree it's not an Oscar caliber movie. But much worth looking. Especially if you have the child, let's say, 8 to 11 year old rows. Or those interested in the space program.
