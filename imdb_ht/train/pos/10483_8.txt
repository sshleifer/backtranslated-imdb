Yes this film is predictable and definitely not premium-material. But then he does not try to be anything he does not. A fun-filled movie with real-world comedy One-Materio, a stellar performance and extremely funny by Peter O'Toole, a bart and down on earth performance from Joan Plowright. The band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a nimble, funny way. The music was good if not great but filling the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtleties of some of the humor went on top of them. A good example is to comment on "unusual baseball - like the game", my dear American, cricket - from which baseball is derived - and explaining to it in the U.S. unidentified band was very funny for those who know cricket . Also no, you did not assume wince when Carl broke a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "Oh wi!" to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also refers to the money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must explain some people ... All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some big laughs! Well worth seeing.
