"Panic" is the kind of a comedy crime comedian and William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in their leading role. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people to live. But for this moment she was facing a depression and that's why she sees a therapist. That's where she meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and she fell in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to leave the family business (killings), but he is not now how to say this to his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a guy while he's midlife-crisis, facing regular problems: falling in love with a beautiful girl and everything that goes with that. <br /> <br /> Pretty good performance act by throwing. Macy is excellent as Alex's depressed. I had great hope for this one and it was a good movie but it was not completely saved. The story was rather flat and clich√© .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
