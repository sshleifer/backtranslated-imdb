Everything I remember about it was excellent ... great cast with Sam Waterston & George Innes (before becoming more accustomed to US audience) .... excellent scripts as only the English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Type of cannery, but with a twin Jules Verne. The sort of like MacGyver would have been in England 80 years earlier ... right at the beginning of scientific / technological revolution in the 20th century. <br /> I was often asked if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver first revealed about 3 years later. <br /> I always have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape.
