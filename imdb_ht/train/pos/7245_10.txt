This is just the full-length feature film on the world of bridges. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but then the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how to go about earning a living. <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think that a non-bridal player would get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really nice, the mercy of the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The media route described is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridges will never be like that. <br /> <br /> Look it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.
