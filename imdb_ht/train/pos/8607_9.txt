Never understand why MacDonald-Eddy singing in Swan has always been panned so gracious - not just by the opponents, but by virtually everyone. For me, "I am an angel" is more alive and imaginative than any of the more outdoors celebrating trips. Their compositions and costumes are as priceless as any could be found in a MGM music, the script is not the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco," the "Women," "Mr. Blonde," etc.), Rodgers and Hart Melody (well-trained somewhat by MacDonald-Eddy Trimmer Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) has provided celestial treatments by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner of the "Wizard of Oz"), and best of all, the "sweethearts singing "look great in their contemporary clothes and seems to have fun and the bizarre procedures. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" of today uninitiated and may very well have a hard time sitting still, but this cut, fast-paced fantasy is tied to entertain.
