I liked the night listening to the lot. It's one of the best movies in the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of her best performances. In fact, the entire disposal was pretty good. All played just the right notes for the characters - not too much and not too small. Sandra Oh adds a nice funny touch. Toni Collette is great as the mother, and never goes on top. Everyone is very credible. <br /> It's a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images have been cut off from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and he did in simple mode, which is a refreshing change from many directors who seem to think work is to impress the audience rather than telling a story and saying read well. <br /> You do not need to be stunned by forecasts and ads. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. Watch the overnight because you want to see a good story said well. If you go to Hitchcock you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> More than I and the movie ended. The director has left a little more of the audience's imagination, but this is a minor chess.
