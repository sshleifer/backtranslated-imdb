Those French and German Germans are sure to have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Fellow of translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would confront Germany and start its plan to take over the world, France being an accident at his ambitions. But these are the sereneness time compared to the future. A minor group at the border tries to cross France for work. They come back and later in a nightclub in French neighbors. Then a disaster came to the mines in the French with a well-crafted and written scene, a German Minor troops decided to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet to silent movies and I'm not sure if this movie is his first sound or not, but his poetry has to be discovered. It's not whimper but brings a realistic realism in the ordeal. Still there is even a flashback at a WWII event that will point out points in this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie makes the events proud and directly with strip. Sometimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
