As romantic comedy goes, this was a nice and winning one. I thought the writing could be strong to build the final connection somewhat better, but that's not a great tripping point. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf provide beautiful performances, and they are as good as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. I hope to see them throw in more projects soon. <br /> In general, this movie will not change your life, but it's sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.
