This movie is very good krackles and tension. The feet, of course, high - will be the police and widmark, the public health doctor, arrested the criminals who do not know that they are carrying diseases before a full-scale epidemic breaking out? But smaller elements traced to present tension in each scene - between widmark and the commander of the police, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a deceased personality that Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because it There are smuggling of some valuable commodities, between Widmark and his wife, and the underlying question whether the public is best served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic. The film is very well shot by Kazan, in extraordinary well-choreographed shot taken sideways in New Orleans, and ends at a stunning point, where Palans runs like a rats from his buttocks, at the pier and storage of the city. The comment is superb, probably the best that I've heard, covering the cinematography, framing and lighting of the shots, drawing production, filed by non-professional actors in small roles, and the irony and parallelism of the plot, as a insightful seminars on 1950 film techniques and film noir generally. Watch it once to enjoy the movie on its own and, if you are interested in movie-making, the second time and the comment they learn.
