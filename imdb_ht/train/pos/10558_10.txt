<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman made strange popular metaphysics, but this Canadian goalkeeper made it hilarious. <br /> Like the most unusual movie less said about the best draw, but let's put the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave were together since childhood, they can not cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have. But there are even more problems to start. <br /> I liked this movie, it made me smile long after the final credit and that's a rare experience and lots of mass produced pieces of "nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> Do not miss that. <br /> <br />
