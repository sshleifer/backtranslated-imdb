I missed almost all the first quarter, but when other shows were going to reruns, I started watching. I ended up buying the first quarter of iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His sense of humor was my rolling all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I enjoy members casting more (but it does not say that it does not add to the show). <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you do not check this out, give it a try. If you can catch the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you will see how good this show is. <br /> I hope this series has a long run.
