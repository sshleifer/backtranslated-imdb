David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, well) is a lawyer, more adept at touching corporate taxation (.. and suffering from strange dreams that disturbed him to see the aboriginal man dressed in darkness), who called on to take a case About a group of aborigines packed with the murder of one of their own Billy was calling it that he was trying to steal stones and painting ceremonies on them and killed when a leader of an Aboriginal tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula ) uses a "death bone" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, revolving around David, the bad weather effects of Sydney such as rain beat down polluted dust and rock-sized hills during bright blue skies (with no sights in the clouds, as the one who hit a central school Australia), not to mention, a rainbow "deformation" that is split (!) In groups. As David pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the strange events taking place than he could ever achieve. An aborigine called Chris (David Gulpilil) appeared in front of him in a dream that caught a stone and blood and found that this man is one of those he is represented in trial! He finds it very possible, after some strange meetings with Charlie and conversation with Chris, that he can very well be linked to a spirit named Mulkurul and that his dream is the actual prevention of possible horror yet to come. /> Absorption dramatic apocalyptic builds its methodical method and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is visually apprehended as we see these images are very overwhelming in possible bankruptcy towards civilization, but the most compelling angle of the movie is certainly David's travel to find that the monumental truths of his plagues, Charlie's question with Chris countless, at first helping his people get off from a crime they did not commit, and finally found out what he did with catastrophic anything that happened or could happen later.
