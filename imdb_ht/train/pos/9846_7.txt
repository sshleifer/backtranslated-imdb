Ok, at the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - the loner who is persistently followed by the funny rescue. Then it evolves into something that is truly compelling, as the gantle is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, with moments that I agree that they are a bit too dramatic for kids to look (than Manny, for example). The quote was obviously worked for a long time, so they could be suceed in making a series of films and almost no different sets (ice helmet only with stone), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be worn-jerking at some times, so the children must warn. The real sad is the animation. This was not so souped up as the game story cinema or Shrek, and it shows. People are unrealistic, and we've seen best examples of CGI before. But do not let this spot the file: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is laudable. And he will gather lots of fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, moments and little mouse are priceless, and show-robbers.
