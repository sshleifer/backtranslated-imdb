This was a very enjoyable movie. A humorous, but impressing look at family, and the obligations that come with it. The story of a man who comes home from his life in the city where his father baths in a Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, even taking care of so many things he has left home to get away. The movie is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
