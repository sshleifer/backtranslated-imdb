Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film in the same name, this is a stylish look at Hong Kong's triangular gang. Calling elections because a new leader or 'president' is elected by ancient tradition every two years. The two candidates up for the position and in months, bribes and track records past the race are the tensions to say at least. Experts have led to introducing you to an expansive cast without ever blurring the torsion history and turning before revealing itself to its brutal glory. Asian godfather is not, but it is an enjoyable thriller of a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing in the violence. Volume Subtitled 1 I think it's safe to say there will be other installments as we go deeper into the noble world of the triads and deals with feuding and business ash. Either way this is a good start and if there is no end to a big movie in its own right.
