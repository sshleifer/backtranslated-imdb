I just looked at the "Last Wave" in my school library. It's intriguing, like Peter Weir's stuff, but it's not always as careful-keeping as I would like. I found myself fascinated by the ideas that they had thrown at me (because they were very well occupied by the film director Weir) but at the same time I was not encouraged enough by them. AKA I got a bit bored of spots. The plot surrounds an Aussie Lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has that links to a group of Aborigone he is defending. It starts out with an intense time sequence and has some awesome atmosphere at all (most notably the "belching" sound design) and strong direction; but it just did not entertain me as Later weir's movie does. I might just need to look it over though. <br /> <br /> Good movie about mania and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery existing between the white and the Aboriginies offers some very serious consequences. But God blesses Peter Weir, though. For her alone this film is worth watching ... very organic director. Like a Aussie Malick answer! I would give it a 7 because it had enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.
