This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet, its appearance in a theater game transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A single chef should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not armed). At a busy road in Belgrade's capital, a war exposure has decided to pass the passenger behavior. Two Gypsy singers sing in miserable lives but also predict a tragedy; The songs both divide and connect the stage of this extraordinary road movie (real life brother fees are amateur actors, but along with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmers in the road worker provide a real life performance). The character gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into the collective people of the nation: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin, but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hope ignorance could prevent the tragedy. Using a simple movie language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by wars (World War I), but also emphasizes personal portraits and successes: a singer's provocative, inexperience of newlyweds, gravity of veterans in the Great War who is about to visit him lately conscripted his son, with gloomy predictions from a man who seems to have a German spy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The brighter-sweet commercial directors will define Serbian movie cinema in the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od odiota", and my other favorite director, "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
