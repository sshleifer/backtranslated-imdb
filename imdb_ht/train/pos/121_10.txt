Critics need to review these classes as a quality movie. I think critics have seen too much movie action and had succumbed to the Matrix style of film. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film and many layers that one look is not enough to understand or appreciate this exceptional movie. Lars von Trier shows that old films in filming can produce wonderful movies and build drama and tension. Project effects of the projection used during film excite and enhance the characters, and the focus of the conversation they have. Other effects it uses as the color with black and white in one such scene as Hitchcock and the girl and the red dress attracts attention and improves the drama and meaning of the scene. The next is superb and has a hypnotic effect, yet keep focus on the central character of the stage and action. <br /> I could talk about the more effects, but I think you all would agree to push this movie into a category of its own, and really heighten the drama in the movie. A movie to buy if you do not already have one and one to see if you do not have it. <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this noir movie from one of the great movie directors.
