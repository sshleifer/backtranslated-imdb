After being forced to sit in some real stinkers (racing strips, shark girls and lava girls) - I really like watching "Fried Worms". For once, I did not guess the finish! It was funny and fun and did not resort to a ton of gross-out humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both love him too - oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face ever. This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for parents. The relationship with the younger brother is so close to real life. "It does not stop singing just annoy me !!" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how these friends actually form is right-on and how the kids behave. Of course, parents have to act a small jump - but my favorite scene involves the dad getting used to his new job. Have fun!
