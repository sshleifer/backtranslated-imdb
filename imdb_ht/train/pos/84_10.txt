I used this movie in a religion class I taught. The golden fish is swimming happily in her bowl in an upper floor apartment. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy gave money to buy milk. On the way home, it stops at carnival to play a game. Next he stands a man in a black suit looking a little frightening. The boy drops the bottle of milk. It breaks down. The man in black suit gives him the money to replace the milk. This scene is replaced with what is happening at home. A black cat rises escape fire and enters the apartment. Read (?) Discover the fish bowl and watch it. The energetic swim fish and flips from the bowl. From now on, a bunch of adolescents in my classroom and I have fallen in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish in the bowl. The dual story line includes the suspect man in black and suspects the black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a great starter discussion in my classroom.
