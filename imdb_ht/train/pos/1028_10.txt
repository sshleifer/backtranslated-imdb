I said, from the beginning, when I watched the movie stargate I was not hauling or anything it was like a movie film average, and a lot of potential, even though the movie did not like, erm, amazing like other star scenes such as star or alien stars, which if you are a fan monitoring you will admit one of the two amazing titles, though I'm not like hardcore scene fans like some people, I do not remember a line from either In those movies, I'm not a big fan wearing star wars shirt, in fact if you saw me I would look like an average person of you, ah getting a little bit of point here, well my point is that you do not have to be a tough basic craft subject to love this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing season with no drop in its quality as it came closer to its end 2006. <br/> <br /> though I did not like the very movie I was well looking forward to the first quarter of 1997 and left me telling you, the special effects were just one of br things that were sick on the series, the chemistry between the characters just blown me away to the special, they were as good if it's not better than most sci fi show running today a. I must admit that I never went to Sci fi if it was not for Stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into Sci fi when I was like 6, and I'm glad she did, other wise I would not have seen the brilliant shows like SG1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly series of girls and movies, basically if a new set of SCi girls is not better or as good as SG1 , it's not worth watching. Basically this is the best Sci show date, and if you do not watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!
