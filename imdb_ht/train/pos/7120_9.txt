Most film wars in the United States during the WWII were great fun to watch but suffer from serious gaps in realism because they produce more for propaganda value to increase the spirits of home than anything else. I do not hit the movies as many of them are still very watchful. However, because they often lack the realism to prevent them being really great movie. A perfect example was John Garfield's film John Garfield - in which a B-17 almost one-handedly took out half the Japanese force! However, the navy pride is a welcome departure - scoring high to show a true story in a reasonably accurate way. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not a true story as it looked like too bad to be true. However, after researching more I found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two people who did a lot to earn Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
