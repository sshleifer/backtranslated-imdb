I liked to show this growing and I always watch the first DVD season at age 19 today. What's wrong? I grew up in a home much like the one on Complete House. I had a father, two sisters, and a dog. I guess the difference was only that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Also, I grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I would do without full house on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's Candace sister), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) is my favorite character. I can relate to each of them because I'm a child among my family like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values ​​because I do not really like any of the O.C.-love shows today. I love the comedy of Full House, too. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier), and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girl's uncle, dad's father, and dad, respectively. The story goes that, after the mom's mother dies, Danny's best friend Daney and her brother-in-law, Jesse moved to help raise the kids. Three men trying to raise three girls = hilarious. Each character on House House is full of hearts, comics, and genuine believers. Joey is an aspiring comedy with the heart of a child and soul. Jesse is cool, riding motorcycle, uncle-guy uncle who is softened by his three holes, and later, Becky, his wife (Laurie Laughlin, from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
