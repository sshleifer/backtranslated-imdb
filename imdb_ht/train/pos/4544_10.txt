Well, I know I would not like this movie, but I do. From Morit's romantic interpretation to a Japanese stereotype of Jay Leno, I laughed at all this film. As long as you take into account that this is not the best film in the world, it's a good mvie. /> My favorite part is Morita talking to her boss in Tokyo and drinking a second close.
