Well, maybe not immediately before the riots Rodney, but even a few months before was timely enough. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police being accused of LA being burned to the ground. She just goes to show the state of race in America. The plot has Mack White (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) to become friends after Simon rescued Mack's life in black ghetto. Meanwhile, Davis producer movie (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that free violence is really cool ... until it gets injected. There are also some existentialism in the movie: Mack and his family come to realize that they are not as they really want. <br /> It seems that "accident" has somewhat renewed human interest in race relationships, but this one comes out earlier. Perhaps we can never have stable race relationships in this country. But either way, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. He affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also begins Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
