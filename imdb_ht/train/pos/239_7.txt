I watched this movie with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time especially because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> I do not know if the events are said to be true, or if it is all fictional. But the road Ned Kelly is described as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. I do not think he was described as a criminal or stealing redneck, but this is just my opinion. This is a solid Western-style film for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is great as always with the sexy Naomi Watts charm screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it's broadcast on the cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
