A hot-headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers the crime, but must deal with a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney are meeting with Preminger director in a noir movie that is effective as "Laura," their earliest collaboration. Andrews is perfectly cast as the serious cop, a good guy holds up in unfortunate circumstances. The act is good all around, including Malden as a tough police commander and Tully as Tierney's Protector. Scenario by Hecht, a prolific and prolific senarist, is stiff and thrilling, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
