William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of family business without angry unplanned parents. Widespread in the same territory as the TV "Sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis in a criminal term (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching in some steady directions from Brommel (I watch forward to that guy next to next), an excellent script, and all around great performance. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is at his best climb as the dominant father. Tracy Ullman gives an amazing dark turn dramatic as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines ad-libbed and wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman captures Macy's eyes. All of this is punctuated by a moving note and dry pace that leads up to a Biggest Evaluation but still powerful and significant and touching consequences. This movie deserves a wider release, as I suspect it would have to connect with audiences.
