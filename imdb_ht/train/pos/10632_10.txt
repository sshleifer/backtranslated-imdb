This is a movie for entertainment; I did not think the world made social commentary from one small film. I personally get this movie funny, audacious, and memorable. It's a fantasy not unlike a girl girl gets a princess. This film was done very well I could add, in the 70's at a time of the best experiences in films and being able to mention someone's sexuality. This film is not about someone who was homosexual or not, it is however about love, all of it in strange form. This film shows some of the facts of being gay in the 70's in Hollywood, or in California. The prettiest boys looked after they were not so handsome. Women who live in the valley close to the emotional closet or risk do not have a career. Bathing was an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> And then the fantasy begins! Should we mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what we have? Well this movie, which in any way was much better than that of the participant's "Next Biggest" tune. Perhaps someone should ask the crew everyone to see this movie and try to do better. <br /> I loved this movie when I saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my mouth right now. I'm tired to advise anyone who wants a funny, sensitive movie - boil up with some popcorn and have some fun. Some people need to brighten up !!! And this is the movie you should do it with! <br /> <br />
