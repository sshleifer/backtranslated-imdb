I got to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary on a journey on an ancient vessel across the vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl has developed a theory that the ancient anchors of Peru manage to travel thousands of miles across the Polynesia Sea, based on certain ranges that are found in both places, certain types of ancient vessels that will be known as being available, Analysis of sea and wind streams, and the knowledge that Enka has done, in fact, travels to some amount of money determined by sea. <br /> <br /> In order to test its hypotheses, Heyerdahl and his crew construct a container as well as possible from what the ancient anchors were available, using only wood balsa and other available materials at the time, and set out to Peru's capital, Lima, to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, some 5,000 miles away. <br /> <Its theory, as much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the protection of travels provides for strong support that it is right. The film is really little more than footnote taken during the 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like with the trials and tribulations that they faced. I often hope that Academy Awards documentaries have been easier to find, and this one out of over 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I'm sure it was when it was first released.
