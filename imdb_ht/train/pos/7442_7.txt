I rented the movie (I do not think he got a theater release here) out of the worst. Preview made the movie look horrible. I was in fact very surprised, it was well worth seeing; It was scripted wounds, almost like a piece of film ensemble. It has some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show with the people on the show without too much scouts. It is defective, especially by the awesome soundtrack of 'comedy' bludgeoning effect on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true in the form of shows in an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way. His time is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer, it is also an easy target. Springer was able to make Kane's citizens and he would proclaim the 'worst movie ever'. I recommend this movie to anybody interested in the show. A tricky but innovative and exciting piece of film.
