This movie was excellent. A sad truth is how culture tends to conflict with sex. This is just one great high quality fuzzy in film. You have the masters that are stiffer in tradition and kind of interesting in her own way, Doggie despite being something girl to win her affection and you yourself cut off with one beautiful monkey and a facial expression. That's up to the big movie happy at the end. This film does a great job of showing how stiffness of one tradition can be, so the seals that they want to die without sharing their secrets. You see where in a culture has never seen before helping to improve the drama that unfolds near the end of the photo. The cinema photography is excellent, in particular the open parade sequence and all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar discussion for best movie alien.
