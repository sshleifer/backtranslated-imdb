IN Cold Blood must be classified as the first-rate film-making, though the subject is over as ugly as it gets into the world of make-believe, but film noir fans should definitely get this one a gripping piece in Work, based on it is on a true-life crime island. It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and truly dramatic views of a bus title heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the movie even before finishing their credit. B & W photography at Conrad Hall does a superb job right from the start. <br /> <br /> Also clear from the start: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT WILSON are natural actors born. They do a good job of free amiable friendship friends looking for the next thrill. "Ever see a millionaire frenzy in the electric hair? Hell does not have two types of rules in this world. One for the rich and one for the poor," says Wilson, taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel. > <br /> Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family, showing no mercy and leaving no witness behind. <br /> <br /> Blake, reminiscent of movies, and thinking of hunting for gold in Mexico, said: "Remember the 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' Bogart? (An ironic moment, because Blake himself was in the movie as a ticket sold lottery ticket). "I got you set for a natural born killer," Wilson says Blake. JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the lead detectives on the case, discovering that all four family members were tied, shot in the head and one had to cut off her throat. "Do not people around here shut up?" ask PAUL STEWART. "They will be tonight," the answer is terse. <br /> <br /> After the killers, the killers discovered that there was "no big fat safely in the wall", as the prison informant told them. So, in the end, it was really a stupid, unreasonable crime. The question is: WHY did it? And this is a second half of the film exploring in depth. It takes an hour and a half of the movie before the detectors catch up with the killer and begin the interrogation. <br /> It's the final scene that brings the most conviction and interest as most boys have said they did many mistakes and left a living witness. The current events up to and including the murder are saved until the end. "It makes no sense," Blake said Forsythe. "Mr. Knife was a very nice gentleman. I thought so until the time I cut her throat." Scenario by Richard Brooks is short and at the point - and so is his direction. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Brilliant illustration of two young teenagers on a crime indulgence that made no sense then or now for only $ 43.
