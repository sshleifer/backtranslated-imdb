Awesome actors, beautiful scenery, solid reality. I will not elaborate on all the other comments' because you get the picture! However, the movie is not for the rush. Fact is killing pigs and other animals in order to survive. I also had Randall Stewart's homestay book. I read it several years ago, I have to re-read, since I just looked at the recently released, remastered DVD to the movie. <br /> I tried to buy the video for many years, finally bought it used out of a video store from business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I purchased it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but well worth it to me. This is a movie I'll watch until the end of my day!
