[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> I have this adult friend for the notion that his parents have sex makes it very uncomfortable. It came to mind when I reflected on the reaction of the "Mother." People who gasped on May (Anne Reid) were enthusiastic in bed with his younger lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexual explicit designs by May. I do not doubt the audience was aghast in the stripping or content designs as much as feeling comfortable in seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Lovely Laundrette," "My Son Of The Fame") again proves why it is among the most trekking stories on each side of the Atlantic. Her story is not easy to take. This searing family drama is not a movie you can claim to enjoy watching because it's raw, complex, and often makes us very comfortable. But it's a good thing. Kureishi and Roger Michell (directing "Notting Hill," in all of this) craft a sensational, wrenching and superbly acted portrait of an older woman who accomplished, after all these years, she can and should always enjoy all in the fun of life. At a nice moment, when her son Bobby asked her not to be tough, can shoot back, "Why not?" <br /> Why not, indeed. <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. See Reid when I observe Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch of a pub. Or, when asked Paula to open the front door after a disaster. Reid's eye and face reveal all the mourning and despair. At the most devastating film time, May drops on her knees before Darren, wanting to do anything for her, only asking her to be kind. This is a very good performance of a remarkable actress. <br /> I loved using Michell in natural sounds, especially when Me and Toots first came to Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrates cacophony in all of May and toots, the flippant way in which their own families receive them. <br /> <br /> This movie, at times, reminds me of the honesty and practice of Mike Leigh's work, except "Mother" hanging on a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat. <br /> <br /> One My Riddle: Michell's decision to give first and Darren's favorite scenes a pretty cheesy sensibility. The lovers stay out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutter gently into the breeze. And the sole sound is in the heart of the poison of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who fully enclose the role of Darren, work as they are terrified by these unreliable roles to hide their almost primitive character's energy the audience. Especially since Michell has no crime on performing lateral sex scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have incredibly likable characters. We sympathize with May, but he, too, causes his daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended for his story and popular liking. His point, I believe, has demonstrated a family that is already cracked when something emotional catastrophic happens. It's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.
