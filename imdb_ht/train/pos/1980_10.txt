One of the last great musicals in the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this film, and it was always a favorite since then. Music numbers are all memorable. In the 60s the cast members of Musical Act currently had musical talent (unlike a award-winning Academy CERTAIN musical music award based in a large midwestern city). All the main roles were very well driven ... Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threat to Bill threats (which fortunately does not have any music numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester came across an innocent waist, which Dickens had intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course there are dozens of dancers who do "consider yourself," "I would do anything" "Who will buy" and "be back soon," many people were kids! This is a great show for the whole family.
