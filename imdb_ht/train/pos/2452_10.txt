It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally, bad stereo types are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show, and I just started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept on a Latin family TV show really surprised me. I'm surprised that finally Latinos has a good shot to be on TV. This show is probably the best one I've seen, it's funny, heartwarming, touching, and pretty.
