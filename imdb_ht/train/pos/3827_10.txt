I have no idea what the other critics are talking about- this was a wonderful movie, and creating a sense of the era that feels like time travel. Characters are really young, Mary is a strong match for Byron, Claire is juvenile with an annoying tear, Polidori is a competitor to beat-down Sycopane ... all are beautiful, curious, and decadent ... not debris in Gothic. <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and I loved it for different reasons, but this works as a merchant and ivory movie, and it came from reading I captured at best in what summer felt like. Romantic, yes, but completely reintring my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the movie. One of my all-time favorites.
