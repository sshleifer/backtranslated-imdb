But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang hangs second by one as a battalion, only Sammo Hung in better comparison. This is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of techniques - Rather than flashy camera angles etc. - during battle. The direction is closely monitored not only by excite the viewer by the speed and movement, but its seizure and exactness appear. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance in the scene performed with which the open movie is one of the highlights of kung fu film history. Liu was supported by the handsome and talented Hui Ying Hung (in my renowned Young Auntie) and 'Hsiao Hou' who have the grandiose acrobatics, and preferable to any amount of wires. As for the scheme, this film follows the theme Not common in revenge, but with character and moral development on the road, with a most fitting resolution. The humor of this is also the best. If you only watch one kung fu movie ever, this would be a good choice - it has it all.
