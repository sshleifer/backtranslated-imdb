Colman's performance is assisted by the brilliant script writing. Gigantics Hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the German film editions and incorporate them into Hollywood films. Very good use of shade and light and silhouettes. I really liked the scene where Colman turned on the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the movie, and he began to recite Othello while his face became instantly dark and wrong. already the viewer saw the text and drama in Shakespeare getting a hold of "Tony" and cut it off on his travels into bankruptcy. I also enjoy the dramatic drama scene in the play, when it gets overwrought with emotions and accidentally strangles it's a little too hard to bear. complaining "sting your tone is hurting me" are chilling and suspense. you just do not know if he will go over the head and kill him at any moment. The cat and mouse chase reveal the killer was nicely added 2/3 in the way to the movie to add some rhythm faster and add to the narrative element of the movie. Mastery work from George Cukor. He is like skillful director. Excellent movie. Too bad are not done like they are used ...
