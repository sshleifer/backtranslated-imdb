I will not spoil the contents of anyone, who have not yet looked this modest masterpiece by Pollak Home. A world famous glossy conductor played by Michael Nyqvist is seeking peace of mind by moving back to his childhood. The villagers, who followed the genius in silence, slowly tempted him to share in his magnitude. <br /> <br /> Each role of this film has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential of each of the actors playing their own codes in short but accurate words, a symphony of love. <br /> Do not like in relationship sense, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried in each of the characters, each revealing their own story now, needs, skeletons, desires and more. <br /> I must not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas have played in unforgettable harmony of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected to their own self-esteem. Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it came from beginning to end, not one second less or more than enough, you stay with a feeling of change and a taste for more. At that time, definitely one of the best movies I had the pleasure of watching.
