I went to this wait not to love her; I figured it would be very worthy and reliable, and rather plodding and dull. <br /> It's actually far better than that, and I find myself really enjoying it. I do not know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most knows - to marry Albert, who died young, and she was sad all the time later. Seeing the circumstances it has grown under was fascinating; In fact I find myself wanting to see more of the story, and I imagine we can see an end at some point. Visually the movie is stunning. The compositions and costumes are incredibly rich without too much gaudy and on top. The act is toothache from all involved. <br /> In a word, it was great!
