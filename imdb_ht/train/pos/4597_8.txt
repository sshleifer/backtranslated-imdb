Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was pushed into the Spotlight once more and the 1983's Project, a flicking hugely flickering pirate that re-established her as a major star. Since Police History has released two years later, extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie has reached its zenith, and the crowd has gathered to see this frenetic mix of awesome demonstrations, brutal battle and skeptical scenes. He broke many box-office files and inspires a 50% increase in recruiting the police, but sees 20 years over - is it any good? <br /> As a movie action movie movie individually stands. There are several physical battle scenes, some stuntwork that recalls the best of Buster Keaton's hero warrior, and a compelling if over-violent tussle climate. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and also often fog in comedy hard work on the movie's impact just a little, charisma it brings it to. In addition, in presenting our hero as a bordline psychopath who has anxieties to put others in danger, Jackie has taken an important player ... though in any event event seems to have been noticed! Not praising Police History as a simple 'Good vs Evil' Critical Battle belittled the ambiguous movie of tones, and also it's hardly the Karamazov's Feel, describing the uncertainty of the movie anyway representing a remarkable change and chanting out of ideas conventional. > <br /> In short, this remains a quality "popcorn" movie * (even if you can empty your belly as many bandits are violating or filing in glass exhibit in the final movie scene) - a potent action, slingshot entertaining film that ranks with the best of its period.
