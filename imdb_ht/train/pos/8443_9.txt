My favorite police series ever turned into a TV-movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. The homicide "fame room" turned. Pembleton and almost all of the cops that have ever played in this series. A lot of flashlights help you who have not seen the TV series, but it also entertains fans. The last five minutes to solve another murder and the very end of the two cops dead up. And a short look from my favorite cardinal Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
