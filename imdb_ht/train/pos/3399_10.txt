This was Eddie Robinson's 101st film with his latest, and he died in cancer nine days after shooting was filed. Everyone who makes his key scene in the movie all the more intensely. Although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit date (also remember the video game shown in the movie), but the subject of the movie is pretty much timeless. Heston said he wanted to make the movie for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The act is top-notch, especially the interplay between Heston and Robinson, and beautiful performances by Cotten and Peters. . The medley of Beethoven, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky combine with the visual pastoral elements to make for some scenes really moving. This is the icing on the cake for the movie. The theme (or "point") of the movie is an important one. Yes, it is a movie about surpopulation, but on a more important note it is a precautionary story about what can go wrong with the Man's responsibility on Earth. It's the subtext that you get the real message of the movie. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and remember how Thorn is able to understand what Sol is saying. <br /> This movie is one of my top sci-fi films of all time.
