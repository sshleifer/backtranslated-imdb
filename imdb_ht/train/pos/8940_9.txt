This movie-based bio-based film is based on one of my most-hearted books I've ever read. She tells amazing stories of two sisters, both who have earned devotion and respect working well in their 70s as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the movie and performs perfectly its nuances as the rebel "beren" bessie, the dentist. He does not just express his anger, anguish, and wisdom; It lets you know exactly where they came from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has felt the sister's sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but I'm scared she never made me believe she is over 100. No matter - stories are quite worth saying. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and persistent in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the film as reporter in the NY NY Times. This, too, is only a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and although two or three get a little damaged in the translation, most of them make it's just fine. <br /> I recommend the book as essential for everyone I recommend to any book. I can not properly but this TV movie in rare air, but it certainly captures enough of the taste to be very refreshing in its own right.
