This film had terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics do not usually get "offbeat movie", I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately they were largely right in this example. <br /> <br /> The movie just has a left feel over it's most off. The sort of feeling that is impossible to describe, but not a good one. More things are confused, the script is something that is flying that is just vaguely interesting. The extremely talented Thurman just drifts in this disruption creates barely an impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the movie with enthusiastic performance, but nothing at the script. It may have been less embarrassing for them to simply pick up floats and get it on with Thurman. One thing "critical" movie criticisms were failing to mention however is that the movie is actually quite funny. Whether it has moments in accurate satire or awkward mocking moments as when the cowgirls in question chase behind Hurt on the hips and the center of bloodworn ... ahem ... end front. Chortles are still alive, while I would not recommend this movie, there are entertainment to be had and watch even Cowgirls Find Blues are worthwhile for something different.
