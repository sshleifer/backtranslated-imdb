This first season in this series of comedy was very strange and they were not very funny and there was a dramatic element where Bill (mother) was fighting with all the usual issues in life but this element was a bit depressing and did not mix well with comedy thth element which is probably why it fell. And he soon became one of the BBC's fake comedy series ever! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character was very funny and has always been very many brilliant and memorable designs in each series. The Christmas special were hilarious with a real treat for Christmas. The show came in a stop when the main actor Gary Olsen plays Bill passed away that was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up 'n' under a very funny RIP man This girlfriend shows unfortunately disappeared from our TV screens and should not be repeated so often - Though it appears on UKTV Gold once in a while, but it should be repeated on BBC one or two show this brilliant comedy at a new audience
