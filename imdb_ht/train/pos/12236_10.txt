I saw this film in 1959 when I was 11 years old in a theater theater with my family. <br /> <br /> Way back then, I thought it was very funny. . . though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie like a hobby! I saw it again this morning on "Turner South". As I watched her, I was absolutely confused and laughing! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from an age does not go away. If you are too young to have experienced the enchanting period of the story producing this movie, I feel very sorry for you. There is no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a delightful slice of the sky to "old timers" like me. <br /> Having this, all I can do is respect for asking younger people to avoid commenting on such films as the "Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Movies like this have been done for the generation that before the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? if you do not understand the issues the movie is addressing, please do not embarrass yourself by offering comments that ?? franchman ?? makes no sense.
