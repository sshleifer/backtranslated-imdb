I do not know if this film is recommended to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily put some things on this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip - off. The concept is similar, correction is equally frantic and fast - which is good because, aside from the most dynamic film, it obscures some flaws caused by budgetary and other factors. , less erotic and, in the case of "bullet machine", the transformation of the people to an animal in partially a car (sound familiar?) called "Necroborg" (very original) caused by little foreign mimick. <br /> These slightest little scums in outer space actually use human beings as spaceships for gladiators game to play with each other. To infiltrate the body, somehow manage to put a crazy amount of mechanical parts into it pulls them out of nowhere and turn it into a kill machine that targets other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another alien from another Necroborg, rip it out of the carcass and eat it. <br /> <br /> All of the plot sounds a bit unusual and I did not expect much, but at the end I actually liked this movie. <br /> As I said earlier, this is a low budget flashlight, but it's still relatively decent. Do not expect many actors, they are mostly not very good, but they can tolerate. I loved the atmosphere and gore, certain rare situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it possesses certain charms - I at least. <br /> 7 out of 10.
