This was the first movie I saw Ashley Judd and the first movie of Victor Nunez that I ever said, and my boy I'm glad I did. It 'quiet tone, its' relaxed pace, its 'realistic achievement of a young woman just starting out in life, its' fine illustrations of the struggles he has to go through to make his mark of life, the decisions he makes based On real things, people she meets - nothing wrong with this movie. It's like closing in movie magic as I've ever seen outside of the movie "Star Wars", and, given that movie, like that, this movie deserves a real high rating. Ashley Judds 'act, Mr. Nunez'writing, and its' great simple refreshing story make this a fine come-of-age story and a wonderful movie.
