This is a little little horror cops that fans of independent films will really appreciate. It has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent draw. One will be reminded of movies such as the Hills and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not all that great, but the movie really made up for it with atmosphere and solid performance by the actors, which seems to be missing in a lot of today's huge special effects movie-filled movie. The movie really moves along with excellent directions and good camera work. There is no wasted scene, so the film's length is a bit short. In addition, it seems to finish an opening for an end, which would be very interesting as well. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.
