After reading this movie commentary and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I'd add my cents worth saying I thought the movie was excellent, not only in the visual, writing, music notes, acting, and directed, but in place through the story of Joseph Smith and the way he traveled into life of difficulty and persecution to believe in God how he felt and knew to be his way. I am very happy, indeed, having a small part telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see that when the opportunity presents itself, regardless of the religious path he can walk, this only instructs a person who is more determined to live the life that we should with the true value of love and forgiveness as the Savior teach us to do.
