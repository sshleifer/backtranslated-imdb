I spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, DVD, VHs), so I could show it to my kids. The movie is funny, with spike and members of her band show why were the best musicians in the business. They had to be good to play that depressed. I love it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. The film is about a turn of fire in the century, with a crew of misfits that are firefighting with the band department (when not fighting the fire). There are usual running gags, plus the destruction of Spike Jones and his orchestra. Also, comedy relief offered by Buddy Hackett's comedian and right-hand Hugh O'Brien.
