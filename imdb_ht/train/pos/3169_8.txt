I rented this a few years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video hit it in progress (you know, where the box covers the same font and the quick color of successful film) .I did not know what to expect other than what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching was "what's wrong" is wrong with the sound? " - Obviously there was no duplicate dialogue. So echo, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay close attention-yourself does not have Shakespeare here !, Just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boys meet girls etc .. What struck me as funny and sincere was, the people of the movie did not seem like caricatures written in the story, but rather that by actors hacked temporarily in their real work (uniform included). Throughout the time, you begin to sense what the movie is after, then seeing that there is no shortage of humorous attempts (private individuals, using this vulgarite could not hurt the marketing. There was something honest about it if they had a bigger budget then it would be better, which I'm sure to consider everyday, but they went ahead and did it. , I felt, that this self-filmed movie is all about.Mod "Indy" is thrown around as if it's a genre..Ha! .. That's funny!
