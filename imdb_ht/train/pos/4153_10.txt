This was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip in it on YouTube, and I promised that it should ever be shown on TV, I would glue myself into the series in order to watch. I wound up watching it with a friend, who happens to gay, and two of us were calling to the end. This was a really good writing, sensitive episode in the love prohibited between the two cops, I felt, really being (in Coop's words) "The Lucky Ones". it is episodes like this one that really does Cold Case one of the most fascinating and very-liked magic TV shows on CBS. I'm worried waiting for more episodes, and a re-run of "Forever Blue" because I'm still watching it again and again.
