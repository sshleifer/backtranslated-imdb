This movie is definitely on the list of 10 my favorites. Voice for the wonderful animals. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the feline sassy and young inexperienced swine, but the real sting is Don Ameche as the old, faithful retriever of gold. This movie is a family movie movie because it can be appreciated by love by children as well as adults. Humorous and thrilling, and guaranteed to make every animal animal lover! (happy water!)
