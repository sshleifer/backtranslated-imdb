"Amazing Mr. Williams" star Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka and Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who made five films this year, three of which were done together! Douglas is Lt Williams, and he and his co-presented with a dead body, and must know what really happened. Viewers will recognize his work colleagues - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) still play positions of authority ... senators, bank president, policemen. This one has to have a flair in his comedy - the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. Some fun hassles - Williams even took the man to be arrested along a date with his girlfriend. There's a lot of fun stuff here, so get past the slow start and wait for things funnier later on. Do not want to give away any crowd, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall did mostly comedy, and was reported to be engaged in Lucy at some point.
