Absolutely hilarious. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a little ditty and much to look at and laugh at. It's like being turned loose in a museum of Kitsch! I have not been laughing at a theater since Mother Serial. I loved seeing old friends in the Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' Camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Use the best components of past Waters atrium (especially the underrated polyester) and many new surprises. I was sick, in a beautiful way. Thanks, Jan!
