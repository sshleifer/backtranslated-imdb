This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. The boy has food and care for the eagle until he's old enough to be offering their crops. The boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.The Eagle helps his food by catching a duck from a tiny little pond boy. After that the boy shot a deer that a bullied kid claimed to be because the arrows were marked very close to the same. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines to determine which actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because he had made other boys even more cruel to him, and in the end he was chasing up on a cliff but when you think he will fall his best love for the eagle to transform him, in a gold eagle with just a necklace as a reminder of who she was.Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know. I have not seen it for over 30 years, but still Remember part of movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
