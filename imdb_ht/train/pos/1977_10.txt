I really love this movie. I remember once when I was in 2nd grade, my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film bob. This movie, however, can be a bit scary for 2nd student like the scene where Bill Nancy killed and seeing Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives is ill to see this movie because he studied in music classes. If I was a teacher and could class the people who produced this wonderful movie, I would give them an A +.
