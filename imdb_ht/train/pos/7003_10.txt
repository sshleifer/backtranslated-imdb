The emotional impact of this movie has challenged words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled in two hours. This is Will Smith as it matures in his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw the pursuit of happiness and thought, this must be a flu for the blockbuster, the top-actor, Smith. Her performance in both movies shows another dimension of Smith, a review of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I see her differently different now. Seven pounds are one of these movies in order to fully enjoy its essence you must stop your beliefs. Do not watch it for the plot, look it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.
