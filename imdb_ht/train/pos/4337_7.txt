I'm sorry that Reiser (who wrote the movie) felt the need to use many profanity for any reason. Perhaps this is his idea of ​​film "adult", many embarrassing and humorous words thrown in? I thought best of him and thought less of him for this movie. <br /> <br /> Acting Falk with moments of humor as well as some importantly important terms is what makes me give it a high rating. > <br /> This might be a good movie for adult kids to look and laugh about about their own and the foibles. But lack of consideration for family members seriously dangerous was that a family movie but failed. Certainly not worth spending money over, though it might be worth a look for free on TV.
