A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie I can watch over and over. It is definitely one of the top ten top performers. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau described a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his play. It is real in life situations to do perfectly. If you have digital cables, one gets the menu under the screen to provide what's on. It usually gives this movie *** star, but in fact it deserves star ****. If you really watch this movie, one can say that it will be as funny and cool a hundred years now.
