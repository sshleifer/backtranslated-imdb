Vincent Cassel plays part of Paul, a former-con assign to an office work where he met Carla, a secretary who is ?? Well deaf, when she has her hearing a lot of deafness ?? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help one another develop as human. <br /> <br /> What was especially interesting about this movie was the complexity of the characters ?? not stored in obvious stereotypes. Paul looks comfortable at the office environment, does he just do not cut out for work? This belief disappears when it gets a job in a bar and shine. The movie has a certain amority that I get refreshing and has shown how easy it is to act as a criminal, even if we think it's harmless or justified. <br /> Finally, it's a full movie at great moments' both touch and funny. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to encourage a baby screaming. Does he continue to feed her? but take help to hear it out for its own comfort.
