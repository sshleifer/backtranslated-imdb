Green eyes are a great movie. In today's context of supporting our troops, it is interesting to this movie to show the lack of respect for soldiers to receive their duties during this period. From a historic view, at the end of the Vietnam War left us all with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this film, and she deserves credit he received from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie does not show more often, or at all. This film is the kind of movie that should show on television every year, much like Oz's Wizard. The desire of one person towards his lost son is entirely moved. I was a Gene Logan friend, and I was proud to know him. Rocky
