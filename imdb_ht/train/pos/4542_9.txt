Located in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial industrial robber, who stole a 'superior type' turbo super charger, reluctance to go to the United States they follow thieves, after being commanded by his commander. The duck patch is collected by Jay Leno's characters, a fast talk 'but down to Detroit's business-player players. When they cross the path though, 'Ways' of Honorable Japan meet all-out old Detroit police investigations 'The Ways' Police. The two stumble and travel on each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that gets into an explosive equipment team of layers, which resolves the case, cold. After fighting a crime in crime city for 'stolen equiptment' and closing the case, these two go to contempt each other were friends and work well together. A little worse for wearing and in need of an extended vacation on his head, they managed to come to a victorious lock. I rated this one 9. Lewis's direction to do 'this is a close comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it very. (***)
