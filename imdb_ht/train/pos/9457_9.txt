How can you sum up just exactly how fragrant and right and touch this movie is ?? For several weeks this DVD jumping to the shelf at me every time I went to the store - saw Steve Carrell in a couple of films already, I did not want to hit my thinking process in it - so i resist and resist, until finally I grabbed it with a 'Where the hell! 'attitude! And how surprised I was! I just hope I bought it sooner. Having watched it three times in two days I still smile at how the painter of a difficulty widow with three daughters, desires for what has been missing since his beloved wife, who is thus meeting an intriguing woman , good it's a deep and interesting way (dare I say bookish?) way, launching a whole different light on life that makes it realize it's what he's looking for. <br /> <br /> Standing in that woman being her brother-girl writers affair - showing comical shy teeth and a sincere grudge, seeing a "special person" brings these fun and fun to the family home as well as his brother's life. You just really start to feel for him. Then when the blind date arrives with Ruthie Draper - that's the point turning into Marie's estimate in Dan! Look at it when he repeats his comments, not by liking Ruthie - Absolute Green-Eyed Monster! Make an absolutely hilarious scene like two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the best manufactured as Dan begins to loosen up with regard to Marie. <br /> <br /> Other Chicken-Wrenching Scenes - Dan returns from the book and Shop Shop, confronted by his brother, starting to describe what was just held .... when the tooth's face drops it carries a sharp intense breath! <br /> <br /> Lilly's youngest daughter makes the gift celebrate their love for Suzanne, his late wife, brings a little heartfelt heat and a drop as Dan just does that he loses in life . <br /> When Dan plays guitar and songs in the talent show .... his voice craves a bit as it dares to sing this song. ... GEM Absolute! Acne of what happens late in the movie by her daughter ... all three love their dad and want to see her happy, will not let her deny her love for Marie; Dan's devastation does not fail her daughter because she's the stones, the fortresses ... and tell her more than that and just a few words. <br /> I could go over and over but I'll leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future .... but I'll end up saying ... <br / > <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie that's just so good damn, and twisting comedy to the drama, which never feels forced or crab, that comes on as a genuine painting of a man discovering new life - not only with a woman, but also with her extended family, then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN in real life - 9 out of 10 for such a cinematic experience that is well-done with a note by Special Hearts, that your privacy takes place everywhere is never intrusive, and fine performance is not cast in ensembles. I can not wait to re-look this again !!
