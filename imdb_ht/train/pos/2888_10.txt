Any old child sitting in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn drawings and wonderful music of this heart and sincere re-writing of the Fairy Grimms. They will sing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue to sing it until the dead. It is a classic for all children, especially those adolescents who are young at heart.
