Well I'll go against the grain on this movie to look like. Being an independent self-confessed person sitting on this does not quite know what to expect. After 2 or 3 mins I actually found I'm scared (quite rare). The movie obviously has a small budget and puts it around the charter cross station but the movie is lacking in money by distracting from the story. Yes the story is a bit far off and does not explain itself well, but CREEP is a class of acts and proceeds to cut off and disappearing anything that comes its way. MEMORY MESSAGE !!! THIS PARTICULAR PARTY PARTNERSHIP SHOULD BE RANMED YOU IN OR IN WHICH YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES! you will understand when you see it. <br /> All in all a good movie and made a change to see a good slasher movie that actually crises
