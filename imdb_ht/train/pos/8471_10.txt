This is one of my favorite Motos Mr. Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual Lorre is his own self as Mr Moto's debut. Lionel Atwill plays a delightful Zaire musical curator, the usual funny rescue is quite funny here, and there is plenty of suspicion about whom to throw an eye. It's fast paced and fun. The archaeologist does not have the same Flair as Thomas Beck, the usual second lead in these lineups, but it's adequate. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while speaking in a stereotypical way his comic line, does not slip his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his short time on screen.
