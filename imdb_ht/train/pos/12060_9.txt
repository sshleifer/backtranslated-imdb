I really miss the production of old old fashioned movie. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory gave the work of producing such a movie it could have been this one, save for the lack of an internationally known, dropping top drawer. This is one of those films that you look alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not even bother making the dishes until the morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo Director Herbert Wise, Susan Hill Writer and Nigel Kneale, Head of Production Design by Jon Bunker, Art Direction by Ralph Ralph and an excellent cast for making me tremble and feeling so isolated even though I live in one of the towns The world's most populated since the beginning of the 21st century. I gave it a "9" from "10" because of the production and budgetary constraints on TV, they really pulled into a great show.
