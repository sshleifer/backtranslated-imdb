I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just deceitful sleazy is elevated by their performances and visuals. Whatever the case, I'm sure I loved it. From wonderful tight, too, the stories encounters, to the delightful disaster performances from Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the lively color, gaudy and which it's all captured, this is high-class garbage with it in great fun. Not to mention subtex that amusingly slyly and harmlessly sexually penetrating the movie at all, always threatening to escape from the image of the dialog but never does that. I should lie if I said that the absolute entertainment movie did not contribute to my love for it, but there's some sort of artistic behind the unintentional (or he?) Comedy and I really, really digging it. I could really get into this melodrama thing.
