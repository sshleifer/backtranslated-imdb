Disrupting and filming Japanese film films about little beings take people over and turning them into zombie necroborg like cars-beats and hacking each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected. <br /> <br /> Technically superb funny horror (?) It's only for people with strong abdomen as blood and body parts fly. Delicious hinder me from describing what is happening here, but lets just say its very wonderful. If you like this sort of thing and form several steps above the slower content by all means to view this movie. Personally I'm not usually one to enjoy the movie like this about anything but how the sick and twisted to go level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to those I know who loves movies really gory .. It's also a movie that has enough to go through in the details that I want to see it from now on that I know which went on-the-way revealed in the end-I want to go back and see what I was not getting caught on them. There is a rare rare logic of these films. <br /> 7th out of 10 for those who love blood and cut branches, it's a zero or more precisely a run and hiding alert for everyone else.
