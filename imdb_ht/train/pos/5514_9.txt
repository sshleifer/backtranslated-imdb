I watched a party two days ago and today I saw two parts. Of course the parties are separate worlds that I'm a little shaken by all that I've just seen. I felt burned in the inevitable knowledge of Che's death; for me, it loads the entire movie. I think that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the inevitability of slowly investing in his death. Part Two was so downbeat compared to, yet an inevitable, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. Politics in the Bolivian movement has only been accused but rarely confronted inactively. For my memorable scenes were all the end of the movie: the confrontation with the prisoner and the moderate talk with the Bolivian official where Che's official question about the bankruptcy of the peasants supported his revolution. I did not consider the national differences that are playing as many roles as they did in the Argentine conflict against Bolivia. I thought Soderbergh did excellently with inevitable issues of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was struck by how difficult she would try something as Che had tried. I guess it's all in the timing; Is there enough anger against the government to begin the movement; in Bolivia was not. Che achieved the terrible revolutionary korundum in her letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the movie: If not now, when, 50 years of now. A very thought-provoking and well-done movie; Make every effort to see it.
