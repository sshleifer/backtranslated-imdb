After seeing the "Batman Dead End" short, I did not know what to expect from the Finest World. Of course, Superman AND Batman. All of my comic book comic books have them as the team-up. After seeing this 3-and-a-half-minute trailer, he made me want someone to make a fan of serialized fans for the Finest World, if not a full-length current film. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of these superman tea cheeses, but trailer trailers in theaters are still average, giving you only certain aspects of the whole product. This seems to be a complete product. Other than Sandy Collera's relative director played a Perry White achiever, most of the actors were unknown. If an actual movie did, the actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film, even though I believe Nina Kaczorowski would do a good Lois Lane, especially if the closest dialogue is to the character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Her mother is Batman-like, but I still wonder about the lenses of white contact lenses instead of just allowing her eyes to show off the mask. I believe the goal is to find it as close to the funny character than the movie character. Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, Period. He stands beside her with a jump look on her face that simply says, "Slap me." And line delivery seems to be a problem with him. In general, though, I would like to see a complete story with films based on this ingenious piece of work. There was a rumor about a finest film in the world being made, and with the incorrect addition of the script, this might be it. Hope more like this has been done.
