I was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its percentage. But living in Italy titles like this never ever and I love so many steps that I decided to give it to try. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance-movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning". It touches well and well written and directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubted herself, it's so mature and focused on AWARE in her talent (and that talent Rutina Wesley has, my machete falls into the final dance scene). His way of pursuing his dream and refusing to stop anything is, honestly, inspiring. Also, the fact that it is not the super-hot chick typical (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) make it really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really good actually. I even called the end of the movie. And the dance dances are just sick.
