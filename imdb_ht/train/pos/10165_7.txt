Currently my vote is 7.5. Anyway, the film was good, it has those funny parties that make it worthy to see it, do not despise me, it's not the funniest film in the world, and it's not even original because it's a mind that we've seen Before the other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend told me this was a movie for boyfriends ... I think not exactly, but cares? Also there is another movie that shows us almost the same subject, Chris Rock looks at it, the name is down on earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will Agree that Mr Rock won and his movie. I would like that the protagonist male character gave Ashton Kutcher, however, the movie is good.
