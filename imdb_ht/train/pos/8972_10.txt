My discovery in the cinema of Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, in which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up with plant water. Then he goes on making a pan. But at the big hand that crashes the skin and demands that the potter makes a statue of himself. He priced the hand out, but quickly returned and imprisoned him in a bird cage where he was forced to sculpt a stone hand. She's lying on it, is weakening from fatigue, but eventually completes the work. <br /> In a wonderful sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn its visible sail strings, which keeps it in swallow, and it's night back home. She closed her head and accidentally killed by her own favorite plant when she fell on her head. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hide the reality it's most animated, unlike modern movies that make efforts to be realistic (why?). But for example, a person is clearly in a glove. Everything else is clay. The channels are visible and are part of the narrative, making it a precursor to the film strings. The atmosphere is weird: but that after the little potter managed to instill more fear in me than many horror movies combined. The movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity. It is a fairy tale of artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help win the heart and mind of anyone who holds liberty as a natural right.
