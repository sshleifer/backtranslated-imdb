This movie shows the band of transition from Rockers to one of the greatest bands to live in the 70's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> fixed as ever. <br /> <br /> Moon is great, check out the continuous conversation with the drum technology, and see it playing "side saddle" also has a top bass drum substitute! <br /> <br /> Townsend even seems to enjoy herself occasionally! <br /> <br /> Considering taking the scene at 2am no one in the sleeping crowd! <br /> <br /> No many bands in those days could produce a series of tight as this and it's hard to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert in 36 years time will be enjoy as much as this one.
