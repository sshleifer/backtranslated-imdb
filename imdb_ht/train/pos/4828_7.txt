Rupert Friends provides a performance, such as Prince Albert, who lifts "The Young Victoria" at unexpected levels. It is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria falls into a black, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and looking at Ruper's Friend I understand. The movie does not take us to his death, but in an incident that can very well be able to listen to his life. An act of love. I believe it, or I should say, it. I believe it was real. Nothing or anyone gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of the Friend's character. Emily Blunt is good but I did not believe for a minute she was Victoria. There is no real sense of time. He may have no fault, but his master deserves the crown.
