I could see an episode or 2 when the show originally revealed, but when I watched 1 episode on netflix I was also wired. I watched the entire set of like 2 days. :) I really like the character Gary Cole. First it's well thoughtfully then you start to empathize the character ("things have a thousand use")! Folksy Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson to meet Satan is great. Spacious, charismatic, smarmy, and u kind of harmful and not "kind" I mean "really". I want to like it when I grow up. Lucas Black is great too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows ever and you must read in your mind to see it.
