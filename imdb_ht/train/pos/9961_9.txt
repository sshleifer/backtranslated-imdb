I must tell how it moves a near-perfect rating because the content is really great. As a review before commenting, I have no idea how this movie was found itself in listing IMDBs under 100! This is absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those that share the dance theme - can not hold a candle in this one in terms of its combination of top-notch, credible acting, and amazing dance routines. To finish the hidden story (this is not just about winning a competition) is very easy to dig in, and amazingly realistic. None of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means, and, at the end of the movie, it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And, even though you do not cry like that, you could get a little payday-eye before the credit roll.) I definitely recommend this movie to dance-lovers and, even more so, to those who can appreciate a Strenuous and well-acting scenario. How it moves is not perfect in course (that movie?), But it's definitely a cut above cinema that uses nice faces to hide a half-baked draw and / or missing substance characters. The actors and environments of this movie make for a very realistic ride that is equally romantic thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
