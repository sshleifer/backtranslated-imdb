In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and deserves every single award she won and it's in place on the AFI Top 100 list (though she's too low too low the top 250 IMDB list, in only # 183 as in this writing). If you enjoy acting in the highest caliber (voight and Hoffman is a superb match), well-traced features and directions, inventory, correction and cinematography, you'll love this just as much as I did. Schlesinger painted a vivid, still credible part of New York City's 60 city scene and many victims struggling to overcome personal spirits and surviving among amorousness, poverty and despair in 42nd Street, New York City. The humorous technology employed here sparkly takes the feel of the film film New York film (and in the city) and there is nothing less than dazzling. I have seen many ideas (including rapid-fire editing, the touch of vision-on the flashbacks, the drugs / travel sequences and the cartoonish slide figure in during a murder scene transmitting anxiety and terror) stolen by other filmmaker. / <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is occupied in a way that must be viewed as a very strong friendship OR has its fundamental homosexuality. I think the director handled this in a subtle way by cop from the censorship of the times, but rather to focus his energy on the importance of a strong human connection to life, whether it be sexual or not. <br /> </ Midnight COWBOY is a brave, moving film of magnitude, influence and the importance of losing absolutely nothing to its impact over the years, so if you have not seen it, you really miss out on a classic True Americans. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
