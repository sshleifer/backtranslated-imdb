The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles sounds unfinished, as no production can catch the idea of ​​the Beatles' current historical. Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with other Beatles available materials. This is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles' offers us, the simple story we are known without any whims. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here on *** <br /> <br /> warned that not everything is that accurate as some Beatles-graduates might expect. The Beatles saw songs that hardly were even composed by this time. The Beatles do "Ask me why", "PS I love you" and even "Do not bother me". The Beatles-Graduates should see that if the beatles on the movie only make the songs that they actually did in Hamburg, the youngest viewers might not yet recognize the bitles they have learned to know. In this original Hamburg repertoire only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe in "My Tender Love" are double .. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production just look like the original , but the rest of the movie is still good looking as the movie is for the rest fairly accurate. The guy who plays Lennon makes it good and the rest of the band are not bad either. Brian Epstein is great with the moment when it's best Better bag of the band is probably the most memorable scene of the entire movie. Also as a bonus you get to see the original cavern club in the movie.
