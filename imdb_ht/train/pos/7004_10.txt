Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how to do that. I read books still, but if there is a movie with Will Smith I'll watch it. He has a rare gift to pull you into the movie and keep you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and I still can not get it out of my head. Amazing and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Will. You must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand each part of the movie. You can not miss something. Make sure you have many Kleenex and your men / women sitting beside you so you can be cuddled. WELL Worth the money that you will pay to watch it .. Do not wait to come on TV.
