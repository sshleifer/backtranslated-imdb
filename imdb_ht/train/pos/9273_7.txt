In Iran, the Islamic Revolution formed all parts of life, including things everyday. But people still go through living life, generally just doing things you would expect, like going to football matches applauding on the national team as it's in flight to qualify for the World Cup. Except women do not have the right to go to the football stadium to watch the game. A often funny little movie follows the small group of women who were hitting the football stadium with the little band of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a pen holding just outside the stadium. Absorption of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer on the team (no subversive), and small touching people on their lives are all adding up quite a fine comment on humanity against the ideology. <br /> <Improve acting, good script and dialogue, a really enjoyable movie. Fold it like Beckham, sort of - a warm heart and a joy of the daily and fun interests of people.
