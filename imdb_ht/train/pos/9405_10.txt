While Hollywood won the sort of corruption for some years after WWII, England has developed a very prolific film industry. In the "Man of the White Costume", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alek Guinness) created a lawsuit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that certain other businesses are now lucky to go to business! How can Sidney deal with that and maintain her dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness plays before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It is a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world. If you are planning to start any kind of business, you might want to consider watching this movie.
