Joan Fontaine is "a lady of distress" in 1937 that music starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The plot, what is in it, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who makes mistakes for Astaire, a music comedy star. The film, directed by George Stevens, has some nice Gershwin music, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Weakness Day." The best scene is the number "Arrive Upper Lip", which takes place in a fun house. <br /> <br /> The voice of Astaire sounds more robust in this movie than it does in others, and has a couple of excellent dance dance. Burns plays it on public top publicity and Allen is burns secretary. It's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who must dance and Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens could easily have used a double because it shows the dance in a long shot, and takes place among the trees. I would think it was a double except the dance was so disgusting. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
