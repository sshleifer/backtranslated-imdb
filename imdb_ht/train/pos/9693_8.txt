I was very surprised by this film. I was touching with the lives that paulie touched on her way to find her "marie" the little girl she was separating from. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as I thought it would probably do. Actually I was hoping to "paulie want a cracker" joke hurt this movie but even that was done in a very funny scene that looks very much touched when paulie is in the research laboratory press conference. So if you want to see a good "animal-talking" movie checking this one out, better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also had a surprising twist at the end that made very nicely as well.
