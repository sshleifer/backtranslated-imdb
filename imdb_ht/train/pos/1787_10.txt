Danes characters finally left Buddy the terrible truth. "Let me alone, kiss male if you want," she screams up-just before everyone, thus destroying the man who's been in love with her for so long ... cute girl This might be the place Reconsider all of the giggly charms that Danes pour into this character. Great reason to feel liking to lie in bed and die, but hey, remember, there is no mistake, except, perhaps, to watch this movie. One minute This is irony intention! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic sense, yes! But somehow I doubt this what creators of this movie have in mind, sadly. Maybe there a few mistakes, after all.
