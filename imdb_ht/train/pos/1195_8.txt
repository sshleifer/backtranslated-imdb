I saw this movie about twenty years ago on the late show. I always remember the movie, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor had interfered as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost mature man, and women simply loved to watch his movie because of his looks. This movie, however, proved to be an interesting actor she could. He did not get enough roles as this during his long career. This is her best performance. It is totally credible in a truly Gone Role. From what I read, it was a very nutritious and easy guy going in real life and never fighting enough for these types of roles. It basically would just do that MGM gave it. This film proves that it can handle more diverse and challenging roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last stage of the movie has stuck with me for all these years. This movie is definitely worth a look.
