My God! Buttgereit is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's movies, this one is really disturbing, but not rude as the Nekromantiks. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the directive is totally invented, in spite of the lack of money (see the "bridge" draw). Very highly recommended!
