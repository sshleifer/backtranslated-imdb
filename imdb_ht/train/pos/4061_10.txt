This is the best dub I ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on the band, theme, character, dialogue of Kiki delivery service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has different atmospheres, especially the deviation from the heroine common. This one has both heroes and heroines (although I do not really endorse the use of heroes & heroines here, since Miyazaki is from the stereotype & common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, surprised by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this one begins with a bit of doubt in my party. Ask if this will be the first Gud Dudi. Well, in the end just like Just Yesterday and whisper in the heart, I ended up giving 10 ratings. I would give 9.8 rating, but 0.2 in addition is there to share the good mood by encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> One as I see this as a sad movie, dead in this one, the solitaire robot, abandoned place, and ends with destruction. It is as if mankind really can not live too much power. The collapsed scene gave me patches of metropolis to finish. It's just sad somehow. The draw is apparent in most reviews with the Soundtrack rules as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People can carry a movie, a game, an event in life, even to be a persistent moment of surprising composition. Movie used to be part of the American cinema in the classic days (It's a wonderful thing etc ..). Well, things are changing.
