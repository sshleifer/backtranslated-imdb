I really liked this movie. I have read some of the other comments, and although I have mercy on those who did not understand it, I agree with some of the critics. Which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie all the other. I admit that having a nice cast has noticed an intelligent film for the general public, but it has many levels and still looks. I also love the movies, like this one, which provoked many debates, theories, possible endings and underlying subtext. Mr.Crowe congratulations, definitely in my Top Ten. Seeing this when it first came out while I was hiking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to get back to my hotel and I had a great paranoia trip! Where's the end of the dream and the real beginning?
