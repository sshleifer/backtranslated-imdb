A wonderful tragic film ... brings us to a Japan that does not exist yet. Although Hollywood's technical expertise, I have yet to see a movie (Hollywood) that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town near the sea ... Tom Cruise at the latest Samurai liked like the last slice of Lord the Rings in trying to rural old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you love tranquil but intense lines, this is a must see movie. It will be a horror from haphazard films as much as the last 1000 blockbuster you've seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's best stories. Though it's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in these environments, he did not turn into a flick of the movie. The characters are full of depth and acting with so much intensity.
