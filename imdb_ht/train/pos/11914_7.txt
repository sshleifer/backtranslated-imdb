You know, this movie is not that great, but I mean, c'mon, it's about to help angel a baseball team. I find the line drawn to be incredible hilarious, this kid's father said he will take it back if the angels have the winning (because he knows they will not) kid prayers of his false God to help their angels God helps time ever (through Christopher Lloyd's angel, RIP) And in the end his father does not take him back and rides on his motorcycle right in the face of the child. It's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and is friends. <br /> I think the head is that the old lady left alone dying with her stitchin project and her story. The real winner here, though, is god. Because later he received a job as a writer for many tour shows. <br /> As a movie movie, it becomes a 7. As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of "gods," it becomes a 10.
