An excellent film and great example of how to scare a movie can without really show the viewer anything. It's a whole series of stories all around the tenants of an old-fashioned old-fashioned house with various varieties of those serious and horrible fears, all tied together by a wrapped-around story on a Scotland Yard inspector for looking for a super movie star missing. It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character gets a little too realistic, followed by a story about two romantic old rivals that gets obsessed on a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a little sweet little angel who is anything but, and close to the story of what happened to the movie missing movie ?? and what he does the inspector. It's a gorgeous printer that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he could accomplish with a very small budget. Add to what the talents act in Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just do not answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls you to offer a bargain on a beautiful home in the English country ??
