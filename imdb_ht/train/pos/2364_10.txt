I must confess not to read the original M R James story although I have read many of its other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost Stories and this one, in my opinion, unsurpassed most of them are just the same signal. <br /> I can not really blame a view from a mountain - the direction and 'attitude' is perfect, as is the acting, lighting and, of course, the story and writing. I quite enjoy this and I can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production equipment. I understand that the BBC's plans have made some more (not necessarily based on M R James story) for this promise. <br /> 10/10
