I bellied up to the bar waiting for this to be a hot beer on a day sweltering Texas but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering in "Saturday night wrong" I had no desire to see a re-do in some sideways Barnyard Texas .... and I did not. John Revolta was a good redneck jealous, Scott Glenn was thoroughly cast as a former thuggie con, and Debra Winger was, as always, a pleasure. * Love that woman * Plus, the band was dynamic [and this comes from a guy who can not stand the sound of country music]. A fun movie all the way.
