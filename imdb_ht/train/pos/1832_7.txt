I saw two weekend films, One was "Kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both movies are made of "Bollywood" but their world apart. The fundamental difference is the story with the Director. Vipul Shaw made his ineligible brand and "Ankhen", one of the best Hindi comedy movies. Distribution of the Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken in a Play Gujerati is awesome, the treatment is superb and some exceptions. In Bollywood when a film is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director tends to do is register a music director and guy (mediocre Malik in this example) required to drum up six songs to satisfy his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use to appease the financier with the grandma who just cant get enough of these numbers. No music director can churn out good sounds as clearly evident in this movie. None of the songs have no melody and they are clearly intrusive in narration of the story except the background music and the western version of Bharat-Natyam. The Dueling and the role played by Father and Son are acting by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. Its supposed scenes are clearly exceptional. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is willing to wait until a good story comes along as in this super movie. Then we have a cheap classless producer or government such as Sharukh Khan who will be stacking low as plugged in and promoting a waste like "Kaal" to enrich itself in the price of improvement in art, and to surround themselves and bridle talent, and retrieve the investment before the word gets around. These are the Bollywood crickets cautious about the fervent audience award "Film Farce" award given by Bollywood Chamcha and most of them are in the media.
