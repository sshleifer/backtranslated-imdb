Recently, when I was shopping, I saw American gothic box-set, and I thought 'I remember that!' I used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was over CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (I was 14). I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no one can ever be scared as Lucas Buck (and a B!) Nobody ever was anyway. <br /> What annoyed me though they did the same thing in the box-set as air on TV. The funny comic episodes, I kept thinking when Dr. Matt left ??? - they were so confused. However this is not the writer, producer or fault director (his TV people in the background of the money makers are still doing the same - Just look at shows like Carnival and Farscape they do not like originality in the studio !!!!!) <br /> <br /> To finish - If you have not seen this and you call yourself a sci-fi fantasy, film, supernatural drama..Fan = you must. They even said the same at SFX when reviewing the box-set.
