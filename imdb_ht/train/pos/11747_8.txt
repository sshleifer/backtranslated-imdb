A fine effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising to see as there seems a bit of a resurgence of quality Aussie drama. Dare I compare this show in the brilliance of my way of love? No. but it is reminiscent of secret life early in us. The cast is great, Gibney works his magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast also strongly called the Callum and Lizzie characters. but forehe abbey can save the light (not that it needs saving) if this show is to get another season. I was not a fan of her performances of awesomely awesome regular mini series brand in a few years back but it was great as the still lighter half. It's also good to see Brooke satchwell again. allow the expected show to keep improving with each episode.
