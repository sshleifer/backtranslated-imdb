Like the great cartoons classic Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor in different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times ... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie keeps me laughing despite seeing a few times ... Humor in adult-level (that is, humorous adults are simply finding because of the greatest life experience, no baudy or R-rated things can be get here) to keep the movie equally enjoyable for adults. For examples of humorous adult humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies / actors. The Martian Pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and styling of Jack Nicholson; The scientist, that of Dr. Peter Seller and Strangelove. Special effects are amazingly good for this movie. The lack of 10 actors actually works in favor of the movie, and the actors / actresses to play their part well - in fact I would tell the producers to take out actors and their skills for their roles' needs on desk office desk draws (a excellent example is Wayne Alexander's character "Vern"). I had to write this review ... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time of 4 days on dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend has's-nothing-about-and-I'm-bored film.
