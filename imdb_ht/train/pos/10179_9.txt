Grotto is a very good movie. The great plot from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also fits this story for the screen. Some really self-act act, not only by Van Huêt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mainly made TV-works before his performance at Axel van de Graaf. The movie seems to kick in as a thriller, and it sets an excellent mood. Then we start learning about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect of the movie-drama drama in the movie in. At the end of this whole end at an emotional end, which will grab audience by the throat. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you will see this movie. A must-see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (originally the original drive disappears).
