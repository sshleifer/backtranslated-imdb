From the open shots of the lead actor, they give us an early view of how many people living their lives are run by women in them, and the humor that comes with all that goes on in the day to day In Eric Lartigau's "normal" life, the director chooses how many European people feel in complete control over their lives, but without the help / support of women around them may not seem to work. Using facial images throughout the movie is superb, and its smart positioning of members of senior members of the family (mother) is spot on. While there is more than enough laugh in the movie, she still deals with single parent / adoption and family strength in society. Surely rewarding to look, and yet one who only French Couture can do. <br /> So far one of the best 50 or so films I've seen this year, and well worth a starting five rating. I look forward to adding one to the DVD collection when it is released and highly recommended by all ages.
