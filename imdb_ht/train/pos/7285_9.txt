This scary movie screams out of me when I was just a kid. He has no "Citizen Kane" but has his moments. Bra bags are good. The draw is good even if the characters are not - might have something to do with the act. Put some people in the role and then see what you get. This was the one who shot, modified (which little had) and distributed in a couple of months of cinema. This is the classic Sci-Fi budgets budget and deserve it just due. I rated it a 9 other films based on this genre and age.
