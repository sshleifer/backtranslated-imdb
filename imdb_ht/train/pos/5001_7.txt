Slightly do it again. Next to Pixar, Animation Aardman proves again and again how to make animation well. <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of animal comfort. I thought he translated well for American audiences. My only concern is that most of the hearings will not find the subtle humor of this show. <br /> Having a fan of the BBC version with the short film, I knew what I was in for when I sat for that look. The animators made a great work to match pre-recorded voices in a perfect matching animal. Look at the first episode with the goat, who sounds rock, and the dogs in the street who keep calling each other "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? It's not a long shot. In fact, I would be pleased to see the latest show for a full season. But, as I said before, the audience will not find it.
