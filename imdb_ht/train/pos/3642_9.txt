I saw this first movie 3 years ago, and was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, she turned on TV, and this time I stuck it. Since then I have to watch it at least three times. This is a beautiful, inspirational, sensitive film that writes intelligence and believes that acting is all about. He resisted going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all the other glimmers. <br /> It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids are not jerks and have a whole kill in behavioral disorders, and jocks are not described as testosterone muscleheads. These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood as the other extreme goes on these terms of "terrifying realism", making movies where everyone is curse, and he has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream, and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue this dream. The people of Big Lake TX seem so persistent that I want to move. <br /> As I told B4, the movie does not try to go further with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappears. I watched her from the late 70's, and she was so underrated. <br /> But this movie has excellent performances from all concerned, and kudos writers. In the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls him out of the stands. She ran over and came out of her family. Look at the faces of the three other jars sitting on the bench of the dugout is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change of pace, then select this movie up.
