Just pick this up on DVD and watch it again. I love bright colors against black imagery. Not a big fan of Beatty, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is surprising, as always, and well, this movie has highlighted the period where Madonna has her absolute sex. I wish he was stuck with "Breathless" look for a little longer. Charlie Korsmo's first big role, other than "What about Bob?". The makeup effects have cut corners and then keep up for the most part. Beautiful scenery and atmosphere transport you directly into a humorous strip setting. Cars, wardrobes, buildings, and even streets and a large tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes and a lot of red can get an annoying tardy, as it tends to blur a little. Just want Beatty to have the chance to make an end. All in all, a few hours fun.
