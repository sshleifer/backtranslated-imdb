This movie is one of the most provocative movies I've ever seen. It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to show an interpretation expression in the last day of Jesus Christ. It's dark, witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of Jewish tradition and modern interpretation of scripture. Juda is more ordinary than other portraits, not the darkness and chaos that we sometimes imagine, but a great man makes mistakes, horribly misled into his wings. Chris Sarand in Jesus is playful and reliable, faithful and committed - very human while also divine. The final dialogue will be careful and serve as the kind of talk that two powerful men could do when they just committed an atrocity. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
