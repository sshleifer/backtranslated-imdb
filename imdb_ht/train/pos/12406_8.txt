A long-lasting prison, closed for more than 20 years, is re-opened with Ethan Sharpe (the sequel, great character of actor Lane Smith), once a guard, put in place as wardrobe. As the prisoners are set to work to fix the place up, they are instructed to break into the old execution room. This unleashes a fierce spirit that inhibits repressive acts on both guardians and prisoners; Cool-as-can-be Burke low-key prisoners (Viggo Mortensen, showing real pose in an early role) is pushing into the role of hero. <br /> I know it's a no-brainer-the movie praise for her atmosphere (she was shot at a current penitentiary abandoned near Rawlins, Wyoming), but she elevated this horror movie to a higher level. He received a great sense of foreboding, establishing right at the start. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth effort directly here; He received his "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" led gig and effectively started an impressive career in mainstream action movies, chills, and horror movies. <br /> It may have stock characters, but it's got a cast able to bring them to life: Chelsea Field as the maiden struggles for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as veteran condemned Cresus, Tom Everett as restless combine, Ivan Kane as the outgoing lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as soft-pale giant, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It's also worth noting as an early credit act for Kane Hodder (like the vengeful spirit) who helped her land the gig in playing Jason Voorhees in the series "Friday 13". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . It's nasty, Greek, and fun for a horror fan. <br /> 8/10
