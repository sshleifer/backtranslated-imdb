Some films managed to survive almost entirely on originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything in a pre-fever pitch, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to choose to cover up a weak script, but rather think about the reality of the drug. As director James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are permanent on the edge, and often because they are rather quite ugly personality. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes to be a hustler, able to manipulate and control. No offense at Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the weak-minded. However, it's a stunning performance. Comparing this to Hollywood's more 'Kilwood' role as in the "Saint" it seems to prove it is far more in the home of indy flick. There are various little performances that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen screens next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Aside from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott provide a strange, stunning energy in their role. <br /> I originally cut off "Wonderland" because I suppose it was a movie about a porn actor, in the strict sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but he literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murderous mystery, and as such - it's excellent. <br /> Rating: 7.5 out of 10
