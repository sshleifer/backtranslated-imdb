Although I was in this movie playing part of Sherif Hodges, she still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me I'm not that easy. You can say that I'm partial on the movie, and, OK, I am, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and it was very happy. I'm not a movie movie fanatic as these but like the old "B" movies and black films and white Sci Fi. This movie will let you "think" you know when something will happen, then it's not, then it does. It will keep you completely off balance. I would suggest watching the first movie then scrolling the director with special features. She is so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
