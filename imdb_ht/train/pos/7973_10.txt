Perhaps I'm a sage but this is the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I called my eyes out. Between that time and now (embarrassed at age 15) I've seen it over 25 times and have jumped each and every one of them. Do not worry they will water in joy! And it's not all juices! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually everything is talking about the beast can be a great drag but in this film is not the case. Word only to my advice: Even if you like this-do not see the sequence ... cornyness! I suggest everyone checking this out ... you will not regret, no matter how old or young you are!
