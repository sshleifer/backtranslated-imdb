This movie is really good. The scheme, which works as viewer puzzle forces to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a truly looking look forward to solution to an account. Fighting scenes are very good. There are a lot of different styles of combat (although one of the styles was a bit realistic for me, but it's just my opinion) to look and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be disappointing is actors look. Somewhat too sophisticated (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at kung fu-cinema specially in the 70's and 80's, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) are great choices.
