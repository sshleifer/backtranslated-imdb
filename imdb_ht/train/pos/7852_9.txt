The cathedral Ladyslas Starewicz and insects and movies join a short film on a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple story of a pair of adult beetle babies who are both seeking out-weddings are similar to a biographer or short short paragraph in the time. The Starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles and wire rectilinear the feet of frames-by-frame frames. The story is built as Mr. Beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle came home to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friends, he drove him around in anger, but eventually forgave him and took him out to see a movie. However, Ms. Beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelity as the movie to watch is the jealous footage of Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly together. Ms. Beetle launches Mr. Beetle and his umbrella, Mr Beetle jumps off the screen, and they both end up in jail after the projector are captured captured on fire. Insects are placed in humanized settings such as a home or nightclub, and provide characteristic to people of jealousy, anger, lust, and revenge. The bug's character brings brief, motor driven, and even shoe again also shuttered lanterns and open and close the inserts as real insects. New to the story does not put itself out, even after multiple look, but as fluid as the moves are, the film moves slowly. Action is happening with complex details, but quickness and faster speed in filming are lost in the process. Despite its speed, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppet and highly recommended.
