Although other comments are listed here, this is probably the best movie Harry Movie made; a film that reflects - for better or worse - the country's socio-political feeling during the Reagan years of the early '80s. It is also a kickass action movie. <br /> Opening with a liberal, female judge overturned a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight to the caf√© coffee encounters with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene that prompts the famous, "go forward, making my day "line)," sudden attack "is one roller coaster that does not stop in a movie action. The first time you get to catch your breath is when Callahan's chief concern sends to a nearby town to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only the best out there and a group of over-the-top grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with and a mystery and a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography with a once-hilarious script helps make this movie one of the best of the '80.
