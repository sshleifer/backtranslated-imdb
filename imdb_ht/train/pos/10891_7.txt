You Can Survive Christmas Survival. I thought the TV version was somewhat modified way down. I love Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a relative-less adult, who wants to pay full strangers. The Valcos begin James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa's daughter Valco. Drew is lonered around the holidays because he does not have a family of his own so he leases a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who is best remember to play husband's husband Maude is staffing to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing, the truth can be painful. The Valcos house is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Dover's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can not buy what you want for! Acting and writing is mediocre but dropping at the first rate pulled up to the final stage.
