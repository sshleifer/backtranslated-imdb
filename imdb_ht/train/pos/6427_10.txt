If you r in mood for fun ... and you want to just relax and enjoy ... bitter Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started at very good ... but it is Govinda who steals the show from him ... awesome distance with good book delivery ..... inspiring it from bad boys ... but it has American Masala li. .. people think it might be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is leading and Govinda is acting ... should not raise any question .... other movie is recommended in the same way (David Dhavan / Govinda Combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie non. 1, Today. 1, Hero no.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
