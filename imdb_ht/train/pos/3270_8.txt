Perry writers and Randy Howze have manufactured a very interesting story of "The Odds." <br /> Use the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who happens to return to his ex-wife's home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, turn sweat. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey, Jr. makes a delightful performance, skillfully assisted by Cybil Shepherd as the widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this kaper, playing with each other with a graceful style. I watched this movie a number of times on TV, and every time he found it more enjoyable.
