Some people have stated that as of the 11th quarter, South Park has begun a tendency to leave behind political satire bites for parody funding; but this could not be more out of the truth. <br /> While this episode of the parody series is dead, there is more. It is a satire of how people treat the homeless. Characters say things like "They're pretending to be just like us" or "They want to be people." This episode tackles a culture of people who ignore the lower class that are often just down on their chances. So yes, it's still a satire, and also a wonderful parody. What more can you want?
