OK, here is my personal list of top Nicktoons show as of today: <br /> <br /> 1. All grown up / SpongeBob squarepants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a young robot <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Notice a word with only capital letters? This means this is the Nick show I'll talk about. Catscratch is basically a simple, but great comedy hosted on three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon, and Waffles - who get into unusual and really surreal situations, from attempting to join the Sleep Humor Party. The Kimberely for Beer Beets saves a planet from bullets from the evil container. This one nick shows that you'll simply have your funny dice cats sooner or later! The theme song is catchy and memorable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the franchise "Seinfield" - bring the characters of cool life and original personality. The stories are enjoyable (fans' episodes would be "King of All Beer Root" and "Lucky Claw Gordon"). And the humor is all done in some style of Earthworm Jim. So, in conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Zim Invader" and "Mlaatr", which become very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
