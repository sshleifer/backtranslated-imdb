Amicus was close to a good half dozen of these horror anthology in the 70's, and that, from the sponsor to support horror Robert Bloch, is one of the best efforts. There are four stories, all worthwhile, but two - "sweet sweets" and "murder killings" - to distinguish themselves as highly effective in fear. <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) gets bad in her negligence and brutal intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll and she expresses distaste her for her method them. Franks is a beautiful figure of malicious misery and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror movie since Martin Stephens of the "Innocents". This slice is directed with great subtleties and the final outrage, designed on screen, is a time of pure purest. <br /> <br /> "Killing Methods" is about a literary novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, Dominica's creepy. This episode is striking for its simplicity and scary fear. Dominic power or not real power, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The short shots of Dominic are reflected in a pond or seen as a passage of fantasy in a meadow that they are really haunting. <br /> <br /> The original poster art, featuring a skeleton figure holding a platoon holding off Peter Cushing's head, was a richly entrenched for fixed bettors on fears.
