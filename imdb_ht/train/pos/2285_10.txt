I have not read this book, but all of the movie I was awestruck and one thought in my mind: This is so Vonnegut. I never saw an author, all the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated well for films. This film had the same complexity found in Vonnegut's novel: jokes were often significant and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. Campbell was also a very vonnegut character, portrayed by Nick Nolte. He has all the earmarks of a "hero" Vonnegut: lack of anxiety for political boundaries, dark ironic humor gives way to mute inactivity in response to stress, and a unwillingness to push his version into reality on those around him. <BR> <br /> Overall, I was always surprised and impressed as I watched this movie. It was even felt I had read the "Cradle Cat" My First Vonnegut novel, as if the most oddball thing that could happen, he thought of it, and made it real and important. Yes, it's nothing but surprise host "White Christmas" album. So it goes!
