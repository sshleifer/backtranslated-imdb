With this movie being the only Harry Harry movie that Clint Eastwood is not only stars but produces and leads as well, you know he got to be good. Although some say that the Enforcer is the best from the series, I fully agree. In my opinion, apart from the original Harry room, sudden effects and Magnum forces are only two worthy of being in the series. Although the Enforcer is an atheist film with a couple of good action sequences, it does not get the dirty and fearful impact that the other three films do. This movie captures all the excitement that makes a good movie movie Clint Eastwood, and has received the quotes that make a good Harry movie room. In Harry's rush it's "Well, ya Punk?"; at the Magnum Force "A Man Has Arrived Its Limits"; and in this it's "Go ahead. Make my day." Also in this movie it's nice to see a change in scenery, as you get a little bit tired of seeing the same old San Francisco streets in the other films in the series. With great action by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good directed by Clint, this is in my opinion Harry's best ever ending room.
