What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a film movie movie and found that I loved reading more than my youth. Take a tissue, it's not sad, just 'moving' into parts. Finally, it's a 'feel good' flick of the whole family. Note: It is 2 + hours, so consider leaving littlest 'squirmers' home for this one. AP
