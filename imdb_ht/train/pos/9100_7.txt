The Spanish films in a, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age. Pi√®dras is another example of a movie that takes people and conflicts seriously. Although feelings are strong or almost in life or death levels, they are still not really melodramatic. This happened. <br /> There are different stories here, which become connected. One is about the girl lingering, who does not dare to pass the street to the next block. One is about middle-aged woman who finds the lover in her life in a foot fetishist. Another is about the girl and drug problem of lover left her. Still another is on Madame in a brothel that (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. It's in Spain moviemakers to take women seriously.
