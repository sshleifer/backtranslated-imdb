If you did not enjoy this movie, either you die, or hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> An excellent throw, all who gave good performance. This film has proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite that critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very well-respected actor. It all started with his performance at Big Daddy, then he made a bad couple movie, then he broke through with terrific performances at 50 First Date, The Longest Backyard, Then Click, and now Reign on me. <br /> <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who lost everything. The closest thing to her family was a mother-in-law and father-in-law. After college's old college (Cheadle) ran into her, she seems to turn her life around. I'll say no more, because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I recommend this movie. One of the best movies in 2007.
