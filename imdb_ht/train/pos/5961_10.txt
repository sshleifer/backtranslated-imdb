I can be part, I'm the author of the novel The Hunger Bachelors Club, self-publishing in 1994. The cinema was written by my good friend and undergraduate babe, Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character Marlon in the movie. I could not have more fun with the trailer, I hope to see the movie in its entirety and I'll be more commentary. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. It carries lots of emotional cars in fine form. I could not do better myself! This looks like real people, hardly driving mechanisms and thankfully driving my statement against home racial prejudice, graceful and sincere.
