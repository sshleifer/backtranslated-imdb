Though I can not claim to be a comic book fan, I have read my share, so I guess I'm part of the audience in this movie, and I was not disappointed. He runs out of steam near the end, he almost overflows with ideas, and looks like Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, lived on the chairs room off. Also, a little bit of the Blue Raja Hank Azaria can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all these faults when you have a movie that is great fun. All actors seem to have an explosion with their role, especially William H. Macy as Shoveler's right-arrows, and Janeane Garofalo as the Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also love how disco was the music of the choice of the bad guys; Somehow, it seemed appropriate.
