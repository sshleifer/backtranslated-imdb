This is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways. Everyone in my family liked it. The animation is excellent and easy to demonstrate that there are many producers who create such visually brilliant movies as anything from the Disney Studio. One difference from the normal Disney fare is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-sized kickbacks for comedy relief. And, there are no sudden moments where the characters break through songs. I'm sure a scene at the start of the movie would not appear in a Disney picture: the birth of Spirit. But it is done nicely and not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a deep breath in fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another great example of anime cost. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I strongly recommend it.
