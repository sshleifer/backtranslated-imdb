With lots of sunshine, light guard and shadow filtering in windows and chambers, tracking shots moving through crowds and cameras but keeping up, rapid-paced corals and extreme close-ups here and there, photography is the thing in this exciting, artistic film. <br /> The plot of this movie begins out as a bit of fluff on a beauty contest. The movie begins on a hot sun at the local pool, where we meet the beautiful Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the Gawking people by poolside, she soon decides to head into It represents France in the Miss Europe beauty contest, much of the grief of the very angry, rod-in-the-mou-fianc√© (a very annoying fellow, really). Cut the ten runway competitions to show themselves in t-shirts, while the winner is selected as the competitor who receives the longest applause (I asked, could not the girls just walk slower to prolong the lengths of time - and so applause - on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon being chased by a Prince and a Maharaja, but his warm-headed beau does not like attentions to pay him by others or he adores public, for that matter (I guess he just wants him at home read, cook it, and stay out of sight, eh?!). Louise Brooks is beautiful and good, her presence helps to improve this movie, but it's really the way it is to photograph that has kept my interest in most. A bit distracted is the odd armed sound, which is a bit off. The print on this version looked very clear and full of beautiful contrast though. Watch what I just tried to overlook the sound issues and watch the movie visually, and I found the movie to be excellent, well worth seeing.
