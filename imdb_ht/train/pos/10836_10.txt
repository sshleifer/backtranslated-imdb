I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of Spin Tap. This is a must see for any fan of rock 70. (I hope with my friends are not like that in twenty years!) Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the lead chef singer trying to recapture the old spirit, Stephen Rea's match Perfectly in the movie as the glue is trying to hold the group together, but does not succeed well. <br /> <br /> If you love music, and have always been in a band, this movie is definitely yours. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know I do not. Even my family found it funny, and he said something.
