This incredible movie. If you have the chance, look at it. Although, a warning, you will cry your eyes out. I do, every time I see it, and I own it and looked at it many times.

Home Chamber is a phenomenal movie, and I miss it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent act, amazing plot, and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Do not give all the answers, but it does make a lot of good points about humanity
