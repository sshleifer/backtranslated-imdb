I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student, the majority of the usual trash in the time that US TV launches. This one, however, was well fabricated and drawn and had a very nice twist at the end. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was amazed with her excellent performance rather than the gamut of expression from A-B that she normally provided. It was a nice surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the Flying II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can not say that I ever took Jane Leeves seriously after Benny Hill's day but she just managed to deal well with her role. All in all a highly recommended movie.
