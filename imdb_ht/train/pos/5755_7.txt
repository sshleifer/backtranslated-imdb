This is a very unusual movie. It comes across as an exploitation film and over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual to be built around rural races in war with each other, as opposed to an invading 'other'. The film is a too much stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that describe the vets in this war as dangerous psycopaths. Christ Cristofferson's last line is 'I do not lose a war again', as it meets his crush after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction, including the city's chief police and his brother's girlfriend in a particular scene chilling. However, Kristofferson is a good actor, and charismatic enough, to bring this cruel and a surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity layers on his chop cut off. The film brings some similar scheme to Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal fee until forced to act against it. The film has class B-movie action, though the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a gorgeous Victoria Director and Bernadette Peters give it a A-class lineup. I give it a 7 for being a great view of an American psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a movie industry that wanted to address the topics at that time. <br /> <br /> See on the THIS channel, a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies in the 70s in 90s, regardless of bent policy.
