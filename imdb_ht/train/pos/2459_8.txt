A beautiful and touch movie that deserves a wider look than it is likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation Turkish immigrant, who tries to break the mold. Neither entirely in the House and its mutual conservative Muslim family, nor with its Danish Danube friends, Aicha's martial experience has become a struggle to find himself and have the strength to allow himself to be what he wants to be in spite of both family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy managed to swing introspection and narrative for having depth without becoming philosophical philosophical speech, and drawing on Xian Gao's choreography skills paid in spectacular fighting sequences. In the end, however, it is Semra Turan's stunning performance that gives the film this spirit. Raw charisma and martial arts skills are commendable by the heart of his personal credentials. <br /> Well worth your while.
