I think people are underestimating this incredible movie. People see it as an ordinary horror movie that puts out to scare us and prevents us from getting some sleep. What if he was trying to do then he would deserve to get a 1/10 but I saw this movie with a few friends and we found it very fun and even though it was a good movie after all he has Stephanie beaton . This is the reason why I think it deserves 10/10 for the best entertainment in the movie. <br /> <br /> The general view of this film is that it has bad acting, a simple script that a 10 year old can produce and that it can not be taken seriously with those rating it's because of that a. But I see this as a pretty fun masterpiece ... with a hilariously funny script that is made even more fun of the actors and although not very serious it is very fun.
