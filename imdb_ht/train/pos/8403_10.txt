I found it very intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt that the script was transmitting everything I felt physically and emotionally when I got home from work and looking, it. This is a tribute to movies in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guacamole holy! how I wish these days would come again. I tried to put a bubble window on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but vacuum molded muffin trays did not quite cut it. Also in my civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water beds as it is brilliantly shown in the 'wind'. <br /> <br /> The 'wind' is on the side extremities divide hilarity and can even replace porn if you look at some private scenes ... <br /> <br /> I highly anticipate that Sam Grossman his. <br /> <br /> Evaluation John: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
