Coming to broad movies are quite normal these days. For 1980, "Fox" really gave its meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character straight out. Ever since he made "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, he has a strongest character in this movie. She's Jeanie, a high school with a lot of intestines, and she seems to get out of any situation she's in. Scott Baio plays Brad Way before Chachi on "happy day". He was judged by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging with the evil people, chased by his policeman father. Jeanie and his three other friends decided to live on the wild side until they moved to a rented house where a party was totally out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time when she gets wasted. Reality comes back hard where he died in an automobile accident. With one married to an older man. Growing is not easy, sometimes we have come to explore how it is. In fact, you have to be careful about those who surround you. For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay! Great music, great scheme, this movie a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
