Everyone should totally see this movie! It's frantic scary but does not resort to lame "these-out-of-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" things. It's really great. See this fruity frustrated movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, the easiest director ever to live. Each one of his movies is masterpiece, including this one. The splendor is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as carers for the winter, and get snow in. Well, the house is haunted. The kid is psychic. The husband is easily affected by horrors of evil hotels, and ... well ... OR ... Not really. He became a thriller of this thriller where things were thrown into the viewer in different directions, and he became frightened. Not only the classic, "Johnny" here scene. It is memorable, but it can not speak for whole movies. It's one of those things where words do not explain it well, and you just have to view it. So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
