This is a very moving picture of about forty-one best friend in a small England town. One finds a passionate love with a new beginning with a smaller piano instructor, when tragedy hits and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a movie has a tissue box with you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is taken by her young, beautiful piano instructor and a romantic romance flower. Two "friends" jealousy play an immature smell that quickly leads to tragedy. She lost her love with her friends in one flying dive. At the end of an unexpected surprise pull them back together. (In my opinion read apology is not justified)
