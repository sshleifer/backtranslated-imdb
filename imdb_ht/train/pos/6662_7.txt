My Grandmother Gandhi is a well-done movie. She nicely presents the life of the GALHALAL GALDAL GALAAL Men. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal. Just by him, everyone did well in the role they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on the screen I have ever seen. But I'll cut three points as there were some shortcomings. First, film was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it should have. Secondly, the film needs more research from Harilal's character. Somewhere, the character looked incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers did not show them. There was no mention of any other Gandhiji child in the entire movie. I believe Characters like Harilal should have at least some of his brother's differences, considering the egoist nature of Harilal. Anyways, despite some shortcomings, I loved the movie. Recommend ...
