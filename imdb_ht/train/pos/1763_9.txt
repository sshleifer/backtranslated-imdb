This is one of the funnier films I've seen. He had rhythmic moments but was full of charm. It's Altmanesque scenario, sparkling physical humor, and relaxed friends have been a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and I can say with a measure of honesty that I was afraid of Steve Carell's tip .. I was really. Amazing, this is a good-natured, unlucky comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we can find ourselves along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all Steve Carell's friends were flawed, but friendly, and so much fun. The idea that Carell was a serious assassin is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old girl. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, good, and very funny. highly recommended.
