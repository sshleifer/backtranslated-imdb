I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started looking at her, but I ended her liking. I would not call it vulgar ("dumb and dumber" is vulgar, "sweetest thing" is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, would not like or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it looks), and the way of antiheroes treats every woman they would encounter unexplained looks. But the more I think of reading the more I realize that it somehow comes as a little fun gem. I am fascinated as Blier could get away with it. The movie is very fun and very enjoyable: it's well written, the act of not all is first-class, and the music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I think of it, two friends did a good thing for the women to come across: a woman in the train was prepared (the beautiful, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey began her movie career with one of the debuts The most impressive of Clement's stay in "prohibited games" (1952) at age 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; found a man who was finally able to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) exited and satisfied; They are enlightening and educating young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen appearances.) Meet with Jeanne Moreau elevated this comedy at the tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I would like to meet GÃ©rard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Pierrot Patrick Dewaere in real life and invite them for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and nearly two hours flying - it's never boring.
