This movie is a good example of fine storytelling. The act is superb. The story is inspired without being overly manipulative or false. There was a couple point where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were, but considering it is a Hollywood movie, they showed amazing constraints. There was not a single explosion shown in the movie, though they had one opportunity. The film, while having suspense, was not made into a movie action. The story is so focused on an extraordinary man in unfortunate ordinary times. Well done!
