George Cukor led a classic brooding and cynical. Ronald Coleman's difference is at her best in this piece of Noir about a actor who lost his head in his role. The acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) was driving his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) away with his very strongly fueled and irregular behavior. But the two managed to work together to please the audience. Things begin to change as John gets bored and his career; He reluctantly agrees to play Othello. It becomes deep in character as a jealous and murder person. He starts walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually killing his mistress (Shelley Winters), but there is no memory of the deaf dastardly. Colman looks like imperfect in this role. Winter is very impressive as the young woman is determined to get away from her critical life. Also in cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
