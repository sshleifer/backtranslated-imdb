An amazing complex and well-crafted study of the series "The First" killer in the USSR. Set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to life full of the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. This test is in Cicatillo as a well-rounded assassin and does not arise in some of its behaviors while coming out right that others have a subtlety that is compelling without being overturned to graphics. Not for the weakness of heart however as it's matter is often disturbing but necessary in the full development of the main participants in this story based on reality. HBO has furnished us with an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congrats give the director and editor of this great piece. It is in my head 10 to see list.
