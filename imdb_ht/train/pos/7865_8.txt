Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once in all the movie I found myself set off in space. San Konkana did a good job in the movie, although I think that someone who is more glamorous or enthusiastic would be best, but he did a great job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie together. Boman Irani has done a great job. There is one thing that stands out from this film the story it is great, and very realistic, it does not beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message. I think more movies like this should be, I'm sick of watching the same cinema cinemas on and over, they're getting hard to dig now. Everyone should watch Page 3, it's a great movie. -Your 2 cents :)
