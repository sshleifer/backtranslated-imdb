"The sweetness is never as sweet without the back." This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has surrendered everything in his life. It takes things for granted and comes around full of this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the draw and it can not take it to take a rest break. It's a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You can not really appreciate the best things in life (sweetness), such as love, until you have experienced the bad (back). The theme will really get you "open your eyes". Only <br /> <br /> Only complaint is that the film gets very braided in points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you look at it and see for yourself.
