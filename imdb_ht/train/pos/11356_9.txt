This is an excellent movie. It is about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, bureacracy in the Soviet Russia, the drive to one person, and the relationship between the man (the lead detective) and his superior. That stick with me the most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse bad spelling, please!). For some reason, it will move to see the evolution from hostility and offense turning in respect to cameriderie and working together. A line of films in his papers for me: "It would say something witty, but it is overcome with emotions." <br /> <br /> Excellent acting at all the cast, even the smallest parts are made with credibility. <br /> This is not a thrilling acting trash; In fact, it moves in times like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfied and not exploitation of the crimes at all. <br /> <br />
