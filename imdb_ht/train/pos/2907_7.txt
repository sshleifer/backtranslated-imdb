At the conception of a splendid film, investigating the tensions that occurred in family life in the idyllic setting of Galiano Island on the coast of British Columbia, _The Lotus Eaters_ is dirty by the fact that it was packaged as a movie-made-for-TV movie , reduces itself to all by the addition of chirpy music to potentially powerful scenes, as if getting ready for interruption in advertising. A pity, really.
