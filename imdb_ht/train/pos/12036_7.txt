Why am I so convinced there's actually another movie version of this novel from somewhere? I saw the movie again this year as I teach the novel and find changes in the annoying film - no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the finish has changed. They killed him in the movie but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events of Eel Marsh House for many years but remarried and eventually put the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the movie where Kipps laying fire in the office is plain Daft, and the constant appearance of the game soldier signifies the presence of the child is really creepy but pointless - Kipps is Haunted by the woman seeking revenge, not the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier. Do I just imagine this?
