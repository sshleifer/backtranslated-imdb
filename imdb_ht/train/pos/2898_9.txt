What would happen when a depressed cop work with a shrink on probation? There can be a lot of fun ... This movie puts a reference to the genre / comedy genre of the Argentinean cinema. Cheerful character, probable story and a walk between laughs are some thrill. I recommend it for a nice time of entertaining. Peretti and Luque join their efforts to fight a cold and frightening enemy at a time when it's hard to trust anyone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin "Analyzing Me", but does not seem, and there is nothing envy. But if you like to know Bs.AS there are some scenes around the city and the city center.
