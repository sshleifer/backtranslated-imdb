Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. It's a plainclothes detective that drags down a crew of villains, ranging from all kinds of virtual original characters such as the Big Boy Caprice Flattop Blank. (These villains became so popular in the 40's that Warner Bros. created their own take on Tracy-style villains in cartoons like Daffy Duck) Tracy's Comics were known for the liberal use of weapons and technology advancement advanced (notably the bracelet communicator), who received their fair share of time screen on this excellent film. The music was beautiful by Danny Elfman, and the original songs by Madonna were interesting, but they were not the high point for her career. It is strange because as you watch the movie and see the suspense moments, the film feels so much like Batman because of his memorable Elfman sounds of his pieces. <br /> I love the hard-talking kid, the Pacino acts as Big Boy Caprice (and chin!), the Madonna takes on villainy, and the cinematography and directing were impeccable. This film was very professional made with tons of great actors who were known as big actors for a while before this movie was performed (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It is almost like Beatty has seen himself as Tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the party. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 for everything that led to the movie neglected (for whatever reason). There were tons of misunderstandings on the IMDb movie rating, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as was the style of these sets, wardrobe, lighting, and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
