Kimi King Petto is a beautiful story about a girl who's got a boy's day inside a box that is outside his apartment one day. He decided to bring him in and fix his cut. She then left a note for her to eat some she did then go home because she had to go to work. When she gets home she finds it still there. She tells her that she wants to stay there with her as a brother or cousin. In desperation to get her to let her tell her that if she became her pets then she could stay. And as a pet says he would have no right to do whatever he told him. (not in perverted ways!) To surprise him he agrees with and then he is known as Momo, his pet.
