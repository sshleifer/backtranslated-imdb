This truly comic movie has a zany cast of characters, just about every young woman in middle age in Hollywood, with a touch, funny love story. The Capomezza and the Malacici are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also in opposite - extreme - unfinished in the taste scale. Children are cast in their lead role in a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On stage! The driver and confusion of this cause, as parents of fraud with each other and children, have been playing out for us against the canvas at Capomezza's majestic magic house, with its magnificent enchanting flavorless caterers. four over-the-top parents and lovers of the good young men, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a plain-spoken grandmother, a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual counsel he receives from a medium called Blanc Roscoe, a motel-shaped mat, such as the back seat of a car, and two pigeons. There is no eye catcher or a punch line by clicking on this fast paced movie. The names of families in the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low-leaf," and "Malacici" can mean "close-up snobs." <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Mat Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
