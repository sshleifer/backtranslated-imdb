This very peculiar setting to Wagner's latest opera has definitely grown on me. When I first saw it, I was somewhat annoyed by many of the surrealist films, and felt that too far too much was overlooked on the story. However, if you can put up with a fair amount of "GIMMIKS" research, I think you will find that the movie manages to take a lot of strange, the other atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments that are particularly fine . <br /> Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrays her. His performance (a lip-synced mime in the singing voice of Yvonne Minton) is nothing short of dazzling, from the end to end, and alone to justify the hours he takes to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another fun reason in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd in the critical role of Gurnemanz, one that Lloyd made in a circle of opera houses throughout the world. I was privileged to enjoy her in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of Metropolitan Opera several times, with the lusciousness of her voice, and the warm father, father of his interpretation of this noble character really need to be preserved, as done his performance in the monologue of the main character, the Karfreitag scene and the story of the prophecy of Law 1. The version I saw was a video made for America, and so there were subtitles that, alas, could not away. This is mostly unfortunate because the translation uses very precise and force a very Christian interpretation of a film that already forces the layout of the opera. This seemed to me to be quite contrary both to clear AVERIDAN Wagner of Christianity, and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See note on the bottom of this review.) I find it almost impossible to watch a movie titled, keep in mind, and recommend that, if in the DVD versions you have the ability to turn off the subtitles off, you do, and instead, if the opera is familiar with you, you read the libretto carefully in advance. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there are plenty of films in which I'm flu, and would just be soon seen differently ... but it was raised steadily in my estimation, over the years since I first saw it, and I found myself drawn to enjoy it again and again. <br /> __________________________________________________________________ /> <br /> FOOTNOTE A SPOILER: A good example would be Kundry's famous line, "I saw him ... him ... and laugh." This translates, in the subtitles, for reasons that escape me, such as "I saw the Savior's face." It's especially disappointing for me, because in the libretto, Wagner is very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character WHO IS NOT THE BIBLE Jesus as "Der Heiland," ie, the German for the "healer" - a reference to injuries to Amfortas, and all wounds and illnesses and the need for healing.
