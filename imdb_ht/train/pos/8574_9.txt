Fine fun for both adults and children, this movie is working on many levels: there are everything from car crashes and cakes in the face of some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is in its sublimely evil best as Cruella (`call me Ella ') of Ville. After three years of Dr. Dr Pavlov's Dr Modeling Behavior heals his desire for fur ?? even the puppy-skin fur it was so intensely desired. He even has all his fur coat placed in the prison in the extraordinary castle he lives. <br /> But it should not film a dalmatian 'without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change its behavior modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete this nefarious scheme ever since. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is immediately appealing as the hero of the movie who runs the second Chance 'Dog Shelter. Though he was in `Titanic 'and in the television version last year (like PIP) in' Great Expectations' I did not recognize him; well it was ?? Fifth Officer Lowe 'in `Titanic' and I did not see 'Great Expectations' so I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful turn as the pawn-plank of Cruella. It's the most striking and outrageous fad in the fur coat you've ever seen ?? and do it well. It 'Wicked Witch in the Western' homage is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is the not-evil-evil crime ?? it was too ?? Alonzo, the 'Butler Cruella, in `101 Dalmatians' and you can also recognize her from all the 'Black Adder' Brit-Coms. It plays its usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given throughout the costuming of a movie. This is unfortunate that the dress worn by Glenn Close is amazing ?? It is extremely detailed (note his handbag when he was released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and deserves to be like a top-notch character. Her clothes alone deserve at least one Oscar nomination. Animation holds a special place in my heart? but comparing this movie to the original animated film is like comparing apples in orangutans: it can not do. Suffice it to say that 102 Dalmatians' is even better than the movie version of '101 Dalmatians' from 1996. There is a lot of love here: from the front gags, the dialogue, and the casting costumes - it is a good movie for the whole family.
