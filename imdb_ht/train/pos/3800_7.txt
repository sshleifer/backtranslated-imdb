The world of Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity to challenge the world. Planetoids, bits of buildings and unusual floating plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the fallen characters is nowhere to be seen. It is a world reminiscent of Neverending History, when nothing came to feed the world away. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the villain here is the Gobbler World, as well. This time it is a great dragon skeleton and fire. Heroes are a great warrior again memory, an annoying and vicious sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo with a strange useless creature. They are with the world's most chattering girl who, in my troubles, did not die a horrible ground and hopefully early. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Their voice and sound are toothpaste. Too the story is simple as one can possibly imagine. They go to stop the Gobbler World, to reach him almost instantly, to defeat him. End of. There is no real development of character or story twist. Not even those I would expect from a movie and a draw. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: it's a wonderful thing to watch, the kids would probably enjoy it, but that's about it. No depth in this world (pun intended).
