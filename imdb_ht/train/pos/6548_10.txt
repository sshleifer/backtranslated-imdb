This is one big movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I never expected the movie to be so interesting and funny! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secrets of the Old Clock) so you can see how to get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie, because of the movie, they are not really featured The characters are not quick. ;) All my family loved it and the plot was very interesting. This is an ultimate come-back from the previous Nancy Drew movies, which Nancy Drew the actor did not seem to match. This movie is very much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. So cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you must watch this!
