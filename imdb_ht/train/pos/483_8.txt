very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years, but this one is more than just a movie his failure a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it, John Toturro plays someone psychologically challenged, nothing matters to accept 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates it as someone, when it looses a game it looses one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses this to a Beautiful fashion, even the love of a woman was not enough to save her from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon out there who obsess about the game, I'm sure they are if you is a chess enthusiast he will not hurt to watch it. It's a smart piece of work set out well and executed well, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt if there will end.
