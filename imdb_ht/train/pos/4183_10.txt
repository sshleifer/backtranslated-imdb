I've seen this movie long, but it was amazing and that day it never stopped my amazing. <br /> A wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commanders who tried to shed some Japanese ships at Singapore's port during WW2 height. These orders are kept in plain clothes and are considered as spyware by Japanese fascinators. But something happens that has not been explored much in any WW2 movie that I saw. A close and friendly bond develops between captors and prisoners. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of the soldiers captured Australians gets the best of friends and a former Japanese prison guard. This is the most beautiful part of the whole movie and it really tug your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day like two friends talking, the Aussie capital learns that some other prisoners will try and execute sailing to the Japans ships at the Singapore port. <br /> It was mentioned that it was his team and by some others who shed the ships of his Japanese friends, and when they heard this Japanese guard said it kept quiet as it might lead to His whole group is getting executed. But the captain remains determined to confess this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, Japanese authorities are the phrases of death in the most respectable way that is according to the rules. This is the highest honor awarded by the warriors captured in Japan. This is the most awesome party in the movie where the Aussie soldiers are waiting for their imminent deaths and the tensions of the Japanese guardian guard who are still not ready to believe that his friend friends have been confessed to being guilty. <br /> I will not give away the finish here. But it is more than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears. <br /> In all, an excellent movie cinema that probably did not find the recognition that it deserves internationally. Find a copy today and be fascinating.
