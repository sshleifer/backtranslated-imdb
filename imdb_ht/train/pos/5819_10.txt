I loved this movie ever since it came out. I was about nine years old, and now I'm 27. I remember playing the video game about Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show my son this movie. She likes Michael Jackson as well and I know he'll love this movie as I did when I was a kid. Even though it was less than I was when I first saw it. I can not wait to read it out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please leave it out on DVD !! I'm dying to see him again! Well this is my comment I hope a day soon I'll get to see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
