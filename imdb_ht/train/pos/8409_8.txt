A good movie, and one I'll watch a number of times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there are many more than here than clear of the title charts, and I have to wonder how many have suffered in translation. Is there more in the original? Or did you have a native hearing to expect lip-read more? Or - since the cinema was written by the author of the novel on which was based - was this a popular story now and which the audience was already very familiar? In short, very worth a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 original audience put into it. <br /> <br /> The Alpha video reading is waiting for notes in new organs, but the music is not matching the story's progression in any way. Sure, it starts promoting, but degenerates into a repetition, Phillip-Glass-like monotone that reflects anything in the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned to the sound and simply looked: best!
