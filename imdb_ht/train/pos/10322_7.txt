The problem is that the film went up on the coattails of the 60 concept that creates that comic books could only be as "camp" (therefore, 60 shows in the Batman) for TV and movie. So, you have sequel combat with subtitles (come on!), A little unromantic Doc Savage (she's uncomfortable around the pulps, not a fool person), Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet (a guaranteed scene to give you bad dreams for several nights), and totally hokey ends with the whole evil whole guy in gold like a Villechez Herve posing for an Oscar law. But when they're not informed Sousa scores, tinkly little "funny" music is a lot of candidates in the drama. Like this, this movie is ... okay. It's fun, and when it's serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as previously mentioned: it was largely muscled, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a greedy guy with an attitude, by Paul Gleason and an inexplicable scarf. <br /> <br /> The Green Death Sections, for example, are remarkably gruesome and not something I do not recommend for kids. But they are very close to the pulps. When the writers and producers get it right, they get it right - I'll give them that. But if the producers made Doc and care in love and scripting in, say, first Reeves' of Superman movies, think what we might have then. I think the problem is the schizophrenic film. There's a definite sense of trying to make a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give the "hero to be camp" mood that Batman has created. One gets the impression of having a mild, packet-style first draft and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it funny - he worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" Doc live on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not make a tribute to Doc Savage in this movie, the man really is dead. So when the series actually gets on TV (alleged mid-season of '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated 90's, live once more.
