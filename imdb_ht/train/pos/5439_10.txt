Obviously a movie that has great influence not only on the genre buddy but genre action as well. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flicker as many of his Star Wars series gathered in a homage to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks play are just the precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca. Even the Gunga Din Sam Jaffe morphed into C-3PO and R2-D2 with his love or not: Jar Jar Binks. Today this film is viewed as PC non-PC but has a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru's leader in the opposition to the British Indian rage that might be echoed by the feelings of many today. <br /> <br /> For a young boy this was a great movie. Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys judged to kiss the girl on Saturday morning movie was just boiling. Do not like today when the skin is more welcome and fun. Too late in the desert lost innocence. <br /> We hope that this movie will not be forgotten and a few people that are browsing channels will stop at TCM and catch a movie and action adventure, with a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.
