Although the word megmaniya uses a lot to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes dances it is way too stiff, you have to admit the guy to know how to put on a show. In Americas in Paris, it choreographs some outstanding numbers, some are the usual draw, but they are amazingly surprising. (Check Gene Kelly's "Leaving Bed Routine" for starters) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly star as a GI based from Paris, she stayed there to paint, soon she is gigolo woman rich , but he really loves someone! Hoary story sure, but the music numbers save the show here! I really enjoy working with Georges Guéré in this one. 'Stairs in Paradise' with its duet and Le Gene on 'Beautiful' is wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. All in all, a very good, but not dynamic movie.
