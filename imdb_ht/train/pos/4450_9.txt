An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up a morning and loses his cats. He wanders the Woods for witnessing a murder but has seen the murder or is he losing his mind? Is it just getting old? The movie is so great because the viewer made up their own head on what's going on. There is little dialogue in this movie but it does not need words, the movie all speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I loved it. <br /> <br /> The other part that I loved being shot in the woods in late fall and winter. Those were beautiful but the only thing I did not like was seen in the old man in his panties. She could tie the dress slightly tight, but other than that, she was a very deep movie.
