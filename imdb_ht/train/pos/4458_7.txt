This has some excellent spots, but the film length can not sustain the thin dispute. She is another seamen on the movie left, Astaire's eyeshadow 'Follow the fleet', but not as good as 'the city'. Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and sinatra work well together. They 're sure Susie' number is hilarious as they sing the song as they sing it. 'I was asking him' is also fun with Sinatra showing how adept he was in hoofing. Singing solo lyrics are dull and seem to be the elements shown in his songs rather than as part of the story. Fortunately there are accomplished actors supporting such as Grady Sutton, Ragland Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton with an easy but unbearable Jose Iturbi as himself, holding one watching. Kelly is the star of the film, although third bills and interesting to see him interact with kids, who Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and gets on Kelly's character. She also visited a school that caused her to tell the children an artifact story of her life in the Pomeranian seafarer (!) Leading to her wonderful dance with an anime mouse Jerry. In another scene she dances a good Mexican Hat Dance with a witch facing little girls, Sharon McManus, that's entrancing and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice then but a bit too long. A combination of best musicals comes.
