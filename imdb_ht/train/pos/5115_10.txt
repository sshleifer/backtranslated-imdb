I did not see this movie in the theater. I am confessed in an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was Jan Travolta to be doing movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast this year, with Travolta being absolutely devastated when he did not win. How dare he, when there was "real" actor in the run? I'm sorry John, you should have. After catching this film on cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all beautiful to do. I, too, confess never to pass it by when I channel sailing. I have to stop and look. Over the years, I've learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumb in my belt, and learn to appreciate Travolta more. The only irritating thing to me was the supervision, on the soundtrack, to some of the music of Urban Cowboy. "Looking for love" defines the movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that did not make it to the band. It should be a double CD ........
