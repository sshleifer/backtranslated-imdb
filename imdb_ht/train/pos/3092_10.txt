You probably all already know this by now, but 5 other episodes never revealed can be seen on ABC.com. I watched a lot of television over the years and this is perhaps my favorite show ever. It's a crime that this very well written and act show has been canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Omg, Steven Caseman - are all incredible and so natural in these roles. Even the kids are great. Beautiful show. So sad it goes. Of course I wonder about why it was canceled. There is no way I'm going to let myself believe that pregnancy Ms. The Moynahan had nothing to do with it. It was at the perfect place in this walk. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD a few days. Thank you for reading.
