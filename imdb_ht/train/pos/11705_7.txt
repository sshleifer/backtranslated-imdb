Obviously, there was not a big budget for this film that definitely hindered the production. But the story and ending were so brutal that they had made up for a lot. I mean brutally about the level of Ju Ju and other (major) Chinese films. The first time I saw that when I was 14, I was running home and asked God to forgive me for everything.
