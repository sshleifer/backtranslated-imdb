Well the main reason I tuned in to watch this movie is because it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in South Park fame. However as soon as the film began to laugh, they started to burst into my stomach. From the subtle gestures towards a joke, in the blatant bathroom humor at all, with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo. This film can ruin its sternest poker event, be alone poker pockets. Some of the funniest sticks and you'll miss it jokes ever described in Hollywood, along with constant criticisms of themselves cast into the bargain. <br /> I just go to show that not only is Trey Parker adept in writing it's not too shabby in the old act act either. I was amazed at the amount that I had absorbed in this movie. However I'm quite worried that it's not available to buy online, here's the UK. Sort it out boys! <br /> I am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly point out the funny, and occasionally snorting bits of me. All in all an excellent movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However if you have no sense of humor about funny or rude things to get out clearly! However I am sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth might have gurgling past this prejudice.
