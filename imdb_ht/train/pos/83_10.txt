A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on the TV series "Real McCoys". I said then and repeat now it was a good, funny, and fun show, well-acting and wonderful characterization. <br /> <br /> I've just seen about the DVD card old PLUS Reunion episode in 2000 and Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As another writer here mentioned, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) did not refer, but maybe they can be tracked down through Sag or Aftra. <br /> <br /> The show reunion has been well done and has given us many unusual insights into the show. A piece of information inside we did not find was whether Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant deal dispute, which left Luke a "widow" in it last year, which was not very good. Nolan went on to make a bomb in a comedy called "Broadside", about women in the Pacific in WW II. Find it? BROADside? No, not funny. Unlike circus, salacious, and violent TRASH on TV now that so sabotage our value, the "Real McCoys" entertained with decent values ​​and fine human beings. And I thank all involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, because he brought it to my family. We never miss it.
