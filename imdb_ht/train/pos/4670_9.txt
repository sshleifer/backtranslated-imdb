Those who only remember the late Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional caretaker would do well to find this good piece at the end of '60s saturated. Ustinov stars as an embezzler sentenced (we first saw him during his last days in gaol where he is preparing to return tax to the prison governor), some of the future of computer, poses (by means of a clay piece of flight identity) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate a multinational American. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (which co-writes the script) is in the top shape, as Maggie Smith's delightful, here is quite thrown as an injury-tantalizing croc-dolly bird. Bob Newhart also put in an entertaining performance as a suspect with drawing on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as builders of Ustinov and Newhart. <br /> <br /> What do I particularly like about this movie? Not only is a well-thought-out movie but it's also a little little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very compelling as the two stunts are stumbled in love (the whole scene involving piles of cards is particularly effective.) So, what does not love? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feeling of 'late' late 'faces of business' well. Also, there are a couple of small glossy compression that you are not likely to notice until the second or third look, but I consider these to be minor niggles. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is well worth looking out, and after you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
