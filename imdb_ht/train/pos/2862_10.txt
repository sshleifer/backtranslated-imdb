My comment is generally limited to the first quarter, 1959-60. This superb series was one of the first to be televised in color, and was very influential in persuading the Americans to buy a TV color, which was about $ 800 in 1959, equivalent to more than $ 3,000 today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode photo tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Look at it now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First, many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the great day of the silver mining, dating to 1859. For 1859, weapons and clothing, for the most part, not authentic. (The haircuts are left out of the discussion.) That's basically a nitpick. <br /> And, it would be impossible for Ben to reach the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to gather a 100-mile square hike in the next few years. The pioneers were still trying to solve problems in Sierra Nevada late as 1847, and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not played by American Indian actors. John Ford used American Native American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers could easily do thirty years later. This is an important nitpick for me. <br /> There are other time-line problems. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears, and shows it as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories are also absolute between 1859-1860 (Pre-Civil War) and that were more suitable for a 1880 time frame. There are continuous issues, over and over. <br /> It's a bit off-set, too, that there is plenty to kill in the first quarter. In time, the kill was reduced. Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant, which would be difficult to believe, given the time-line but giving credit writers to anticipate the seismic shifts in the nation's attitude in the 1960s. Having all of this, the good act, and I come to the conclusion of my last years that Adam's character has drawn better than any other. I do not think Pernell Roberts ever received the credit he deserves. Also, Season 1 strengthens the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. Many of the stories draw historical real events. The guests invited were interesting. <br /> This was great family fun, and the series stood up pretty well by any measure.
