Fox's era says one of America's largest pioneering efforts has come to DVD and some really outstanding "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added to European liberation), tells the story of the great pioneer leader, under inspiration brought the members of the Mormon Church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) from Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after them The crowds murdered by prophets / leaders, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Prix), carried on the screen in 1940, as America was about to enter the Second World War. It was a daring motion on Fox ruler, Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air in the people of Mormon, as this was the first favorite movie attempt to portray their faith on the screen. Now, Fox, working with James D'Arc, curator of Excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this movie to the DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D'Arc, who was a few years ago made his doctoral essay on the film, provided one of the most legitimate story tracks ever made for a DVD. It separates the reality of the fiction and allows listeners to understand why this movie has appreciated many Church leaders even though the embellishment of the truth runs throughout the movie. One of the fun bits of information contract with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film he married a Latter-saint woman and was finally converted to faith LDS. There is much to be learned from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have this as part of the DVD! There are more than 100 photos from Fox & BYU Archives included on the disc, plus footreale of the incredible premiere of seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another DVD exception - and thank you, James D'Arc for your great book!
