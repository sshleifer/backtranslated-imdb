ZP is deeply related to that young dreams represented by the hippie movement. The College College at the beginning of the film states the cultural situation that gives birth to this movement. The explosion that Daria is imagining, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that great transformation that society suffers in and finally Mark's death anticipates the end of that one sees for the movement itself. The film will be much easier to understand if you go back to this time of life. During the 60 'and 70' years, the youth were driving to explore their deepest changes. One of the most important changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but sexual relationship that men and women of absolute freedom would do in the hipotetic situation where nobody would hide in. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand with each other and appreciate the magnificent way in which an impossible show continues to hide this basic human instinct. Suppression was the way to 'monitor' social crises at that time and that is the method, the police applied to suspend their students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and comes clear when students gain access to guns to skip all fake controls. Dialogue between the policeman and the college professor, who is arrested for no reason shows a part of society interested in this young feel and part completely without interest. Presenting flying as the most accurate symbol of freedom, thieves in the plane represent Mark's intentions for it but, it (go back or come back or return (seconds)) shows the difficulties to come free of those bonds and as I was Say, A painting of the death of the dream is not that difficulty to win the game. At my point of view a movie.
