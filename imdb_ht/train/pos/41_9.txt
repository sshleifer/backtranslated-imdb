"Who does it?" There are so many surefire laughs and gags. It is not just one of the best Stooges and Shemp movies, it is one of the best Columbia comedy products to produce. Director Bernds originally wrote the scenario in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career stroke, he was preparing for the Columbia comedy team in Schilling and Lane (the versions were released as "my pardon horror.") Obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and was finally filmed by the Stooges by the end of 1947. Old Man Goodrich called the detective ace Shemp, Larry, and Moe from fear that he will be must be murdered. When they came to his house, Goodrich disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons tried to get rid of the Stooges. Will they get Goodrich and bring the niece and justice goats? <br /> Shemp is particularly funny in this movie. His reaction after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre is superb; He gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeable trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: close-up of Moe's mug in the camera lens; and the battle in the black and all cast members involved. Nikko Goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most striking characters ever to paint in a Stooges movie. With her kinky hair, she could almost go for a Stooge, if she did not tower on everyone else! "Who does it?" is a gem among the Stooges and Shemp movies. Even dead-hard curly fans will enjoy this one! A classic Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
