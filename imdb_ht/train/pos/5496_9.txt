Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time at the right place" It was so true for this documentary that I doubted about the authenticity of the scenes and thought it included maybe some act, but not. It is all real. The story has nothing new for developing countries and / or poor countries. It evolves light on human manipulation by corporate media, misinformation, artificial polarization of the people does not deliberately create tensions in the streets, sometimes at the point of the host, intelligence agencies or even the government (many believe, directed by the US) uses agents that attack "any" side to induce mass in violence and therefore justify their coup. A marine officer in the film mentioned this too. They wanted to see the people confronted the streets. All these scenarios are played in Turkey (dog animals United States middle east) throughout its history that has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a media pro-government / conservative government opposes religious doctrines in the army, in which a mosque is a very important mosque not an army agent who spokes people etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they were filmed in the inside, perhaps by chance, when the events happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. Whether this has caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and information I would not know. <br /> And whether Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the US and the global economy without reprimand any opposing thinking and strength and in the end becomes an independent tyrant, story says. But at least Chavez is hopeful and I believe it is worth taking the chance.
