This is a fantasy film for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend although I do not know why it's called Back to Boggy Creek as if it's an end. This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie cost. Dawn Wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek and 2 others with the monster coming to their aid. Yes it's very funny and the draw is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y / o band that it targets. It's harmless G-rated kiddie fare and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they look at it. Strictly for the range of 8-12 y / o, older children will get bored and think of it lame.
