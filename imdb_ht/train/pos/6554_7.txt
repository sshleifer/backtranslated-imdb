OK her hair I said: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I read all 1-56 original books and I went to read more. I'm now about 96. Beware of bandits to give this movie a lower grade than it should have. All indication points in a wonderful movie! I loved everything there. So what Nancy is in time now. It is still old fashioned as it is in the books! Those who do not read more than 5 pounds are complaining about the look of Nancy. I've read all of them and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found part of the film spooky. I loved chases of interesting cars and get away. I loved the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see it since the person who complained knows nothing of a what a good movie is with B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. It may not be worth Oscar but it's really a good movie.
