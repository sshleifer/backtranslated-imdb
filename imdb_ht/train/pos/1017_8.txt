I began to watch the show from the first quarter, and at the start I was very skeptical about it. Original movie was childish, and I was just looking for some Sci-Fi show while waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> But after some episodes I became a fan. I liked the characters - Jack O'Neill's not-so-stupid-like-you-think-is, not just-smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, women and children favorite, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories sometimes are not serious, sometimes ridiculous, but mostly it's not about tech or space fighting - it's about helping your friends, even the risk of your life for him. It's about "we do not leave anybody behind". Smuggled in the end when all hope disappears. On the free will and the good of a human - human .. And now he breaks a record, goes 10th season, and still does good.
