What a little overlook the 80's. I imagined John Travolta sang some of the songs, but in watching the movie she seemed to figure out all that was 80s cheese. Clearly films that count on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was her casual Texas. Compare that to Friday Night Night. I suggest watching cocktails and stir crazy to start really getting in the dumbing down movie. Also, as a side note made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie. I was so shocked to realize I never looked at her. A more unusual movie of this genre would include Cadilac Man and Robin Williams. Just remember all the BIG stars played great roles in the movie CHEESY .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
