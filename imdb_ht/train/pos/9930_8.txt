I'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many of the reviews. I think Tony Scott has made a good movie here. Yes, it is very stylized, flashy and overhead, but it is very fun. I'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> This movie can not be for anyone, but if you like the top-top, black humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see li. I've already seen Scott's hand on fire, tide tide and enemy of the State - all good movie, but I love this one more. It's like a roller coaster roller coaster, with great band selection, visual style and at a time when all cinemas seem to be pg13, it is nice to see that one is not afraid to show nudity, gory violence, and have dialogue excitement . <br /> It does not hurt Keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either ...
