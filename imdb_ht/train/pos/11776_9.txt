Chen Jones 'Hare Conditioner' is a fast, often hilarious cartoon. Rubber Bugs Tires against an unusual, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to make it upset, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose environment. The chase takes bugs and pursues it through a variety of departments, leading to an inspiring gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing all the clothes associated with this party in the store. This is great trumpet trumpet, however, not a really inspiring sequence involving elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager of relentlessly getting on or off at bad weather. It's a climatic noise set series that unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag. Since then, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the films chasing large, clashes and wild energies. As bugs became financially in some of the other designs of this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that it could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character.
