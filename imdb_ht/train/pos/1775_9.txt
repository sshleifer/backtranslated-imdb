I often wonder why this series has been crying. I thought it was brilliant and also very painfully written and born. I think that in the coming time he will see in the light he deserves, that's if they ever gave it. Many up and coming young actors comedy appeared in this and all went to the bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be given. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind-Tutt in the largely successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the finest comedian writers in the modern age. Anyone who can produce comedy like Dad Ted could not write something that does not deserve to be published. If it is ever given I will certainly buy it.
