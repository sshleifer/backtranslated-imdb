I saw the Man Run several times as I'm a Stephen King fan and have all his movies, but now it is even better because up to 2 days ago I did not know about this website and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser was involved with this film was Paul Michael Glaser's that I grew up looking at Starsky and Hutch TV shows. For me this is a nice surprise because I can not tell you how many times I called when Starsky or Hutch was hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) nearly died I called my dad's father hard to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a kid at age 12. Now I intentionally look for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on me is so !!!!!! !! Just said Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
