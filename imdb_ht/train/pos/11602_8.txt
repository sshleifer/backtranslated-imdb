Now I had the pleasure of first looking Man Contaminated when he premiered on television back in December of 2000. <br /> <br /> An Infectious Disease Expert (William Hurt) looses his family when an unknown illness comes home read and kill them. Now, some years later it is now in Russia or someplace. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is it takes place somewhere in this area. Anyway, because of budget reductions in an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to lie in most of the workers. One of them, a deceased security guard named Joseph Muller (playing Peter Weller, best known for his role as the Robocop Indestructible) went on and asked them to give him his job back. She needs this job because she is divorced and needs her to pay for child support. So he goes to the, a battle breaks out, and some things get hit on, dangerous things. It soon discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogens. In fact it's so dangerous, a drop in his blood will kill someone in matter in seconds. Soon words come out and experts in disease (Hurt) are called to investigate, and later associate with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to come home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if it has infected the entire Russian population. Now, as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas at Falling Down) that will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal though they have to kill a few people in the process. The next we have a hero-type person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall at Falling Down) which is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> Man contaminated is in fact a very good movie with a good story line and some very good performance. <br /> <br /> 8/10
