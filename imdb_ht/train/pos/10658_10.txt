Only once I saw this film was when I was 10 years old. I remember it all these years as I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just absolutely shines to me. I was on vacation with my aunt at Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this to me as an adult. He took a lot of research to find out who his movie was but I still remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and review about it. I loved it very much, but it gave me a scary! Jaqui
