Scott is right. The best man 2 sword sword ever put on film is in the middle of this movie. The sword fighting with multiple fighters is not the best although quite good. However, the battle in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai cinema. Chinese swordplay scene in my opinion is never stronger than the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a guy must fight a group of enemies, Japanese cinema shines, the examples were Lone Wolf and Cub series. Though the duels in Japanese movies last only a second or a minute at the most, the absolute intensity of those times made them better. But this is an example of Chinese Chinese surpassing Japanese. The scene among this movie was a five-minute long battle with the most amazing choreography ever. The other battles in this movie are good too but though they are staring this movie would get a 7 for this one scene. If you have not seen it, you have. John Woo is the man.
