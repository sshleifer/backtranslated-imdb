I gave the opportunity to see this 1926 movie in a grandiose restored theater that was once part of the Paramount Chain of the House of Vaudeville. Does this Paramount have a Mighty Wurlitzer organs? also has been restored to restore - used to accompany the films silently in the day. <br /> <br /> We were lucky enough to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films in the rhythm of Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions appropriate to the action on the movie. The print was a nearly perfect copy of the negative negative negative rot and the entire experience was a once-in-a-forever chance to see a silent film as it meant to be seen. was the first Greta Garbo movie in the American. It was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. It's a bit ironic that this is a silent film on an opera star; Though the vibrant Wurlitzer added incredibly to the mid-stage scenery, it was necessary to leave much of the imagination. Modern audiences, for the most part, do not understand silent films ?? Acting was different then, with gestures of great and great facial expressions. Therefore, audience laughs at proper times ?? The act is seen as 'hammy' and over-done ?? but it was simply the style of the period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! simple. It exemplifies the truism which `a picture worth one thousand words. 'Even though this is the first Garbo American movie it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had from them: This was MGM filming at its best. The compositions and costumes were magnificent. Special effects? which today's standards are very weak ?? They were always electrified and amazing. The script by Vicente Blasko Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for Garbo; It presents its strength, it affects its assets and has no dirty language problems dealing with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish storm that has no suspicion of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> Co-star was the MGM Response to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that some romantic stars in the day ever would make in a movie: allow himself to look unnatural, appear crazy and grow old ungracefully. <br /> Some fairly good part characters that are more than good to act ?? especially when you consider the powerhouse of Garbo. The remarkable among them is Lucien Littlefield as the Cupido and Matt Mattox as Do√±a Bernarda Brull. This is when the extraordinary cinematographer, William H. Daniels, met Garbo ?? they went to make 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer about 157 films and his career covered five decades!) He was able to capture his helpless beauty and his photography was primarily responsible for the moniker by which he became known: The Divine Garbo. Without its magnificent ability it would not have been successful in that it was. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance, do not miss it.
