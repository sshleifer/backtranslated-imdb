I saw "Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, good. I love cinema movies, and I really like this one. There were so many 'surprise' scenes (what's the English word?) That made you jump into your seat. Though, too much screaming at the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think that the worst stage was ... on the bus, when the figure blinked on the window, or when Yoko walked without his chin. The make-up is also very good. Sometimes you can really see it there, but it always adds a freak look at the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so beautiful without make-up and so terribly afraid and read about. Next time I hear a split noise I'll probably feel awesome.
