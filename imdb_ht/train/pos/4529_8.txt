As is well known among long haired teens who are extremely interested in joining Mr Graf's silence, during summer aristocracy as to travel in exclusive and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well as hordes of coarse snakes facilities. These rare rides around the world also come to "Three Ages", a good and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands, namely Mr Buster Keaton and Mr. Eddie Cline .. Obviously this German love loved The most segment of the first focus on the Stone Age is due to the fact that this aristocrat feels about this ancient time. prefers that in the second segment that took place during the glory of Rome (It should include the cause of the fall of the Roman empire, ie, barbarians, or the same, German). Of course, the third segment takes place during modern times but this aristocrat thought that even 100 years ago would be skilled as modern. <br /> <br /> The motto that moves Mr Keaton and his comrades travels and endorses the fascinating striking of three different ages, is the search for love, a very complicated subject of understanding for aristocracy who prefer the search for money and self interest. Whenever "Three Ages" are shown in the Schloss Theater, it's always a pleasure to watch a comic, witty movie silence (even for a serious German count), a full-featured job with gags and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visuals and amazing technical tricks, an absolute silent silence that is perfect to allow one to hold various farms and coarse summer gravity. <br /> <br /> And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German count must be flirting with a former Teutonic eritonic who does not look at her age. <br /> <br /> Mr. Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
