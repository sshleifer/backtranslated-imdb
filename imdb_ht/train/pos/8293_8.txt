As a 90 minute experiment, it's not up to the standard of "Drive", as the actors clearly learn the comforts of the 'Who are I?' academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those of the superb Mark Dacascos beat the em-up. However, those who love `Drive ', (and I thought it was nice!), Will undoubtedly enjoy this too. You certainly will not return back to the start and watch it all again but you will definitely flick back into some of the action scenes for a long time to come. <br /> It is refreshing to see that the art of thorough choreography fighting is still practicing, though not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys might do with the budgets, time and respect they give love in Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit in the first hour in half and do not send out crazy by the atrocious dialog then you are in for a treat. Bosch is beautiful, and it can really bust a movement with some magnificent acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of courage. <br /> <br /> If you have fortunate enough to be within 500 miles in a copy, then follow it down and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less articulate than Coolio's 'China Strike Force', but you'll be impressed with both the movements of display and the pain felt by the cascade team - (I'm sure there's no Safe way to land directly on your head, or to be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speed car!?). <br /> <br />
