Kurt Russell is Elvis, plain and simple. Her dedication to this role caused me to think, is the best bio film ever. If you're an Elvis fan, watch it if you can. The made-to-TV movie was made two years after Elvis's death. , there are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one to look is the longest one. One shorter has more than one hour of edited edges. It just does not work because the scenes of it often depend on the scenes that were cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you to Elvis children in his appearances as the greatest entertainment star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are excellent as Elvis parents. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent Col Tom Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
