This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There's a lot of love here. The director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired movie conventions. Unlike a lot of contemporary American films, this film takes an interest in what he wants to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the movie that viewers are still befuddled after a first look. When the movie was screened at Sundance, she made more than one audience some comfort and anger. This is a morning movie cafe movie, not a party party Friday party. For the dedicated viewer, it's a treasure trove.
