Granted I saw some "Speed ​​Racer", but I never really watched it and I also saw some other featuring featuring these characters dressed like birds who flew a ship called the Phoenix and another equalizer at a Space ships looked like a ocean ocean container and flew at some times for some reason and it was really dark and difficult to understand for someone who was perhaps five. This one if I look almost every episode and amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution in it. It actually ended, the bad guys made in unlike almost every American design where nothing really concluded as the latest episode of the Transformers generation that ended with Galvatron and the new bad guy vowing to find the Autobots, dungeons and dragons and the kids never do it home, and GI Joe and Cobra still come out ready to try again and so on and so forth. This one ended and made a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to start and as it could not fly and there were only a few really cool weapons. As he went on he got a cool point shoot like the Android 16's used to phone the Dragonball Z phone, then that evolved weapon included razors that shot out. Then the big robot even had wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. It would also find a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called Bobo in America. The villains are not only designed by Dr. Hell, but a really weird person who was half-half women with a dude and a flying head. Show interesting and it was kind of nice to see a conclusion.
