The movies at Andy Goldsworthy's artwork, researching it for sealing and landing with the water, with its sense of proportion - and so slowly, so very well evenly back on movie for the rest of us. "River and Mare" likes Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert in time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in clear eyes. Watch this movie!
