I have never heard of this cough despite the connection to George Clooney (whose company produces and it looks at a very comic supporting bit) and its Ocean Director 11 Steven Soderbergh. Worse, we chose this up at a bin discount for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars in that!) What a grand and beautiful surprise. But then I'm of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it you can not be disappointed. This was very reminiscent of these Ealing trading from England in the 1950s. OK, with more profanity. This is an oddball and filmed film quite well-splittingly funny. This heist made me laugh so hard I was crying. Maybe the funniest use of film stories. Perhaps he was expecting that I was going to look at a group of people and we had an explosion. Best $ 5 I spent on age.
