"Birth of the Beatles", for being a US television movie, released in the fall of 1979 was actually, so far the best film that tells the story of the four boys from Liverpool who revolutionized the music industry and the world. As said by formerly Beatle Burst point of view. The cast performance at all is excellent but the most specifically performed by Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr Dick Clark. Who a year earlier in 1978 produced another TV movie, which stood the test in time to start "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role on another music legend; "ELVIS". This film was led by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" who went to direct other successful movies; "Halloween", "Escape from New York", and "The Things". The same can be said to the director of "Birth of the Beatles", Mr Richard Marquand. He went to direct other theater blockbusters such as the "Star Wars Back on Thursday", "Eye of the Needle," and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other movie that tells the story of the Fab Card I know, is Beat back which has a theater release in 1994. However, the critics did not care for it, nor did the public, so it does not There was a time span of life in the theater. Birth of the Beatles is very good and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the start of the legend and their struggles and the difficulties have gone until the end of the success story when they reach NYC and appear at the Sullivan show in 1964 I highly recommended this movie.
