CAT SOUP has "Hello Kitty" -type kitten embarking on a rare trip in the afterlife, where anything can happen and do. This Asian-style customs ideas used no dialogue, replacing balloon words rather. There is no way to describe this drawing drawing except for telling you for yourself. And make sure no one is under 10 years in the room. Disenchantment with cannibals and cruelty with violence and sudden death and disrespect for others are common terms. Honestly. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim in and around, and also rises. But as practically all else in this movie, that's funny, picaresque interlude will soon come in a horrible end.
