I was hauled by re-imagining the Battlestar Galactica, a show that kept me guessing and leading me to tears over more than one occasion. A stubborn-stubborn fan, I like to think I can pick out the good thing out of the BS, and this was the good thing. As so, when I first heard about the prospect of a prequel series a few months ago I got a sick feeling in my gut. I fear that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be re-utilized in Caprica, which would not work at all. BSG's history, a lot of people who have plagued survivors, trapped aboard pirate shielding stars and guided by prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complimented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica shows that civilization in the great day of glory and decadence. The general vibe I received from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Reports, less overstate and counter-talented. In true BSG form, Caprica has at its first few hours of programming already addressing the issues of freedom of religion, racism, morality of God's play and the nature of souls. <br /> <br /> The casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from obsession and away from the scientist-turn-entrepreneur, troubled daughter and his volunteer, every actor and actress throws themselves into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music, which has been used so powerful in BSG, also plays an important role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful rolling rolls and painful duduks served it in excellent terms. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives her show of her own distinctive feel from either its precedent. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely its own show, crawling out of the Battlestar franchise just as much as it needs. I look forward to the full range.
