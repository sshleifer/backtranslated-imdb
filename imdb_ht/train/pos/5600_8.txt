This is my movie type. I'm captured by strange psychotic nightmares and this film is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror / thriller, there will be others who might see it as a dramatic black comedy. But either way, it is a fascinating descent of madness. Finish me in guard, but what a sequel! She leaves the visitor a lot of thinking about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performance, a complex and detailed scheme, a great script filled with scary and shooter in humor, with a strange atmosphere to do this a worthy movie look. <br /> Personally, I think I'll need to watch this several times more to pick up and understand all the intricacies within. But it is such a movie that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so doing.
