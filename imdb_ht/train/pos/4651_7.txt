I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a little weird sometimes but in general I think it has an acceptable credibility. The scene of the actions is rather nice and the accompanying music used to induce a bit of common patriotic sentiment in US movies. This can not be the best movie ever, but it's uncommon for Sweden and I hope to see even more similar in the future.
