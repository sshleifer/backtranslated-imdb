Like most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one plays outside the flimsiest plots. For some reason - he explains! - He chose to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys compete for me and who gets confused. But as always, Powell's dance is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this one Lahr plays his laughing lion, conjures upcoming memories of this film Teknikolor in 1939. A marginal benefit to hear a young Frank, with this wonderful voice and thinness vulnerability that he abandoned for wise characters -No guy later on. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time showing his virtuoso. Look especially for Dorsey's unique doubt and trumpet, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" maybe in ignorance, but I know of any other drum / trumpet sequence like this one on movie or record. This movie is fun. Even the same Skelton's personality is relatively restricted. Powell shows again that he is the greatest movie dancer ever.
