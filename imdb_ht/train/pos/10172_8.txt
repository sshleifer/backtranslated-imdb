Freleng's Fritzgate is an excellent cartoon Primary Snafu that warns against spreading panic that promotes rumors during the war period. Products, like all Snafu shorts, to showcase military hearings as entertaining films, 'Rumors' are very imaginative and crams tons of ideas in its very short life. When Snafu starts a rumor about a bombing, he scolds in a rumor eventually that America lost the war. This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long piece, rubber and many strange tires, fictional creatures that come back to haunted Snafu and ever more terrible news about his country's military. 'Rumors' are inventive, fast paced and funny, all of which help to cover the work, not the badmouth military message. It stands up as one of the best in the Snafu Private Shorts.
