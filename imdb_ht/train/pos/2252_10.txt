Henry Hathaway was abducted, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people in the early days of US history. However, historic criticisms in his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are unnecessary or helpful in commenting on this movie. In my opinion, Hathaway made the superb direction to translate what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith on the release date of the film. In subtle delivery often and dialogue delivery, she covers Mormon philosophy and instruction in many of the segments and scenes. <br /> I remember watching this movie on Saturday morning during my youth in the early 1950s. That was just over 10 years after the movie released and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I watched were constructing and instile more curiously surprised at which Mormons were. I recently bought this movie and will enjoy the messages that Hathaway interprets into his movie. <br /> 1. Love for Everyone, regardless of personal beliefs, 2. Charity for those in need or not, 3. The family is of great importance, 4. Listen carefully and carefully, because even the opposite messages have points important to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, both individually and in the community, 6. Prepare and store for the next few days in need, 7. Hope is a mandatory link to a higher, and for everyday life We, 8. And, that there is a unique quality of any group, and appreciate what is identified as beneficial.
