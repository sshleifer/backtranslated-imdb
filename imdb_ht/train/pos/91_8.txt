Usually it was a good movie with an ideal end; The act was spectacular and the characters did not lose from the people. I especially love the scheme, although you knew what was going to happen he always gave the surprise component to the entire movie. However, I found that coming over the finish it could be a bit longer (extended perhaps) - me it seemed like it was running a bit; as if the writer was trying to take blankets in the rainstorm. For example- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died at the hospital. Maybe it was one of the setups everything! What's up! Maybe there will be an end? Maybe? If there is .. I cant wait to see it.
