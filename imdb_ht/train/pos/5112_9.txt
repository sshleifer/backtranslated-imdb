This movie has it all, action, fight, dance, cycling, music, pretty girl. This movie is an authentic look of America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Many of oil money, lots of women, and lots of tonks Tonke. Too bad are all gone now. The movie is essentially just another boy to meet girls, boys lost girls, boys become girls back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with any music that best suits this movie, and including American Graphite. It's a movie I watch over and over again and never get tired of it. Every time I look at her, I'm young again, and it's time to go out tonking lighting. The only reason I was only giving it a 9 is because you can not miss a zero movie, I do not feel you should rate one 10.
