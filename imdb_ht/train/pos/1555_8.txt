After looking rather sloppy WW1 spy thriller, Ms. Lili (1969) starring Julie Andrews on this TV afternoon, I suddenly thought I saw a far superior WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. He only took a short research on IMDB to get Fraulein Doctor. Once I recognize the memory title they have come back flood. It is, for its time, a reasonably tangible story that revolves around true events such as the Kitchener and the German Athenian in 1918.It also had a most credible female spy than Julie Andrews! Like other reviews the first and most memorable memory of the scenes are well produced fighting with people and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in film wars and particularly WW1 it is a movie well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
