I noticed that a new hope and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in TOP 10, but that this one is not even in the TOP 100. This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are many reasons that like this movie: <br /> <br /> -Seco of Han Solo from Jabba: wrapped up the Han Solo of sub-draw debt which was established when we first met the character of a NEW HOPE. The Emperor finally revealed: Well this could not work as well now that prequels them out, but this was the first time we saw the Emperor as the children. <br /> <br /> - Chase of Spedite Bike: Well, so this was a special moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments of all these films! <br /> <br /> - Part of Climax Part: 1) The Endor Fight (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke meeting his Father & Fall of the Emperor 3) Destruction of the Second Death Star Lando's) <br /> - The final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool while the whole galaxy celebrates the fall The EMPIRE, our heroes have their own private parts in the woods with each other. <br /> <br /> All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a tight end in the story story STAR.
