This film was quite a surprise. I did not expect much, to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? So, what? Probably a rough and usually exaggerated arm-wav and facial complement to low-grade silent film often shows. <br /> Well, I made mistakes. Greta Garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as he did to me, because this film made him a star, and worth it. It instinctively understands the power of just standing still, or by simply holding a sense of expression for a long time, restoring its effects can be felt and not just seen. I kept thinking myself, how is this modern actress found in a silent film silently? It was just years and years ahead of her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not all that interesting, it is the normal story of love being found and lost. It is only the performance of Garbo as Leonora, the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to the man who has gone, giving it life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is service, but his character never really develops and is demeaned by the script at all. At one point she is wearing Garbo's clothes, leaving in a huff, then ignorant returns and gives back. And let's not even talk about her terrible final scene with Garbo and then his wife. Way too ordinary, he did not have much of a career after that and I can understand why. But it's enough as a bit mystifying object in Leonora's mania. There is a fantastic line in this movie that just says it all. "Leonora, you will become obvious." Yes, obviously true. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it all about without seeing the entire movie, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - Watch the Garbo as it sits well in its luxurious car say everything. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all about it. I must see another, Garbo is just amazing.
