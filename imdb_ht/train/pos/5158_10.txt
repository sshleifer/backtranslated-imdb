There is something compelling and strangely credible about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet will explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have come down to evacuate the inhabitants, all those who have already been left for unknown parties, except for a senior librarian. <br /> <br /> It's politely at the cryptic advice on which all the citizens went on being cut by a crisis in which all three crew members found themselves unexpectedly jumping in different eras in the past of the planet. Kirk finds himself in a long period similar to the 17th century England, while Spock and McCoy are trapped in a desert, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> Intercourse between the two stories, and the different dangerous situations men find themselves in superbly occupied, and return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to exploding the planet. <br /> <br /> Imagine writing and entertaining acting characterizes this episode, with a performance handled by Mariette Hartley as a woman imprisoned in the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the Urban Library. Somewhat reminiscent of the Classic City episode on the edge of forever, this time travel story is a final rich and compelling series, which concludes one episode later. This has to be one of the best in the whole series, especially remarkable to provide the overall quality lesser in the third quarter overall.
