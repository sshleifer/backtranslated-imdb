"All Flags" is every bit the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements fans of adventure can hope for and more so in this one, the girl in distress is, well, not really in distress. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her best athlete, running her enemies in the challenge of social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn embarrassed the top three actors to billed as ruthless Captain Roc Brasiliano and proved to be a violent and capable enmity for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For fans of classic adventure, "All Flags" is a must-see. While it may not be in the same league as with some of Errol Flynn's earliest works (Captain Blood and the Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a lot of fun stuffing.
