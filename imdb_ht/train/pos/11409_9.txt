When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stood upright on the edge of a high upstream balcony, apparently hypnotized and just over at the stage of his death, he immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene of another movie made nine Years later, the "Woman of Green" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is similarly on injuring herself in space while being hypnotic. <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes have survived these attempts to murder by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cynical suspicion in both scenes. When will you learn you can not black out your huge fictional detective?
