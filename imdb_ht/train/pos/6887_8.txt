This is a unique and bold film. It's energetic, and highly developed characters. Performance is very good. I like the director who is not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr to look inside, ask questions, and dig under the surface. By the nature of the film, it practically asks that the viewer look inside. It can take some courage to do this. I can see how some pre-minded people might find this disturbing assets. However, I found it thought-provoking, more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original cinema, with vision. I'm curious to see what he's going to do next. <br /> <br /> Look at her.
