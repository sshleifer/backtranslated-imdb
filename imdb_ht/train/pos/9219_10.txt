The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could also enjoy it. It was very funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful like Juliet. Parents are hilarious.They are caterers as well as enemies.Games to play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the play church.They fall in love with their parents trying to keep them apart .. (Spoiler front .. I think ) They sneak in after a party and do it. Amazing they always want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and scratches in classical literature do not look. If you do not mind these you will have an explosion watching this one.
