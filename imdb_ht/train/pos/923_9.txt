I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD in Netflix as soon as I found it available. I had great hope, and was not disappointed. It's funny, and the animation is excellent. This level of quality I would only be expected to feature films, so I am amazed by some of the bad comments about it. Maybe the DVD has improved animation? A DVD bonus is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I am an adult, and I really appreciate that she is adult. It is not just children who love cute animated characters. It is nowhere near "raunchy" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents would not want the kids to see it. I am very disappointed that he was canceled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
