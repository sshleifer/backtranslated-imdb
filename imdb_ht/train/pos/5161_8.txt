Kirk and land crew on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to move the inhabitants, but they find the place deserted except for a Mr. Atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library. Despite trying to find a straightforward response to him on everybody's side, Atoz is indifferent to the questions and insisted to be quickly 'making a selection while still having time'. They have no idea what it's talking about but wander about looking at ice-like disks on their viewers and seeing images of past the planet. Then, while a disc of the viewer, Kirk runs through the door and it is magically transported back in time that on Earth would look like Louis XIV's time (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and sent to an ice age. All too late to realize that the library is a time travel and storage vehicle. While Kirk's visit is very short and not all that interesting, Spock and McCoy are more events, as Spock falls head on heels for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this terrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the guy virtually logical. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly invented script and very diverse localities make this an outstanding episode - one well worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of older films and has seen him as a supportive and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969. Interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years - dies at more than 95 years of age !!
