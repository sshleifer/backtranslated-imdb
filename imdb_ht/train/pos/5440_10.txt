A trio of ami, sergeant all in the British Army, carousing & bracing their way through Imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their biggest and most deadly challenges when they meet the resurgence of a grievous and devious cult, his impersonal guru. Now they must count on the youngest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save the soldiers of the queen's army from certain massacres. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The hemorrhoids are romantic in the barest minimum, it influences the viewer's interest and keeps it just up (sentimental) to the conclusion. It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr, as they are really all third in one organism - inseparable and, of all intention & reason, confused. However, this reduces nothing to the great fun of simply watching them have a glorious time. <br /> (It's interesting to note, brackets, that McLaglen is selling to a World War II career career; Fairbanks would have a Sterling record in the Second World War - especially in clandestine matters and earning no less than 4 knighthoods Honorable after the conflict, while Grant reported civilian work for British intelligence, holds an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) The real actual Lorraine here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. It's individual humble and engaging dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem true. It is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is quite stalwart as the great mayor, so Eduardo Ciannelli is cleverly incarnated as the Guru of Thuggee. The remaining cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. The film makers will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the role of Father Fontaine's father. The film chooses her neck well. Thuggee's culture devilish, horrorous worshiper, Kali blood-slavery, goddess of destruction, was indignant in Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically pitching up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in collaboration with a number of state princes, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. Now he would stay the thing in novels and nightmares.
