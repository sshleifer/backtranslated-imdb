Typical De Palma movie is made with lots of style and some scenes that will bring you to the edge of your place. <br /> <br /> Most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller, is the style. It has some brilliant edited scenes and some scenes are really numb demolition that will bring you to the edge of your seat. The best scene from the movie; The scene of the museum and murder of the elevator. There are some erotic scene scenes and the movie speed could not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie might not be suitable for everyone. The story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the film work! It might be for fans only, but casual viewers should appreciate well build tension in the movie. <br /> Some nice characters are outlined by a good cast. Michael Caine is an exciting cast of choice and Angie Dickinson acts as well as it's a good looking (not bad for a 49 year old!). The note of music by Pino Donaggio is also typical of Palma as well as the film's costume very well, just like her score for the other De Palma movie, "Double Body". <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerves wrecking thriller. I like De Palma! <br /> 10/10
