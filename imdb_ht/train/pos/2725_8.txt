"In Cold Blood," adapted by Richard Brooks, director of Truman Capote's famous novel, the brutal and senseless deal of a family of four by a horrendous criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly triggering Perry Smith (Robert Blake). The cast includes some recognizable names but they never bring the story into life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminal and disparate personalities. They play in every other effort while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is simply average and is not worth mentioning. Richard Brooks was nominated for Oscar for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some narratives that are advised in the late stages. Oscar-nominated by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the correction. Also worthy of note is the jazzy note by Quincy Jones that guarantees the latest in nominating film film at the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this one does not glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into brutality character rather than outright condemning them. Whether you disagree with this feeling, the film presents an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this purpose and also for the expertise and technical aspects of handling.
