This documentary follows Big Beales's life and little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as recluses in family castles in East Hampton, NY from the mid 50's to the late 70s. Since the founders find them, the castle will fall apart, with women, one 78 and 56 the other, sharing a scam room. The greatest Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the youngest is his first cousin. The original women will be evicted from the house due to its disgusting condition, but Jackie sends them money for repairs to be kept alive. At times this film may seem exploiting, as women seem to be at best in mental health, but in other times, the film is hard to look away. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mothers fire back that Edie will never be to be successful in having thought it was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focusing on choices she made years ago, and the love shown in photographs from her teens, where she was clearly a pretty beginner. Her mother looks more resigned her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible condition. There are definitive suggestions in the celebrity life of both women once lead, from the pictures showing a happy family, at the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see in the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are split and falling apart, and "Little" Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons born on. And of course there are so many cats running around. <br /> In her heart, this documentary is sadly incredible. While neither women seem to be particularly depressed by the many lives, the living scrutiny is completely awful. It's not particularly clear if there are even running water in the house, and you get the impression that they were essentially being abandoned by their relatives. <br /> However, as a documentary, the movie is an amazing view, and it is highly recommended.
