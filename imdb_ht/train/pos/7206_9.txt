Very excellent in a plot of a plot. Shame on two of my movie heroes who have a good snog. Must have my breakthrough :) <br /> <br /> Very well done by all. You never know who is going to do that. The last small twist in the end allows everyone to get their just deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend at all. An innocent, lively comedy language that if it has any flaw is probably Michael Caine's use of the word "blood", but this signature is not it. <br /> 9/10
