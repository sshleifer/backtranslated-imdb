I saw this recently on a cable channel. The movie is great; it's one of the few musicals I've seen that does not shy away from the light and dark. It shows some of the beautiful at the age along with a lot of the culprit. Some of the dance sequences so many pieces are going on, I did not know where to look next. One day I'll go and see this on the big screen, just to see what's happening. But what really lifts this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is it a well-mannered and menacing but there is something else, there are some interior demons. She gave me the impression that if you pushed it to a corner, it could be anything. It was almost as if the Sykes character was on the edge of madness, just waiting the trigger. I saw Bill Sykes Robert Sykes in the movie 1948, and I thought he was 'just' a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance was intimidating me in my own living room.
