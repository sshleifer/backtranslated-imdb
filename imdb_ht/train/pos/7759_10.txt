On the surface, "Writing on the Wind" is a lurid, brilliant soap opera on the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But under it all is a deep, social, social life story of 1950. Director Douglas Circus notes again with another sudser Universe. Robert Stack fell in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best stack, Rock Hudson, likes it too. When Stack finds out in sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant, the fireworks fly. And, all-too good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for portraying her in the big Nympho Texas shunned by Hudson. Good season opera soap.
