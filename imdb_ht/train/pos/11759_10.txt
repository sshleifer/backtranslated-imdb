The best of Times is one of the great sleep ever. The configuration by your patience tax, the development is fixed, many relationships are bound with established love, gags and bits all work and all they are funny. There are many feelings. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower put in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee is sure-footed as ever. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is beautiful, as is Reno's wife, who is a great comedy. I can not tell you how many times I watched this movie, how many times I loved it and how often I hoped that more people could see it.
