I quite enjoy this true in shape to take on the Dick Tracy character. This is a well-made product that has used modern technology to navigate a full-sized comic era history story. If you're a fan of or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy b & w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this pronoun. The color pastel and larger than life characters rendered in a passionate passionate pass on an era is not entertainment as it means to be. I personally find Madonna's music component to be an important part of this movie-CD presenting her music in this movie is one I've often listened to over the years, it's just so well done and musical and trendy in that era. In my mind, Madonna's best moments both on screen but especially musically. This is sure to bring the "kid" to you.
