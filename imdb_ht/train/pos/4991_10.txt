It's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US. I found it a rare video dealer, and it was certainly worth it. This is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-coded era, and the finest film in the 1930s. Managing Director Frank Borzage made a beautiful movie about the Depression, and CASTLE MAN'S created a fairy tale among the Germans in the era. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a beautiful chimney between them, and help make this movie a wonderful romance. Young Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Bill Tracy is gray and close-off. The dynamics between the character creates one of the most difficult, but at the end of the relationships are rewarded on film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most preconfigured pre-code movie I've seen. Borzage uses the dangerous technique and dream of turning the squatter village where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The difficulties in the Depression are never ignored, in fact they are integral to the film. But, as Borzage's craft film as a soft focus story monster, the love between characters makes the situation seem less harsh. He makes the movie warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the crowning success of the pre-code era. If only more people can see it.
