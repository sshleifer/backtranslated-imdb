It takes a lot of time to create a dark and entertaining atmosphere, and a moment of extreme graphic violence has the right impact on pushing the story right in front. Suspension is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian director of culture Dario Argento. The cast is also exceptional, especially the performance crab as a mental writer who opens the doors for his international film career ("The Living Day", "The Fugitive"). If you find the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
