... when this movie proves to be true they are needed. Although some lines, it was kind of strange to see this movie, no, in an unknown language. A friend of mine sent a VHS, including a piece of paper and all the English-language lines. and her translation around me, I started watching this story (it's indeed a story), and out of the very first tunes of the melody whistle during opening credits I stuck. The colors, which act minimal (well, in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful ... along with a few other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette and Bonuses), this one is able to talk to hearts anyone - without words. Whenever you get the chance, see it. Whatever you do - do not miss it. It is once in a lifetime experience. Oh, acting is great, the band is brilliant, the story is simple and it says a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
