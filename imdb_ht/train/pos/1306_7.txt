A very straight-facing shareholder was played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as is to be expected of a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama involved - it's one of those films that when it comes to repeating nauseum ads on Cinemax 2 or more Max or whatever it's called , you end up watching 40 minutes of block when you're supposed to go to work. Together with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Malling", and "The Attack", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget fellow brethers, with a real ability to pace a movie genre, when it's actually interested in the material (ie, do not bother watching any of its tweed torch shannon with a 3 or 4 after the title!) The actors who had too little to do lately (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) really puts all of them in some of the best roles of years - just as for Grieco, it has the right look, although his act is a bit one-note - it's clear his character assumed self- the destruction of the movie, but Grieco does not quite transmit it. I check IMDB and I see the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" & "Dinosaur Island" for the director - both classic minor in their own right, but obviously "funny" Roger Cormone like Cinema - that's more like Some of the best Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-photos in the 70's - give us the exploitation component but offer that involves drama at the same time - a real step forward. Not "Citizens Kane," and their comic moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven top-actor actor-to-video shareholder. Small achievements like this should not be neglected when they come together, which is rare enough (as I recall as I tried to sit in a Montsboro Pyun Albert called "Heatseeker" the other night - this low-budget thing is not as easy as it looks - but that's another story!)
