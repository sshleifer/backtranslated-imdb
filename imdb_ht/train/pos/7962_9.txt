Very few so-called "remedies" can be as good as original. This one crosses the border with color flying. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw it nanatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly invites its comparison of its 1963 counterpart. The earliest film is also an enjoyable and fun movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a documentary than a movie. This update is more seasonal and cinemas. Still, I strongly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We are old Golden Retriever's wisdom, shadow; sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, sasi; and the young, fun-loving American bulldog, lucky. Animals are sparkling voices by Don Ameche, Sally Field, and Michael J. Fox, respectively. There is virtually nothing to offensive to the movie. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing is extreme. No hard violence, save a few tension scenes involving a pounding waterfall, a mad pikupin, and a railroad shaft. <br /> <br /> Hilarious, awesome, moving, and above all real, it's surprising to me that this movie did not have any awards, not one. But I'll say this is just as good as some of the Best Pictures Nowadays candidates.
