This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. I'm never tired of watching her. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character, namely Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems its manners are easy and one you would encounter frequently. So it's a very 'real' movie. One of the most powerful performers in the movie however, is the beginning of the movie when Simon comes to the scene where Mack's car crashes. The film also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotype message carrying films where there's one person preaching his bowel from an audience. Rather actors and actress situations deliver a better impact message without using words. And finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
