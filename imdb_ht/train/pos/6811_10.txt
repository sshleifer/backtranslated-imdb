Although I generally do not like to notice that remakes are waste in time; This movie is an exception. I did not actually know so far until reading the comment before that was a remake, so my opinion is purely on the current film and not a comparison. <br /> The story and the way it is written is no question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words. <br /> Play at Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts are superb. I saw some movies with them, each of them one or the other. I was sure that they are good actors and in Eric's case, I still wonder why her sister is the number 1 star famous and not her brother. This time, this certainty is raised in reality, there is no question. Its game, as well as playing in Mr. Edwards is clearly the head of all the professions. <br /> I recommend this movie to be on your top 50 movies to see and keep on your DVD shelves.
