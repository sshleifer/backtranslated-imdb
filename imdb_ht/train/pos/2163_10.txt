I simply love this movie. It's a perfect example of the well-balanced stories that come from Asian movies. There was a recent Hollywood rumor of this movie, with Richard Gere and simply the terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and beautifully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was aghast when I saw the first trailer for the Remade US Version and who started in it. It's typical Hollywood Communist cross inauguration of its worst. Notice that the argument is that some foreign films can never be improved. ONLY the reason the original film does not become more widely seen is the public disgrace of the audience in the translation. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons this film would never work in an American saying is that reserve, the ultra-social conservative character of the Japanese public character is in trouble in this movie. Certainly the main character rises to a more complete understanding of living a living lively dance, but half of the film's tense from the stereotypes and dance ballet dancers in Japan. Please try to view this movie in its original form, not the full screen full screen. And please make the US renewal jumping ... it's a deep travesty in the Japanese original movie comparisons. <br /> Yes, I know the movie "original" is bigger, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but only two people are likely to see any time soon this one is new and noticed The US. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Foreign Movie, I'll make a few quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-Here's my first list for a reason, outstanding movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistake identity cops! 3. Shiri-A Korean pic action that combines both Asian and US rocket draws style 4.Run Lola Run-A German film that integrates its technological score into breakfast. <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway: -)
