Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think about the suicide borders as the next best thing to do, rather than having to sit in it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a striking culprit, one of those movies where the humor, the plot, the act, is actually very hidden but for those of you who want to go looking for it, trust the director Well, the reward is: u street you .. !! The fact that U has found the above mentioned things, actually makes the movie even more funny, because u get the impression the director is not even aware of how funny his movie is, which does not seem likely and incorrect, The intelligence at the helm of this enchanting project called: Spaced Invaders !!
