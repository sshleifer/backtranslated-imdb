I've seen this movie more than once, and there is still someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then - this is part of the game Petzold: it plays along with the rules of genre. <br /> It's very nice, how the story is very probable in how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet, is again reflected in another, even more probable story, that the girls make up for a casting. This film is a journey between reality and fiction, its more about potential, things that could happen in the past or can happen in the future, than that is on the current level. It's a reverie, kind - so just enough to have a lot of motives, Freud might have been getting interesting for his dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger" - compounds. <br /> <br /> Also, I think, "Ghosts" might be interesting to look in comparison to the current Asian cinema in the mysterious: Petzold's everyday architecture also feels haunted in a way unusual, unusual to familiarize. This movie is not about the obvious. To describe her as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends with lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother, who digs Europe for her lost daughter, clearly does not say much about the nature of " Ghost "at all.
