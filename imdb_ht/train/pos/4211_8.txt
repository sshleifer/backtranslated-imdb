I watched this night on TV (HBO). I must admit, that the tension in this film was outdated by most other FN era films. I liked the way Chip would be all moments one calm and then VIOLENT very momentous moment. It was classic. Ahh wi. Dame, the villians, cigars and thuggish cops! It has it all. This film gave all the goods to me. I especially liked the way communist mixed in the plot, very common for this era of film. Tris nana also since blacklist was popular in those days. I missed this movie one of the best I saw in the genre of FN!
