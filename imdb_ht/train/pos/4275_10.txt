Actually I'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a great American University. But no one in the United States hears of it, which is a real shame! The dynamics of the people is what makes it both funny and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus journey - someplace most of us were !! But I never had one like that !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is one of the places to stop for the funeral. Then the man & woman sneak off for some Lovemaking in the jungle, but everyone follows them without knowing! As it increases its skirt and goes all the way - the design starts hacking & they realize everyone is watching !! Talking about surprising! But ... you really have to feel for themselves though it is hilariously funny! When you see that end it is sort of ironic that they enjoy themselves while they are done! Serbian souls in it's best!
