Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for his films in the film called, somewhat unjustly, "Imitation Hitchcock." Unlike popular belief, De Palma does not rip-off Hitchcock; It lends history or character elements that can be seen in a Hitchcock movie and then raising them in a more violent, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood-dipping deaths with marble humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Dressing to Kill," Made Back In 1980, is, perhaps, the best known Hitchcockian De Palma, and it's probably best to read as well. The story involves a cross-assembled cross-assembled assembly of a housewife burned out (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> Yes, it will clearly remind you of "Psycho," but flickering the movie De Palma is just as technically inventive and creative creativity. The museum sequence is particularly well-scanned and edited; The elevator elevator elevator is also one of the most unlikely to kill people ever shot on film. "Dress to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
