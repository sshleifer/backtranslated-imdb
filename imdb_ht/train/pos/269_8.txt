I'm a fan of television in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performance at all was very solid and had twists I did not come before every commercial. For me it was kind of like Medium to Meet CSI. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else think that in certain light, the daughter looks like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I would definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. Not seeing it in a lot of things and doing his job is very compelling. <br /> <br /> If you go into mystery movie TV, check out this one out if you have a chance.
