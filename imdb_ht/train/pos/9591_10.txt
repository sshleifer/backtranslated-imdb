An excellent document. I personally remember this growing in NYC in the early 80's. This movie is for anyone who has not been around during this time period. This shows something American Indian Gay Underclass felt was only theirs and the love and Camadrie you see is real. The people are real and sadly some are still alive as this is being written. Balls are always kept but not within the limits being in the eighties. This time goes forever. This is a good close to "homo thug" movie. When Queens was really proud of being extroverts. Goodbye Storyville is another epic gone but many documented all the hermits!
