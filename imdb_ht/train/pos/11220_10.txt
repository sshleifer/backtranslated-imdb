Aim for the Head! Gunbuster is one of the animated series that has been classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and that day it remains my favorite anime. And while it was not the first Gainax animated product, it was the first OVA series. Mostly starting out as an imitation of the 1970 's Drama Sports Ace for Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama towards ending episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to revive the death of her father ', who died at first to meet the humanity and the human bug race is at war with. It is because of his father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But his lack of confidence proved to be found in the way at times and he falters. His friend, Kazumi Amano, even doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach Koichiro Ota trusts in him. And he made it his personal mission to see that he succeeded in becoming a pilot, because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father died. Other characters included Jung-Freud, a Russian Combat Pilot assigned to the use of Eskimo Noriko and Kazumi belonging to Smith Toren, a favorite interest for Noriko who died in the first outing together, and Kimiko Higuchi, friend of Noriko. Kimiko's concerns are also of interest, as Noriko is cut off in space, Kimiko stays behind Earth to live a normal life. And because of the acts of dilation, Kimiko normally walks on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old while Kimiko is in the mid-fifty soldiers. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent excellent set to look if you are a fan of giant mecha robots and at Gainax animation. If you like the other Hideaki Anno show, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.
