I like this movie. As a kid, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me flinch. Sure, he's serious now, but back in the day he was scared. Dentists are one thing for many people, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's scary. And I still have a love for medical horrors. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly, no one could do it better. And for a low film film, the effects and those are quite good. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this one playing a natural cop, and doing a fine job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture / death scenes. Check out this one out!
