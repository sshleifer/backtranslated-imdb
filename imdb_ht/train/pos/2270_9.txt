The film is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does great work to express the feelings from the book of the movie. Not many films engage in the book as well as Mother's Night Make.
