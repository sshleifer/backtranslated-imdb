Yeah, the poster is quite a horrific piece of work. <br /> I think the movie was OK ... nothing really outstanding ... I just hoped it would be a hardcore druggie and totally garbing her life. <br /> Ahh, but that can not happen to rich children now can it? Not the son of a wealthy businessman who holds the party's big salon and has a beautiful lawn maintenance on the front of the mini castle. <br /> No ... The kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all, who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> Ah, the poor little kids are rich ... in the picturesque beautiful houses, with ivy lions school, ultra clean home and socialite parts ... what will the world be without them? I hope they are all addicted to drugs, pass-away lives and end up in jail ... So maybe we can see movies that do not all turn around the poor rich boys and girls in the surreal world.
