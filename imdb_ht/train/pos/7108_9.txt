Do you like to solve mystery? You love normal complexes? This is for you. Brilliant, smart film by Francis Leclerc (son of a Canadian French legend signed by Felix Leclerc). Flash photo and smart editing is Leclerc's words, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who dythirambic in the lead role. The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, his 40's vet who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by an unknown man. Tourers are fighting to remember who hit him as he end up suffering the deer along the way. During all difficulties, she has strange behaviors and looks like something has taken on her. <br /> Not spooky, but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my hypothesis on the end (I think the American has caused the injury) but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> I recommend it 9.5 / 10
