For Urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha men ever described on the big screen. It's a decent enough young kid who left her parent homestead and knocked out for the big city in Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to get her work in the petrochemical industry. In the 1980's began to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She met with Debra Winger's married couple in the same background, but she had some ideas that women would not be shady of the guys. But when he defeated Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's it for him. Scott Glenn is an old convicted working at the Gilley and this film was the role of his excursion. It's a real snake in urban cowboy, she gets the goat Travolta with a look and she's moving on to the bitch. Travolta in turn takes up with rich girls, Madolyn Smith Osborne who's slumming in the Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was truly a single gigantic commercial for the top-styled tiger honky tone of the world. The Gilley has not yet joined the Texas suburban community in Pasadena, but the memories live on. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful note of land / western songs featured in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but it's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignores the music aspect of this movie. I especially like Johnny Lee looking for love, if she was specifically writing for this movie, it's a shame that she was not nominated for the best song. <br /> I love Debra's favorite character in this movie. He does not lose a trace of femininity, but he stands up to Travolta and makes it in style. And this review is dedicated to this again as unknown woman who will one day be the first bull-rider woman at the Bull Bull Bull.
