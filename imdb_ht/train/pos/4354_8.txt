I saw this movie back in the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and in the 14 films I saw there I would rank this # 4. The 900+ theater was filled with the end of it getting a standing ovation. This was Peter Falk's classic if you're a fan of Falk and appeared a lot of chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The movie film looks so long and too odd sounding for me. I wonder this did not do it in general release. This was far better than the majority junk that the largest studio cast at you. Perhaps too old in that he was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience. A lot of people could relate to the situation in this movie. This will probably enjoy a revival of quality years now when people look back to this movie and consider it a kind of a gem. I would miss this 8.0 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
