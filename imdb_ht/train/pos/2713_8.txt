Wilson (Erica Gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to jail in this slippery and entertaining example of the previous 70's exploitation, which marks the first director of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing some of New York's film concerts in the world, Demme has given the opportunity to run for the first time and delivers a film that not only delivers the expected and delicious dips of stripping and violence but has a appeal against language-in-cheek quality as well; It is often as funny as it is flashy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! wonderful in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene going haywire with a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. As in other movies of this kind, it's also laudable that it's as much a standalone portrait of girls as it is pure exploitation. These women are hard, they do not get any garbage in anybody, and they are more likely to touch themselves. <br /> <br /> Throw to attract us here to make the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as Maggie's aggressive, Roberta Collins as the sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the lovely and timid Lavender, Gavin as the wide Newcomer -Peas, and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. As our biggest point of play, Demme comes with a tension "beat the clock" to finish as our heroine race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predator Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the kind of person who thinks nothing to take advantage of women. <br /> <br /> Bouncing along with John Cales' caliber, "Caged Heat" is amusing optimism and a good time guarantee. <br /> <br /> 8/10
