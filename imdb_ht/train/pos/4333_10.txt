saw this in great-great-great-looking character - witty and intelligent dialogue- actors were fantastic - Peter Falk going up for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was good - photography was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie, and gave a vivid account of the movie - it was a dream of his time to write a semi-autobiographical account of the relationship between the son and the father, and more specifically between him and his father, - This has been achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion- cast in support has been well-chosen and has given the film a family -motion I recommend to this movie to anyone who wants to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
