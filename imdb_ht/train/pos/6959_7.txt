Well, this is a movie by Ivan Reitman. With rare exceptions, Ivan loves to entertain. His films generally are not "deep", but they are often fun enough. My super-ex girlfriend surprised me in that I laughed more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just so grand, and I love his portrait. I love Luke Wilson too, and Rainn Wilson was a straightforward. Never take it seriously, the movie is on the top and yet it's not very unique, nor it goes where no one goes before .... it's a nice rent though and probably a date movie OK, especially if You have a headache and do not want to force your brain. It's fun and nothing is wrong with that. When you strip off the "super-girl" things, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships go bad. She is a boy to meet girls, boys leave things girls .And in the end, characters They are looking for love. Not all of them have been "thrown" as well as being able to .... a slice of life with a twist.
