I really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as I expected it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although the first time I thought I could not stand his character. He and Megyn's prices had little athlete at all, but hopefully the season goes on will get more comfortable at each other. It must have been strange for Megyn to attend the star on his latest show ["broken for life"] being a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene, but I think in time they will get better. David Spade character, in my surprise, was not the whole focus of this pilot. His way to deliver his line is so different from anyone else I've ever seen on TV, but I think he's just his style. It works for him. <br /> I think that couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all their doubts and battles and have ended up on your decisions, which show that this is over. All the situations that the characters wear to just feel like real life, not sugar-coated like most shows. <br /> I hope for all the actors that CBS gives them a chance. Show this has the potential to be one of the best series, if just give the chance and time.
