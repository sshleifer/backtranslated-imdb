Who made this movie? I like this movie? Someone has a wacky sense of humor ... This Zany, surreal style of making films is appealing, but it's hard to create - or easily forget - that substance, and characters that actually have soul, that is given a movie depth. Without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. It can get laughter, but it goes to you as a half-good hamburger ... next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed can not intend to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They sneak up on you. I started this movie thinking "Oh, I found it - independent comedy - on the wall - Gonzo ... yes." And it is that - but if you pay attention there is sub text and character characters to fill it out. In this sense the movie breathe. He makes a pause proposal - if you're available to see them - and then of course, it goes on insanely happy. <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign the contracts to stop believing at the time of the movie. Stage between reality and surrealism is one of the movie points. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but clever people have done it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The food room scene is an absolute HOOT. <br /> Put on your safety belt.
