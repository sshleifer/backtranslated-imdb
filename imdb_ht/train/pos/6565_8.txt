I know the movie snobs are snorting. But if you are looking for a fun surprise ride in the B-film jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> A little bit of liver, but his one-materio and the more place then make up for that. John Hurt (God loves him), seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra malicious white slaver. Enmi Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you wonder why they both put one another. However, along with both Crawford and Christopher shows a team that is just so much fun that if you can get on top For a moment, you can find yourself acting like a kid in situations and suspicions inherent in giving. Karen The delicious copies make a great job as the girl in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her salvage then her tormentor. I have yet to find a movie that is very fun without getting preachy, or bogging down the movie by trying too hard. Not all films must be the latest "Citizens Kane". And trust me, Wells was an original. So let's remember that sometimes, movies are for fun.No social commentary or try to persuade a political audience. But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
