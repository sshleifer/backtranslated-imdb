This is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Put in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the TV networks. One of the most popular TV shows is the "Running Man", where convicted criminals are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. It was set up as a game show, where the audience voted for their favorite "Stalker", killer trained to hunt down and kill the "wrong" competition show. Members of the audience also have the prizes to correctly predict who will die by whom. And the host played by none other than the Richard Dawson Family Family, which in the game show experiment makes him well suited for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is lying accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. This film is full of classic Arnold One-Material, as his famous "I'll be back" straight before it enters the arena. And he taunt a armed stalker with a flamethrower and "How about a light?" I could go over and over, but I do not want to spoil the movie. It's funny thing! <br /> Whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "TV reality" craze. Already there are many programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for viewers of the viewers, and even the courts can be televised for their "fun entertainment". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if TV reality hits rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. One can only expect that the networks have common sense by letting it go so far. <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie & I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
