1st view 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dirty-Sidney Franklin): Well said account of farmers in China and riding them in importance and struggle with what nature nature launches into them. This film is based on a novel award novel and a family history begins with the son's wedding row in a slave girl. The film does a great job of keeping your interest despite a bit of collective performance by the lead playing by Paul Muni. It's history, Wong Long (the character plays by Muni) and how it works the country, buys more land, eventually becoming very wealthy but then returning to the country where it started originally. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main thread of the story (besides the country itself) and despite the non-Chinese actors obviously doing a very good job in land show and to his people. It is obvious that MGM used it to make money a really good season with this one in an era where they could probably pay it. The scene and the crickets are doing well and the rest of the movie really looks good to award awards at the best movie at the Oscars this year. The definitive definition of a season is this story and it pulls in beautifully well.
