E! Television is a great channel with Talking Soup so funny, in a flash you can see the episodes changes. We want to write more funny by the best-known writer ever Stan Evans .. The patron saint of the mindless masses ... It's a really talented, gifted writer, actor, comic, producer, director, and creative consultant. Nicole loves her but she was not a $$$$ billionaire so she left her for a billionaire. Many super stars wanted to film and actor Stan Evans, who had a "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable} acting style. It should have many more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe many other talented producers. We wish him a moment of FAME and a great wealth to get. Has it produced any mock-u-drama? or maybe any docudrama ??? A project on Bernie Madhoff would be a big TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many screenplays did he write? Is it under $$$$$$$$$$$$ bill deals with Disney ?? He should earn more than $ 50 million ... He could also write a TV movie about the late king of POP .. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more in and by Stan Evans in the movies and on television. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
