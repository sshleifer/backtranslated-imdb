David and Bathsheba are a beautiful Hollywood photo book produced from 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck, King David, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). The film is based on the second book of the German Testament in Samuel in the Holy Bible. He followed King David, who was like a child killed by the giant Goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. A tough king and assured, David however has affairs in the heart that causes serious problems. For once it's spy Bathsheba taking a shower {re; bath}, it's the start of a trip involving adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgment of God is called upon. <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great, enchanting production. From its excellent design to it's positively gorgeous Teknikolor photography {Leon Shamroy}, it has enough quality to guarantee sitting along the best of the genre offered as considering value production. Untypically, this movie is sedately rhythm and relies on 99% of its worth driven purely by dialogue. This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with the villages. This is a very humanist picture, in fact can not be beat around the bush burning here, it's a biblical love story flecked with sin in the heart. But it's not a bad thing at all, because it's down to get it pretty well done {Peck has something stoic yet vulnerable to going on real estate & Hayward is pushing it to the max}, and it's a fine-headed story and knowing skill does not often forget the King Henry. And although some of the dialogue is admitted krangle induced, the character flow never cuts like Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs Muir) Oscar nomination scenario to keep the attention at all. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a picture that opens in the theme of the Bible / Swords & Sandals genres (most likely because it is a talky piece that has the heart as its main selling point), but it's really well worth the time to anyone interested in the most lavish styles. 7/10
