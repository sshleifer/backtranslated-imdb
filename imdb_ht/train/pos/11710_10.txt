Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins would shake the world of the Christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham Evangelization Association has given we are the owner. What I like most about this genre is her incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to this dramatic scene of "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, listening to it in the news because filmmakers can not afford to show it. The first film is located in Pre-Millenial, pre-temptation eschatalogy, believes that Christ comes once and for all to take the secrets of the Church, and then comes again to the end of the seven years of Hell earth. What uses my fear of high junior now makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and his journey through the tribulation (and two of the three film sequels) tell his remarkable story of disbelief and ultimately amnation. I hate admitting it, but I still enjoy watching it. It even has the exact same note of Monty Python and the Grail of God. I think I'm the only person in the history of this observation.
