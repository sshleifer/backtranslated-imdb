* Firstly, although many people say that it is the worst of the series, I do not think it is true, considering this one ideally reflecting 21 year old mental age .it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you At the teenager good times when you would like to have fun as the characters do. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays is not supposed to be for adolescents? I mean ... movies are mostly places for teens to hang out; more, see such a movie during a sleepover or something like that very good for having a very good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of stripping of this movie. Well ... let's get real ... not that reflects the thoughts of teen guy like people from the movie? what would you like to see ... intelligent books, romantic things? this is not at all what should be of these teens teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * To conclude, I think if you are a teenager, you must absolutely see the movie, and even if you are a real grown grown or a woman, you should see it if you still have a teenage idea or you often think about how it was being a teenager, or things like that. Thanks for reading!
