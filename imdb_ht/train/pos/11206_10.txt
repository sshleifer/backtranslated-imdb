I have not seen this film! At least not in its entirety. I saw a few haunting clips that left me gagging to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory that day. A spacecraft (highly convincing) is orbit around the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below it. The moon shines through visibility. . . . and for a few seconds there is it. Line parallel, square, Can it be .. Then the light disappears and the glimpse of short ... that ... has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful thing. I've seen some other clip too, but would like to get the full movie.
