This is the beginning of a new and exciting Star Trek series. It has a "down to earth" -knot of feeling and darker and less "plaggy" senography. Characters need some more time to develop, but they have potential. One of the irresistible things (and all the series of Star Trek really) is that they show such a gloomy picture of the gender equality between men and women in the future by painting a very positive picture of everything else. (Earth stopped wars, hunger etc.) Female characters here are two, subcommander T'Pol who are volcanoes and Communications Officer Hoshi. Hoshi is well wimpy and T'Pol has made a "volcano babe". Some of the crew attitudes feel somewhat too American (as opposed to the more international center of the TNG crew) but creating exciting dynamics. <br /> A very good pilot though for a very good set.
