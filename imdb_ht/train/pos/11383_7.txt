This is a fine music with a timeless note by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a beautiful 'Parisien' atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of a story .. well it's not really there . Or at least, not very well worked out. The act is also not so smooth by Caron. But I love some of the dialogues, I liked the scene of the Seine, I loved the character played by Levant, the colors; and dancing of course, which is quite magnificent. A 7.5 - 8 looks like the point at me.
