Belushi's most ingratiating with Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think Belushi is under-utilized in Hollywood and the role of this film is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV shows, this is a very different and likable character. The film itself is not crushed earth, nor is the new message, but rather it is sweet and endearing. Throwing in the familiar face familiarity with unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although Lovitz's petits can be tedious, and Michael Caine's good spiritual guide has a little disaster if not well-meaning corner. Hamilton, as Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and a wonderful why she is married to her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not very convinced of the "prom queen" who has gone. But a nice way to spend two hours.
