Holy History, (New House) is a terrific horror story. This is from the circle of Fear and the Holy Ghost series in the early sixties. The beginning and end of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember it from the early family series, Family Affairs in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters of the story. I've seen this recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend that you look this. is terrific, there is no gore or curse words but very scary. Barbara Parkins has played the young woman. David Birney has played her husband.Both actors were very good at parties.If you like scary, fun, terrifying ghost story, then you'll love this little gem. I gave this a high rating. I highly recommend this story.
