"Someones at the door". OHHH, How I miss this bad show .. but we are lucky to have "invasion". Thanks, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had it all. If I chose one thing that I loved best about the show, he had to read it "not to draw line-drawn". Favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I worshiped South accents. I bought the DVD asap, and my kids are also fans. There are some hot n stars. There are also some Satan. So if the kiddos will look you may want to edit (fastforward / jump). He has humor, on a Joss Wheedon level, which many show lack. Adult adults and adult situations, are busy and fined. The DVD has some extras, but I hope it has a lot more. If you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show, come see "Indian Gothic"!
