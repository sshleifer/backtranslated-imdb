Well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie I've ever seen. The effects are so bad you just have to laugh, and act, quite admit that it has no melon gibson. But Gary Browning who plays a police officer is so bad damn, it gets good. I do not know how to read it herself to make this movie a 10. You must see it if you're in sinema movies / cinema cause its bloody and funny at the same time. Movie Assassin.
