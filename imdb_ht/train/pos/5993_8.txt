The cure uses voice to create an intense attitude. Despite VO's accounts for the entire movie line, it's amazingly not taking away the visual story. The use of multiple movie action adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color has worked nicely enhancing them in time. The finish will make you jump even though they can anticipate the result. I've especially enjoyed thrill in the movie's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also nice and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but very fulfilling. The correct fix really helps show what a short film can do. Worth watching over once!
