Not sure if it was good or bad, but I read about the other comments before watching the short one. I must say I do not agree with most of the negative comments or issues that have been with it. a first time "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I like to see the things that I can love, not necessarily in the pro, but by people just getting the wet feet like me. <br /> is also out of a first-timer, as I read, I applaud the effort.Marvelous work then in that respect! There was some comment on the music. I thought it was pretty nice for the piece. Some say it kind of droned for a while, but I found that creating blood pressure (us) necessarily being aware of it, and when it pulled out gun and the guitar began crunching rope, it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks, but realized it is just now moving. Yes there is a 180 degree slip / clip in there, but chi * happens. Everyone else saw Hugh's white shirt turned white (near the end of the rain) in "Australia"? See how much and those who were behind this movie! Give the kid a break for God's sake! All in all I think it was very well done. Only 2 things to mention are hardly worth mentioning-Do not walk up to a bright frame frame with the camera, and I would just have appeared splatter at the beginning of the shot at a still shot, so people would not necessarily know what is it. <br /> <br /> My experience so far teaches me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie, it just takes time to learn how to do it, then the time actually does it, and then You better take a few more time to think of all the details you'll need to shoot before calling "post-production time!" IMHO, it seems that the director / writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is the first four of his reports, I would give him an "A". The rest of you reports to the principal's office for a whuppin '.
