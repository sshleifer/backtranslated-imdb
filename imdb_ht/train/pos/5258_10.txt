The ladies man is laughing loudly, with a great variety of castings as well as some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the songs of love as freelance writing ever). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is the usual quality itself in a brilliant side roles. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays a surprisingly stupid guy well and wrote himself some of the funniest lines you will find in any comedy out there. <br /> It is definitely worth a purchase as it watches every 6 months or so will lead to you always laugh as hard as you did the first round. <br /> <br /> I distribute thoughts at this time writing that it has a 4.7 / 10 manners and I encourage you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember the kids- "So more movement in the ocean"
