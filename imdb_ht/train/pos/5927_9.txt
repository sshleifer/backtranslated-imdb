Stephen King Cinema is a fun thing with me. I either really love them or laugh them. Some of the fan productions (such as Desperation and Storm in the Century) I did not enjoy. Some of them are smaller, I really liked. Sleepwalkers are one that I really like and watch it regularly. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, forms of animal creatures that although human beings like to change the appearance of a fade like animals. They are immune to the squat of cats and each time they go to a new city, set out traps to catch and kill animals. When they move to the last city, they need to look for a girl and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but her mother needs food from her hold of her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Charles will spend it or use it to save his mother. Although this story has the incidences of incest that some may find unappealing it actually plays part of the story and therefore is not just plonked in the movie for the sake of scandal. Like most stories, Stephen King is based in a small town with many interesting characters. The act is not the best, neither is the special effect, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'frost' and is very versatile and enjoyable adaptation. <br /> For UK readers: This most recent production has been featured on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror Channels.
