This film is an excellent military film. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation in sacrificing good entertainment accuracy, but this is not the case with this movie. Other reviews have found this movie to be too slow for the tastes, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the movie crew speedfully knowingly telling stories as completely as possible giving the two and nine minute hours allotted. The story itself has been said and retold several times over, but it remains for a professional soldier ?? and an African American in that ?? report the story as presented by the film crew, and as it presented the US Navy in the world. The story of Brashear's work becomes a marine diver, and his life as a marine diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story presented. There is also my story of how Master Chief Petty Sunday Officer challenged the illegal command of his Commander Officer that little Officer 2nd Class Brashear should not pass in his test diving no matter how he did, and pay the price at a loss of one radius and a change in placement. He also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of The broken line ran that would break him into two if Brashear did not push him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth saying, and I'll admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried better to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see a great story saying in such a complete way, and seeing the traditions and honors of the marine preserved in a natural and full way.
