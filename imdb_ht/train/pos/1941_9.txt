I actually thought this is a comedy and sitting watching it hoping to laugh my ass. Very soon became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a 'Jim Carrey kind' one. What keeps us watching was the characters - the movie begins with some pretty angry, troubled people, gathered together to try and fight one of the basic fears - scary of water, afraid of swimming. we start to get bit by bit in their lives, witness problems, guess in their thoughts. <br /> <br /> actually I made it look darker than it actually is, and besides the chain of events soon bring some light and hope into life. <br /> <br /> I probably would not watch the movie I knew it was not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had good time, enjoyed the story and not mind I spent about 90 minutes and li. Many films treat the alienation between people in the western world, this movie shows how people can get together and help each other <br /> "in the light of the dying days you meet him, Do not let it pass you and leave, do not drop it, it is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> 9/10 <br /> Peace and Love
