For anyone who might think that this show is not for them, please give it a try. Network TV has disconnected in shows that clones of clones or fact-based shows are presenting some really real people. This show is a return to family oriented television where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are about, and perhaps even learning a bit about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most active young actors in today's show business, and is perfectly cast as the young, a little naive new batboy for the New York Empire fictional (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storm round out the main cast, and they are all outstanding. This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen. Hopefully he will stick around for a few seasons and we can look for Young Pete (Sumpter's character) to learn and grow.
