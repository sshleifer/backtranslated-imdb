Masayuki Suo, who directed this fine film, is about a role. After the decent "fancy dance" and the classic (in Japan, anyway) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his own track with a successful smashing. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as it is in Suo of the previous films) and really roots for the characters. But my great bonus is the look of this movie to the viewer of Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has a talent to showcase real-life activities and fun flair. The result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into Japan today. Also look for the main actors 8 of Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supported characters (Takenaka) (many).
