An enjoyable Batman animated film. Not on par with "Return to the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but solid however. I liked how the movie keeps you guessing as Batwoman was. There was beautiful twist. Good action sequence. I've always been in the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the horrific Batman live movie action films. The trend continues here. <br /> 7.5 out of 10
