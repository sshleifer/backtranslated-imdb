Jim Henson's Muppets has been my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a kid again. Well, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the frog and friends. The first is that they're trying to get on Broadway in a musical show where else, but New York City. You will see camera by then the New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the light of the gang muppets. The problem with the show is that Kermit goes missing and the gang has to get him to New York City. It's worth looking for kids and even sentimental elders like myself.
