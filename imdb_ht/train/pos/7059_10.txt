I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I had seen on the internet, I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is a very beautiful and funny end for everyone - kids and adults ... like me, i 22 years old. <br /> I also get it with many informative movies, it shows lessons about being true to yourself and your heart. I thought he had great animation, and the voice was very good; songs made by Brooke Allison. Since this movie has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite from the three, is the story of when the Jaq Mouse, has become somebody for a day, thanks to Fairy Fairy and her magic.
