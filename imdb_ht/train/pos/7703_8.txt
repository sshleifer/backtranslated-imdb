I was surprised at how a movie can be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The chicken flying saucer was NEAF beyond understanding, especially when landing, but especially when Krell's attack was scary for a movie that made more than half a century ago! Living in the middle of the East I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggests that Alta should dress more modest, and as an engineer, seized by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreams of the accessory storage. All in all, an entertaining and a half hour, I first saw Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a 'young man'
