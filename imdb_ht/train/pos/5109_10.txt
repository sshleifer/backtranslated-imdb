I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I do not remember anything about the movie. But I remember the sensation she caused from the Gilley and the mechanical bull of Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin 'for love" that always brings back memory from childhood every time I hear it. <br /> However, a few years ago I saw this film for the first time as an adult and all I can say is I was blown away. Some movies hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can. From Bob's home ranch, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's Hall, and Bud and Sissy. And perhaps for that reason it does not have a wider call. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can not stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For that reason I love it!
