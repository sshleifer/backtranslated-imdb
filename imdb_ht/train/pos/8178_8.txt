Not that many films have really exploited the fear going to the dentist that many people have. People in the profession have some intimidating instruments. Give writer Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch to remove maximum-made-your-extreme-in-your-seat shocks in their quotes. Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the trains early on. An obsessive-compulsive imbalance, he begins to dwell on thinking of decay, even imagining it where no, and also equally decay and corruption in society in general. Having witnessed his wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) getting it on with the pool boy, she determined to punish her. At the same time, it's under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. Silver (Earl Boen, better known as Dr. Silberman from the "Terminator" franchise) makes a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth closed on Finney's finances. Feinstone begins to see everyone around him as rotten in one way or another, and he goes on a murder spree as Gibbs detective police (still holding Ken Foree) picking up his trail. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly has great fun with the script. It allows for some really embarrassing and remarkably funny scenes that make just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as a thrilling audience. The script gives the Feinstone character some fine lines of dialogue and is generally quite sly and entertaining, with large pitch-black humor doses (as Feinstone commands a victim of "finding the language out of the way!"). Brooke and I.R.S. silver figures in torture specifically effective. The makeup effects are for the best part. And the movie does a great job of keeping its forward momentum, as Feinstone, and relentlessly driving it for perfection, switching from respected professional to bloody casuals in time files. <br /> <br /> Forever, always cool and fun to look, is rather wasted in a standard-problem detective role, but there's some fun of watching Boen playing his slimeball party in the pig. Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide a very appealing eye candy. With a pre-fame Mak Ruffalo can be seen in a support role. But this is all Bernsen's great show as it sinks in his teeth (forgiving me for using this expression) in its featherweight leader and total conviction. <br /> <br /> The "Dentist" ranks as one of the most original and exciting horror films from the 1990's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
