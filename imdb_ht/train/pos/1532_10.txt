This, like Murder It Wrote, is one of those who show, that after a stress day at school, I sit in front of the TV, and watch. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame it's not about the time anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr. Mark Sloan, a physician-turn-detective, who with his son, resolved murder. He is joined by a very competent but very competent cast cast, namely his real life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that each set of hairstyles has changed. I also loved Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I particularly liked Michael Tucci as Norman, and believed how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so fun, with great guest stars, it's somewhat obvious at times, such as Colombo, but in every episode, there is always something chuckle about. In conclusion, a huge set, with two thumbs and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
