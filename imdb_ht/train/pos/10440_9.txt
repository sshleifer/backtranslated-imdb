This movie is intelligent. That is, much more than most other cinemas, it transcends the least common omnipresent - stupid people probably do not appreciate it. The story also depends heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels lost in translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better. The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely I saw a movie where the script and the current were melted perfectly. The dialogue moves into very personal issues, and the risk of becoming a little over the head. He does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a moment awkward and nasty. Swinging on this fine line requires an incredibly talented actor. Sometimes, it produces great results, and overall this film is simply meaningful! Only very, very rarely the "love" of the movie is shown in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Each time that is realized, the result is fantastic. I think that the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. He always looks stunning in this movie, 12 years later. This is simply a gem in a movie that you can not miss. One of the best movies I've seen in the 1990s!
