I love God where I start. This bar is the best movie I've ever seen. The camera angles are great but in the opinion I act was the best. why the script writers for this movie do not write big budget films I will never understand. Another is the throw. it is great. This is the best Raimi TED film out there for sure. I know some of you out there probably think "there is no way to have much better" but no harm to you. RAPTOR islands are a work of art. I hope he should have goten the best movie of the year instead of that movie crash scam and a bunch of names no AK raptors. I believe that this movie is really the most beautiful thing ever.
