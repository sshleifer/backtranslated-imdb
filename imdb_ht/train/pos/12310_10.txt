Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. Fortunately, the film demonstrates the original spirit very well, though the draw has changed significantly. The movie language, the rhythm, the special effects are all from Hollywood, but still have a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together. The result is pure beauty.
