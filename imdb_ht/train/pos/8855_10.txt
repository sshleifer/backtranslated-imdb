Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest directors, always got toys! A few years ago he fired "Finding Me Guilty", a proof that everyone who gets Diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity with the right director. If he retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he's still strong, his next movie is already announced for 2009. But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, the performance of the teeth. The little nuances of their performance, the "real" dialogue and / or the evolving situation throughout the film are just amazing. The (time) structure of the film, which keeps your toes the whole time, combines time-line so seamlessly, that the correction looks natural / impeccable. The story increases, though even in a "normal" time structure, it would have been at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! : o)
