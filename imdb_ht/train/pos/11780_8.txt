This is a documentary I've come across by chance on the UK TV TV UK More4 and I said I found it very interesting and intrusive. I will also seek the book that has been the source material for this documentary. Basically this is Jarred Diamond's theory of why some parts of the world's society go well with others. The argument he presented was my new and discussed how fortune in the right crops and the right animals where domestic servants can be certainly a compelling one. As for the documentary itself it's well injected and well reported and not many of the re-created scenes that spoil many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps by being censored that is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message from the masses. The people claiming his theory is Marxist but I do not buy this and see it more sociologist geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of society not based on religion. Very recommended look.
