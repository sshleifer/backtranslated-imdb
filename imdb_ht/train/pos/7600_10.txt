After being fully addicted to Six Feet Bottom, I did not think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding! I absolutely love this show and can not turn it off. Wealth of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful environment are all amazing. I totally and fully tuned. I do not know how the creators do it, but each character touches me deeply. I feel happy, pain, everything, right down to my core !!! I have no cable so I've leased the set on Netflix. When I put it on I watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. I can not wait for the next disc to arrive in my home. This is probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
