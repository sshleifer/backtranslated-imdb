Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and succeeding. Not only in his goal, but also in making a beautiful movie, especially visually. It knows how to use boiler, slow-motion sequences, tracking vaccine, technical vaccine, etc. in a nice way, smooth. This gives the movie a very relaxing feel of it. The story is about the lives of 8 different characters that have nothing in common except one thing: a party that they all go through, which is also the vault of this movie. The beauty of this picture lies not in the question of how the characters have effect on eachother (in comparison with a similarity, of course best film like Magnolia). I simply do not think that was the idea of ​​the bartender. The beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through to make or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling these small stories that describe little experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. The soundtrack of the film is excellent, but not a surprise as we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his bandwagon. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing that contributes to the sun, smooth feel of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop / rock-melody that gives some scenes of strength. Only one flaw, and that's the last half an hour. Was it the exit, which broke me? Or are not the recent scenes that are cool and accurate than the scenes until then? I can not figure it out ... <br /> All in all a beautiful Sunny movie that lifts the Belgian movie to. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <It's the breeze that leaks to a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon to make it even more beautiful; it's the cool breeze that makes you relax when it passes you to a crowded part when someone opens the door; it's the breeze that brings the perfume from which beautiful girl is sitting next to you in the park that you just met a week ago; it's the breeze .....) <br />
