I would not dare say this movie is better than the original, but it is very good at its own right. The comedy of this movie is just as good as the original though, there are many scenes that get me laughing just about them. The story of this movie is even more rare than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this movie with a great cast. The core thrown out of the original film returns to the characters of this movie and performs a fantastic job and their role. I do not care what someone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed her portrait of Ted in both of these films as I did Bill Alex Winter. I was very pleased to see George Carlin return to Ruffus role, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays part of Ted Logan's father doing a really good job. The scene where Ted owns his ancestral body and Hal London Jr. begins to act like Ted is a great scene, and pulls it to impressive assets. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as death, he completely made the movie for me. The rest of the cast is quite as good. <br /> If you liked the first installment of the series Bill and Ted, then I would hope that you would like this movie as well. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> -Chris
