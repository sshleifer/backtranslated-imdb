Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and will see what I expected a great disappointment. Instead I got a movie that perfectly illustrates irony, humor, elvance, and above all else the sadness to break into Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best preformance Nolte date. It captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr. still out of the subtle intonations of his speech in the water held back behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunted at his detachment in reality as Cambell's lover youth. John Goodman is understated and more effective than "Blue Fairy Tied" in the Kanbell. This story of Pinnocioesque in Cambell is trying its own ideal hero and unwittingly to become its true realistic tragedy it is a mature look and stay alive in what we are as people. And so on, it is one of the most deeply romantic films I've ever come across. Cambell is the incarnation of both love and wisdom wisely. And in the films sastifyingly painful conclusions, she finally learns what it means to be a real boy as Blue Girlfriend's Fairy she grants his wish. And he realized that ... well, watch the movie and you will see. Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever performed. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep into our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
