This movie is really naked racking Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was good always! Michael Rooker puts on a surprising performance with John Lithgow playing an excellent mechanic! The music is especially the theme! The movie is action packed and never dull! a Stallone fan then watch Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
