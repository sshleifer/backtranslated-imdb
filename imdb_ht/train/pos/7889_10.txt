Freddy's movie's dead end nightmares are just as terrible and disturbing as all other nightmares on Elm Street, yes he has comedy senses on it, so there are all the other films, but how anyone can possibly say that you would not find Freddy Krueger afraid, if you came across this man in your dream you would not find him even more scary with a comic sense on him because his comedy shows he does not care at all about your death that it finds it very funny, and Freddy also plays funny mind games with them, which in its own way are very disturbing, using his funny way I think to make movies to horror movies on elm these streets today, The very clever writers make Krueger funny and scary as opposed to Jason Vorhees, who did not say anything and he did not have the real scary of his victims, this movie is about as good as Freddy's understanding becomes and I would recommend it's anyone who has a sense of humor and not how "does not fall asleep!".
