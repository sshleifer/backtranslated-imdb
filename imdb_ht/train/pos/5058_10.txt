There should be more movies about our native Americans. I especially think that using actual real native Americans, would be the right thing. I know that Archie Belaney, who was played by Pierce Brosnan, has done an excellent job of showing that character, since she was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to put more Indian Americans in their role, and never use anyone else. The Sioux nation put on the burner back too long. Because of their being a shame in our country. It is my firm belief that our country should return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their land to the Arabs, but we have no effort to do the same, we should be disappointed. We must practice what we preach!
