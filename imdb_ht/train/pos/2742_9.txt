Richard Brooks's excellent 1967 film at Truman Capote's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece for Oscar's performance Oscar Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2005 CAPTURE. They really play well together (try on separate nights). It is strange to get films made 38 years apart so mesh. These two are really improving with each other. Though different actors play their role in killer Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces mix well. Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks's films are weaker, as they give him a different name then Capote. I would suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN Cold Blood. It does for a powerful experience!
