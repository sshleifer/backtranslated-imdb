The very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in the early morning morning mist, and I thought: "This is almost too nice." And it goes on like this: The landscape of flowers and animals that looks like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her dad's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This might seem outdated and escapist, but it suits a story that is itself in silent beauty, happening on the borders between life and history, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of her. The extreme parsimony of the movie, having a simple, slow story, just one actor and hardly any special effect, exercises a strong magic. That is why I find it discouraging that this parsimony is given up in the last minute, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown woman, and her son) are introduced. Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring a pop-song song along with the glory of French mountains. I went to the movie together with my two little girls, but I recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of movie. Obviously, not everyone does.
