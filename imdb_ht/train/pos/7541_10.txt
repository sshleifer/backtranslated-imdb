This showtime movie truly deserves a better rating rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10-based story and act of the two stars. After reading the viewer reviews, I was surprised at how many people expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah, I see that IMDb list as Comedy / Drama under Genre. That is certain is deceiving, is not it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before you entered this website so I did not have that hope. In fact, based on the Summary of what I hear, I fully expect it simply to have a Drama. I wonder if the disappointment in this was not a comic movie that caused lots of low votes. Another factor that could have been caused to voting is that this film is a lot of 'character-driven'. 'Miss Daisy Driving' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes in mind. A previous person's comment complains about a boring judgment. Tom (Danny Glover) scene performances seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how was he riding in social riding in his family - or his personal troops, if you want. However, they have been used to establish credibility and justification as their right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' to the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's mania became a constraint. It proved that it would stop at mixing nothing in the white neighborhood. His grief when another black man moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represents; Tom was left behind. In essence, Tom became an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but white on the inside. <br /> <br /> Last 20 minutes in this movie are among the most powerful, directed and acting writers (by Whoopi Goldberg). I have never had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the highest point of the movie was not evident event that happened next door (not willing to give it away). The highest score is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not sure if it is the conversation when it informs Tom who is Tom's college-who is going to or when he's released, all in the night and Tom wakes up. But the denial is great. You know that life on this street will never be the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
