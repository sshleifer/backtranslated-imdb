I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is a bit different from it; The fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Did you read a single word in Austen's writing, I really can not compare this to any of his work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue is intelligent, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the largest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh very loud, with perfect British material and verbal. Each current performance is spot-over, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a quality controller. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. I found a couple of them very disappointing, however, and while I think at least some of what was meant to be funny, it tends to repeat too, and it honestly was not the first fun to appear. The correction and cinematography are beautiful, and everything looks gorgeous. Draw and rhythm are great, you are never bored. It ends in a * really * obvious way, but maybe that's the audience of those preferences. I can not claim that this did not entertain me, he did from start to finish, and I would watch it again. There is a bit of that. I recommend this to any fan of romance history. 7/10
