After reading the original I thought it would be more difficult to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann puts in a once-off great performance as Montreal Gar, the suppressant antagonist who manages openly on screen by extrasting his (but inviting for others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs" with inability to communicate his feelings that match only Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth leasing out if you can find it. (Probably Available Outside Ireland & UK)
