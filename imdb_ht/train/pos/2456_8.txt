When I went to watch this movie my expectation was really low, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think I was going to watch a boring teen-flicker movie, but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the act was a bit compelling - especially in Melville who really showed her talent in this movie, and scenes in the battles - for a low budget film - very well done. <br /> I think that this film deserves a wider audience than it has received. It's a movie, which can be seen in the whole family - maybe not the least of kids, since it has some rather rough scenes. A movie about love, and the issues that can happen, when you go against your family tradition. <br /> Yes, the movie is very much like "bend it like Beckham", but I actually think this movie pulls it better.
