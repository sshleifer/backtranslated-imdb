High Massage is about a boy called Marty. She was harassed, she was chosen from high school. A group of kids played several pranks on it, and these lifts were really bad. The last plague ended tragic. <br /> The linoleum 5 years later. The kids gang up again for a reunion. One puts it in old high school. The school is now abandoned, and they have to break in. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but says they go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> They start to party, and look at their old lockers, and they see something in Marty's. A girl feels sorry for Marty, but another quiet guy goes down. One time kill them to start, it is great. Each kill is creative and gory. We see a figure in a jester mask, hunting one by one throughout the school. It appears Marty is back to precise revenge. After the death of the first, they are locked in the school. They start looking for a way out. Now there are a number of logical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5-year meeting. Second of all, after the first kid dies, a girl gets over all over her. They all ran to a panic, yet ran into the bathroom, and found a tub. Hrr's friend just killed, and she decided to take a bath! Most importantly, why is there a basin in a school bathroom. Anyways, the tub does not seem to really work .... and it's a terrible death this is a 80s movie. it is a horror slasher. WHO cares if he has some logic. I would not do that for one. This film has really great death. Finish .... have a twist. Having recently seen High Blood Pressure, I can compare the two. The only way the same is that there is a twist, which kind of let me desi ..... after that the twist, comes a great, if not the best kill, in the movie. /> After the last kill, the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to end the movie. It was me going "wow ..."
