I watch this movie all the time. I watched it with families ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; They all love it. It really shows the true scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. <br /> It's great for thoes who love comedy movies, films are jerker, or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the spectacular creatures, the scenes are really thought out, and the characters are perfect. What I love about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personality: Shadow (The oldest, a Golden Retriever) It is the wise one, filled with wisdom and the attitude of any dog ​​lucky (The Indian Bulldog Puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the funny character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan Cat) It's the real cat that shows what a real cats will do for the owners, a girly one's real one.
