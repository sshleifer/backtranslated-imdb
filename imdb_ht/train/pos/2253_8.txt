I rent this movie because of my interest in American history, and especially the story a bit weird in Mormons. This movie tries to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith can turn his "vision" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the Mormons issues in the rules of Navuoo, Illinois. It presents Joseph Smith's judgment. In this trial course, Brigham Young stands to say in his conversion to Mormon, and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is killer, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he chose to lead the Mormons to a new country. Despite its serious doubts, it endures, and finally there is a vision (which Utah is the place for his colony) to give him confidence in the goodness of his leadership. Later, as the crops destroyed by locusts, he was still skeptical that he really chose - however, a miracle occurs, which surely places it in history. <br /> I found performance to be moved, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would like to know whether Mormon believes that this is an accurate painter. Polygamy is a part of the story, but this is central to LDS's not raised. The problem does not emphasize that. <br /> I'm the person who is away from this movie because of his religious subjects, but he has a great cast and will keep your interest at all.
