I'm not tired of saying this is one of the best political schools ever to do. The story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it deals with murder in Kennedy. A real and honest district lawyer (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by a single Derlow man (= Oswald) and even though all other officials wanted to close the case he continued investigating his team a. <br /> <br /> The scenario is written tightly and fast and keeps the tension until the end. Just the part to deal with the Milgram experience about authority is (though not refreshing) somewhat out of place. The finish sequence - explains who Icarus really is - partly in motion slowly and intensified by a band Morricone is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
