This is far more than the good story of old age people discovering the pleasures of dance parlor (although it is that as well). The story of one who learns to love life again, pushes past all the pressures of work and money to discover happiness once more. The bonus of this movie is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing moods of modern Japan toward everything from dance to physical contact salon. There are scenes that will make you laugh loudly ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many other places you'll just feel good. great introduction to Japanese contemporary cinema for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
