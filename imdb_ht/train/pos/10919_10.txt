Five mortal venoms are not as bloody and violent as stories of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it presents some of the best-handed-but sequel fighting in Hong Kong's film story. Director Chang Cheh created what is considered by many to be its chief. This film launched five career makers. Meng Lo plays again another bad ass. It would go on to be at super ninja. Kuo Chui is Philip Kwok going to the story of Ricky and Hard Burn. Any fan socky hood can be this appraisal. But I still think it is not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But all cutting skill is a good thing and this is one of the best.
