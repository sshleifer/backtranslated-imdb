I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I mean that they have done for each other, which in a lot of moments in the movie we want them to die for each other. The stories are what we've ever wanted and probably most of us never happened. This is about love, but not as stupid as in "mountain huts" or those types of films. This is life and I believed in them, I believed they were falling ... This was so clever and touchy. I just finished seeing it a minute ago and I still have ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. <br /> I must say I was now becoming menthol and felt as if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some time, something could come true. <br /> I'm French and did not know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her other work because she looks like an angel and she got a good thing. <br /> I saw "before sunset" (late in Paris) a few days before I saw "before sunrise" and they did not matter. They are both chefs. proof that you do not need to impress the eyes and technology to get the most feeling. I'm sorry for my English which I'm trying best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
