Small SPOILERS alert !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say that myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of its films are below average action films such as Warrant Death and Gun. This was one of his first films, and perhaps he should continue to make horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinates me. Good achievement, see no famous actors or big budget involved. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the mythical Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous Broker Stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. She explains Dracula Roemjan County's life and how she scared the Turkish army by spearing dead corpses before her castle. Of course, is where the reality and "based on a true story" stop. Drinking blood and everything was invented by Bram Stoker. In this film, the county (Vlad Teppish) emigrated to the USA and seduced tons of women. And they are all beautiful girls, I'll give it to him. In general, good acting is not gender, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. This film is really unknown and hidden on the darkest shelf in my local videostore. But it certainly is worth cleaning up the dirt on the lid and put it in the VCR. Heck, it's a lot better than the famous movie Nicole Kidman and the same title. These two films have nothing else in common, but I blame the movie for stealing the attention away from this cute little picture. Check it out ... my humble opinion to die for = 8.5 / 10
