A boy and a girl were chased by a local warrior because the boy was killed (not crashing) the mighty warrior (or anyone he was). And they travel to the nature of the most ruff Africa. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is not that good (except for kid elephant). But it is a very good adventure and it's not very censored, some blood, meat and naked (which lighten up the movie a bit). <br /> I give this movie a 7 because of its photograph in African nature and its actions.
