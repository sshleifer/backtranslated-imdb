I am surprised that many viewers have more respect for the end of this brilliant film ... I've seen all the guinea pigs and this one is much easier. Even though I saw the "iron", I still have doubts when watching these 35mins of pure turtle: it's powerful. A 10 out of 10 because this movie is perfectly accomplished that it set out to be: The best movie movie ever has to do.
