A great movie that requires an acquired taste. If you're in action, Wham Bam movie and hate so much love then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like sitting in front of a good smart movie now and again I recommend this very very. The easiest movie that is produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> Only the other American movie I would give 10/10 to be Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then he comes second this masterpiece.
