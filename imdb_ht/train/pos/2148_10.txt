I always look for this film when it's on TV. Have them get the DVD I guess. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. It is so original but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with wonderful dancing. Unfortunately we never got the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make the perfect end if they had. But I guess he left it to your imagination what could happen. <br /> A very simple and innocuous story. He remained loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> I have not seen the Hollywood rumor. Not if I want. I do not really enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere has more to match the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the renewal is not as simple and innocent.
