"Maybe we can arrange to meet." "Where are you now?" "I sit in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt that?" "If you were in your office now we'd have to face this face-to-face conversation." Bourne stays hard, and elusive. Only his penile resistance led the film a little too far into fantasy. Conversation is macho, to the point and only bond of Bond Bond humor. It's all about the action. <br /> <br /> Feel that there is something going on to another level in the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys well. A set of scenes from Waterloo and a Guardian journalist make this great effect. There is no world meeting - you are in it or just a useless body. If the unstable cam does not annoy you too much, enjoy this movie and hope to somehow keep the franchise going.
