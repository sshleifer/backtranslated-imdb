This can be the only movie that actually comes close to capturing on the world's film essentially unapproved of American college experience in the late 60s-early 70s. Go ahead, the name of another movie that even approaches this one: "Getting Right"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Returning to the Seven Secaucus" has its moments, but that's a retrospective film (self-obsessed) person who is more than a movie about a time and a place that shows * at that time and place. "Driving, she says" shows - with subtlety and nuances where it should be, with a quick kick in the shorts where the only appropriate way - the anti-broth movement, ambiguity at high-time college sports (especially when there's a war on), the sexual revolution of the period, and the general inequality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. The whole cast deserves congratulations (as the director, of course), but particular praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero very unusual - except for this time - love interest. William Tepper, as well as the lead, also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capture at student-athlete in the period and to actually play real college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in the "Tall Story" Yikes! ) In all classes, a classic of a kind - and a recent one films now in the 6th grade should write comments about ("boring", "repel" - um, right, sonny, please go back to your Arnold movies ). Why is not this movie available in IMDB?
