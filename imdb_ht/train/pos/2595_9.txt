Brilliant adaptation to the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick to recreate the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double intended intent! Bravo director Strick, senator Haines, as well as director of casting and cinematics in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass' novel, the filmed film drumming by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another fine fine film in the interior monologue that I favorably compared to Strick's film. While there are clearly recognizable Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the movie, there are also recognizable characters, although with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives turns out to be a then major surgeon to Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film for all its excellence has made even the richest of additional look. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
