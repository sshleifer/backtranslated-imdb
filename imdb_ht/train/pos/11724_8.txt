Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After finding that his aunt had left some things, Elvira went to England to choose him, hoping he would have some money. But in her horror, Elvira finds that all her aunt leaves her is her house, her dog and a book. Elvira decided to settle in the house anyways, but and seems to hit black with stunning features, he will not be able to live peacefully. All the neighbors now turn the whole city against it, and Elvira's outrageous attitude and looks, everyone is best looked out, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to look to find Elvira in all these adventures, it's just great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, sure, it's funny and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
