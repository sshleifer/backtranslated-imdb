I'm a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and when I first discovered this movie and watch the trailer, I just think this one is funny. After a while waiting time, I look at it last here in my comment .. I think everyone knows the storyline and will not mention it, instead of reading my first applause to act, generally that Japanese movies have not received brilliantly and acting. Find throughout the cast The MoonChild is simply wonderful and up to it, especially Gackt reflecting his character's emotions and changes very well, dear to his scene both dramatic and funny, as for HYDE party, his acting is good, but he deliberately remained in the background as an actor, respectively as his character, in the whole movie.I did not like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors, but due to little budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewelry The movie is story.It has some cheesy moments but it's OK for me, and the theme The friendly film of the film is really well developed and touched at times, on the other hand the story points out a cruel world with no guaranteed life and some memorable death scenes it reflects this visual theme. An interesting side by side, this movie There are some similarities with Vampire's excellent vampire films that are also played by the most beautiful (beautiful, beautiful) actors in American cinema, actually Moon Children can somehow be seen as brothers and Interwiew, yet original on their own It's just the problem that MoonChild is it's a slow downhill sometimes, I'm a Japanese movie fan and I use that but it does not change MoonChild has some useless scene or character. But all of all; This film is really good and very emotional at times, as for my duo actors / musicians I hope to see other movies in the future, and I recommend this to everyone who likes vampires-action-sci-fiction and movie romance 8/10
