Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It is so addictive that you could play it for hours on hours to stay for a break. I beat the game 4 times, but I never got all the 120 stars ... (I've gotten 111) ... but I hope to achieve them eventually. Though I did not officially play this game until I was seven, I loved watching my sister play it. Now I am 13 and still play this, delete games and start over again. The graphics are incredible for an early N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. Levels are difficult, but not impossible. Battle Bowser are tough. <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why do not you just get it for yourself? Put the X-BOX 360, PS3, and the Wii away and go find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
