Well, first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! First - This movie was meant to be in 3D stereoscopic. It is for the most part, but every time the main character is in his car the movie fell 2D flat! What !! !!!!! It's not that hard movie in a car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. There are a lot of things that are wrong with it. <br /> <br /> TWA - Why are they all showing their death at the beginning of the movie! He made the movie suck every time he was going to get killed !!! Watch it for a good laugh, but do not waste time you buy it. Just download it or something for cheap.
