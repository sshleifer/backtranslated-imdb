This movie has everything you want from a movie action. Blast, shootouts, bad guys and guys got worse. It is fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the problem he has gotten himself off since he steals 12 million dollars from the ultimate great boss "skipper .. this sound cheese .Of course, I was delighted to watch this movie.It is a lot all better than all direct to DVD waste that has been done nowadays. If you can find on the funny scheme than you will find that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. You can discuss twists that they were predictable. But the fast speed in this movie does not give you time too much to think of, which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. But more on the journey the moment Only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why many have hated this movie .. They probably expect a movie about mobsters In place of some dual crows cross one another.
