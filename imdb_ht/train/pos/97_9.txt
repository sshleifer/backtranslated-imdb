This was a favorite Christmas special that I wish they'd released on VHs or DVD, since I lost 33 RPM, and any tape I had made them go away. <br /> I'm not even a big John Denver fan but it was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites and a muppet spin (esp Little St Nick!) He also has some known songs (original? ). He did at the end of the '70 show that there was a timeless feel of it. Hope to get a copy soon !!!
