Deathtrap runs as a play in a movie about who did what people, as it mostly takes place on a set. The first is that a dramatic author is accomplished, whose star has fallen, receives a magnificent manuscript of an ex-student and plans to protect him, and appropriately play it, in (loud) the protests of his wife. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. Skiping the half mark, Deathtrap starts throwing into twists and surprises that turn its properties on itself, then right around, and then in a mad turn, all the time keeps the title proper. It's an excellent mystery film soaked in wit. Michael Caine, as a dramatic author, plays herself in this movie - a brutally a little bit and dramatic. No surprises here - it does its normal job. He becomes the best line in Deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly powerful performing play of the ambitious (and psychopathic) teenage playwrights. She also gets into her very tone body, which she must have retained from the superman movie. Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie in one of my favorite comedy - Off Off. It also turns into a game as well, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They together with funny veterans Carol Burnett, Jan Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Aliens). Together, they demonstrate the plagiarism of cast beds and crew play. On the surface, the film seems to be mostly slapstick but on watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one catch look. Watching this underrated movie was available on DVD.
