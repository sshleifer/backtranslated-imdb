"It was not me! It was, he, my brother, Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when confronted on being in Sally's place. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has yet to believe it, though). This film is one of the best ever for absolute fun and nonbelieveability. Steven Oliver was perfect for the Dugan party, so much that he was in the "Malibu Beach" 1978 as the same character (by almost many screen times, though). "No one called Dugan a turd!" Is another line of age. This classic movie was definitely worth the cost of admission.
