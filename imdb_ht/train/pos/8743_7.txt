A good movie with strong performance (especially of driving). The film is about two Indian girls who are caught up to 6 kilo's hero on an airport in Thailand. They are both cast in jail and one of them sign a confession. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get out there. All you have to do is find a Nick Park that puts the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. So far for the story that is not original (it has a lot of resemblance and the best return of Paradise). Photography acting with the beautiful Newton Thomas Sigel makes this film worth to look. A 7 out of 10.
