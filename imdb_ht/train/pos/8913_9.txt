This is my favorite classic. He filmed a little west of Philadelphia, NOT when I was 13, in 1957, and released the next year. Then in 1970, I found myself working the same county as a rookie state trojan. I always enjoyed checking out the different places where the scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and had a road sign out ahead of saying all vehicles than that was the "house of the patty." The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Forge Park Valley and still shows film today!
