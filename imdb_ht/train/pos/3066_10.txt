Everyone is either love or hate this movie. I'm going with love. It is so good to shoot and thus act wisely. Beautiful. This film is for people who appreciate well-crafted film making. If you're not a fan of well-filmed movie you would hate that. But if you love themselves in acting, photography, history and development, look no further then here.
