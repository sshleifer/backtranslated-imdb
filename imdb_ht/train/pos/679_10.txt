This supernatural Peter Weir Goss is really one of the most haunting and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best performances here as Australian lawyer defending a group of Aboriginal youth accused of murder. As he gets closer to the case, he explains more about the main defendant, Chris, and he's not at least on himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, who appears to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary heavy rains seem to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy coming in the last Wave, one of which will drown the world. <br /> <br /> Sequence of dreams and supernatural effects to enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in their support role, as well as the chap and the hard name that play Charlie, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The highest point and the finish is not disappointed, in contrast to many other supernatural scandals that fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a badest quality. It is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of stunning visual drama.
