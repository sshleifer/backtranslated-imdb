I think the reason for all this diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. No one cares when the Golden Girls sit around eating cheese and discussing their first orgasm, but seeing a menopause postmenopause getting nimble happy while driving I guess is just too much for some to handle. Let's face it, it looks good, it's light years younger than my mother at the same age! It's not an Oscar or a classic classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century at all spectators looks like: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell who helped give way to this end. Fans of the first movie want to see more of the ice queen ice cream. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and Art Direction have been lush and morning and make me want to move to Britian for sure. The score is amazing too. <br /> Make sure there are some overacting in some characters but there's some brilliant work from David Morrissey that's virtually unknown. There is a setback in which the script is usually the same as the first movie only plugged into a psychiatrist in place of the cop. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA forcing the movie to be cut even more that takes away the culprit-raunchiness that the story is known for. At the very least it's fun and fun to look at it, and that's just the movie's intention. So if you had beef and mizz stone, maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusion before you spew out your projectile?
