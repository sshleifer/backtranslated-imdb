The absolute summary of this dancer Douglas Circus (born Detlef Sierck), Writing on the wind force our cautious attention to every movement frame. From its earliest opening sequence, with the leaves blowing in the baronial hostel in a Texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback, the compressed film of its 99 minutes all the family's intrigue of such gas Later, little screen knockoffs as Dallas, Dynasty and Crest Falcon over their long run. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is an American theme, in our dollar-based corporation, to get invincible. Brothers and Sisters Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are worse, inherited troubled oil fortunes in adrenaline; Dog Boy Rock Hudson and New York Lauren Bacall brides are lucky aliens who try to keep the cover on the roiling pan. (It was rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann's wedding in Reynolds's tobacco money.) As always, the misfits found all the mill scenery - and the best spit lines out (Malone, in his Oscar-nabbing performance as Nymphomaniac Narrator and a john for Hudson, to detonate a whole fireworks display in them). Hudson, while good, can not compete with all this emotions-over-head; Bacall starts out strong but growing resessive, only a scheme convenience. There are no problems; with a succession of set-injected pieces of morning tones, Circus provides an object lesson in how to turn out melodrama overwrought set in the lush consumer paradise in the late-50s America. Nobody ever did it better.
