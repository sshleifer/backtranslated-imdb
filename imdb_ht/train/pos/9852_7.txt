No day spent without a new movie released animated film, so we now really have the chance to see more than some nice effects. After viewing ice age I felt that in it was not great impact on me than some other films in this genre. <br /> But it's because I'm a Big Guy right now, and I'm pretty sure this is a very enjoyable movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the "actors" are funny in a beautiful way, without any bit or complex humor. Even the "wrong" is beautiful, fluffy cat and these funny teeth. And the story has a happy end, which was a tiny disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are ending extinction in a sad way), but something great for kids. And apart from some nobody fights (not even when it gets stomped off by a mammoth, several times), made a cartoony feel. <br /> <br /> Part of computer animation is beautiful but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feel scene, when you feel like walking in a beautiful painting or page in a funny. [That's a lot of work anyway!] There were some gags that made me smile - I accepted, the creators tried to satisfy these grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) best left unnoticed, since It does not feel fit in the story. <br /> <br /> In general it's a beautiful movie, but it's instead of the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-Disney Disney cliche. If you do not hate cute animals to make funny things, look at it at least once.
