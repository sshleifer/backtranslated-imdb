This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He was very good acting by Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The camera is excellent, the correction is about as good, and it contains a great original note that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, it took a lot to beat godfather, but the fantastic movie appeared to wager this competition. Definitely a better photo candidate in my book.
