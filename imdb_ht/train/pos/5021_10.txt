I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired some talent first prizes to make a good thrill with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Power Booth and Paxton both deliver good performance. The story is said in an interesting way with both 20 year back flakbacks, then the spot's spot alternating back and forth. This style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can not get dull. Bill Paxton, please make movies more horror, you have the talent for it!
