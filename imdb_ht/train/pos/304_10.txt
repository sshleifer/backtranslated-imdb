I watched him a few years ago. I remember it as a very mysterious situation, with a mix of melancholic things, like the fate of Dorothy and the personal avenue of Bogdanovich. <br /> I turned to look at my VHS copy and then I reviewed it more and more. Nowadays I wait for the DVD version, at any price, please! Country music and easy to listen very well choose from the very first, a bit of blue, but also happy. /> <br /> All the characters are great to me, and funny situations, great acting and a lot of dialogues that have turned this as a movie to my cult and a lot of people I've met online or movie theater. This may not be crashing. <br /> I think the title is a lifetime hope! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> I know that this can be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is that I love it so much, I think that film is labeled me and I ' will never forget it.
