Twisted, bizarre, breathtaking, and hilarious! I could not stop laughing watching this movie. Darren Stein presents movies on the growing family of Cameroon in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a bookmaker rebirth and motivation for her and the skills to manipulate for the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, however we do not all watch the movie to be manipulated in one way or another? From the beginning I was amused in the fact that the boys in the movie seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. And Darren commented on its invincible inversion, and you can see it in the suggestions (great suggestions!) In flamboyance at an early age. Maybe it was just hot Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who grew up in a nurturing environment, it's great to see that his parents support and love him, and that his friends seemed to be enthralled and his talent came behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put The Camera On Me" offers a look back at the 80's intact by commercialism. You will remember the hair, the music, and the mods. I'm the same age as Mr. Stein, so the trip back to the memory line was welcomed. Solo lip-synced dancing number is priceless, strengthened by Frankie going to Hollywood T-shirts. <br /> <br /> These films deal with black themes in time. Child abuse, Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasies, and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely countered, and the Stein Stein contract with these subjects is interesting to say the least, and hilarious view. <br /> <br /> Look at your earliest convenience!
