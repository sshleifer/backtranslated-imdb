Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Back to Thursday is not any good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone loved the Return of Thursday until someone in a movie Kevin Smith made a negative comment on him. Now, everyone in a sudden suddenly looks at you as you have some kind of illness if you mention how much you like it. This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. This movie is fun! It's just as awesome as I remember it was when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's views! It's not correct! <br /> And that Ewok singing in the end has led! I bet you do not even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will put you on fire!
