I had to admit, I did not wait a lot to go to this movie in my Japanese movie, but this film really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job with the title of his movie, truly portraying a picture of madness. I think the fact that this movie silently adds to the resemblance of madness, helps the viewer to experience the inner world characters rather than the world out there. This film just adds to my feelings about alien films vs. Americans, in which the alien films work more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy movie still with the happy ending, exercise imagination very much.
