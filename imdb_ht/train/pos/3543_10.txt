I will not try to speculate as that Brando has tried. At best it turns into these oddball performances, insinuating many things at once, that it does not seem like it does much as it plays by instinct instincts. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored facial features of all others, a concentration that, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as it turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of affairs, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz is so nice to realize, seems prepared for him, which is beginning with odd, and odd still in the end, because everything he does is Brando, has managed a favor perhaps all his own, but a complete grace - yet, odd, coming out of a limited musician actor, never before or after associating with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also weird cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly just right-appropriate, really succulent in the Havana sequence, and never less enjoyable at all. But ... maybe because the actors are both so focused on what they are doing, and characters about what it is intended for each other, there are not seem to the lovers' "chemistry" brought up further insistence than once. Brando / Sky Masterson and Simmons / Sisters Sara respectively eat one another well enough, but I do not see more than that. In this film is dazzling and fun (and most everything on it, craft-wise, is just that - dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but many would rely on chemistry true! One, at least partial, the transformation of the characters in these chemistry, would lend something positively to move to the final stage. As it is, one leaves this movie certainly happy, but not really moved, except in a way to neglect too clear in the union. Sister Sara's commentary marries her missionary uniform, Sky Masterson at herself even-over-town rather than weddings. And they have changed back to people from previous scenes! <br /> <br /> Easy enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and the more serious, the scene, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as the Sinatra / Nathan Detroit Doll, Adelaide, the only scene where These two are only together, not least because it is just no hint of flirtation between them though it takes place in the dressing room Adelaide while Adelaide is about to change. Even if one can submit no place, heaven really is the type of "check out" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He even said Adelaide Nathan will not meet her in hiding. Adelaide and the sky are both true in their respective ways in Nathan, even pessimistic in him, as is demonstrated in a tone of their trades. Adelaide is of course frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is diminished by feeling deeper for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can not love a man and then wants her to be someone else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Since both the compulsive gambler and the rescue seekers are more or less unknowingly despairing, there may just be a dark secret behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry. After all, these shortages may well indicate an excess of narcisism concentration (echoed by the Sinatra / Blaine couple, though with considerably less self-deception involved), which could explain the odd Brando and Simmons', rather provoking, interpretation in heaven Masterson and Sister Sarah. I realize Simmons can be mostly described frowning and doubt, but Brando, though playing to confront it, is not exactly warm and crave, and is more than keeping its distance - it's also to assimilate it, keeping its balance in it. His confidence is to simply play against him - the trip to Cuba, a kiss, whatever he takes - but he does not actually put on winning his seduction so much as to beat him then in his own turf. This can be cunning, as the wing may be the only way to get to the missionary, and to. But it does transition to the Sky from simply trying to win a bet actually wanting Sara Brown a little less than compelling. But why does he want it? What falls in love mean Sky? I find the only way to get around this is not really accepting the humanity he has pursued in, and that he does not want to finish one setting toward Sister Sarah, so he does, as he promised, needs to save people sinning their prayers, making good by his "marker," as it puts it, as a way to get it back when it seems he's just got lost. But this always means self-esteem more than anything. However, it also allows Sara Brown's self-esteem, as Sky will place the missionary in it in order to get back the lover. Neither, at least it seems, will change significantly by the unions, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. But that would seem a whole proposal, but exhausting: the acceptance is still quite a crying away to achieve happiness in the other, let alone the addictions each seem to mean by "chemistry." And behind all this, I suspect is to know Mankiewicz to everyone. <br /> For all those who would say, in the defense of guys and dolls again, not much can be expected from musical in depth style, I need to just remind them the Cabaret, the Three-Piece Opera, Carousel, It's a Star-born, even the Sound of Music, which I do not care for as much (and someone can keep adding to this list without even coming forward-to-musical music), all gorgeous music wrap and dance around stressful concerns.
