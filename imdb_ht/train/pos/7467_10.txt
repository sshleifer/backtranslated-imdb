David Aames is a wealthy guy who lives in New York City. When her 'sleeping partner' Julie Gianni becomes very jealous after David falls for beauty Sofia Sofia, she gets David in her car and tells her that she is the only guy she likes and wants to be with, but seeing her In love with Sofia, she decided to commit suicide and David to the car with him, not driving on a bridge. David survived the injury, but he remained with a disfigured figure. It is then loaded with the murder of Julie. The thing is, David does not know what is real and what's not as it keeps these strange dreams (Most of them are actually nightmares.) And flashbacks, some of them just do not make sense to him. Everything will soon come back to him even though he started to find the truth. <br /> Well, there is a whole star thrown here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noe Taylor who all have good performance in the movie. In the movie they all put on different things about having characters, such as happiness, sadness, madness, etc. really well. There is also a comedy of the film from the brilliant, Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-done, different, interesting and original movie that will let you talk about it a lot after it's finished. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. The trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might do to be. She was very well executed and had a couple of really big scenes here too. All in all, an enjoyable movie that really should pay attention too. They are sure to make a lot of "Are They Dead, if not Dead" movie recently.
