Made in the same year as "Vetigo," this is an equally sought after film, though in a lighter vein. She's wearing an enchanted New York during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who projects a spell on James Stewart, but gets caught in it instead. Interesting sidelight is that Novak's rivals play by Janice Rule, from Madge's party to "Picnic" on Broadway (part of which Novak would make famous on film).
