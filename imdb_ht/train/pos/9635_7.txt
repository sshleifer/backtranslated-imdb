Romans in the movie, which is also its main theme, is good and nicely presented. However, surrounded by the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Even worse, the psychology of the main character is unusual and incomprehensible, exactly like the end of the movie. Do not hesitate to watch this movie, if it attracts your interest, but does not expect too much of it either.
