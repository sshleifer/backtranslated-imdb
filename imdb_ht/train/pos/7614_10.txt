I obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. I am in Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am also attached to the characters now. For anything bad to happen would have seriously affected my vote to show off. And Michael is on my list now. Kidding ... I'm so happy to have a season 3, because I was too scared to go on disk 6 thinking that it should end. I can not wait to see the rest right now. Thanks to the director / producer / and the Lost Actor ... I like watching TV again. Before losing my surf in each channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment on TV, but I said that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
