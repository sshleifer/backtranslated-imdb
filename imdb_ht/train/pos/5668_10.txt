I stumbled on this series rather than by accident. After half an episode, I was hooked. American Gothic was a black, weird series with Gary Cole as mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck who tries to gain control over his illegitimate son Caleb, playing by Lucas Black. I was impressed with Gary Cole's disaster sheriff and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black was able to stand against Sheriff Buck, one of the most feared characters created for a TV set. I rarely saw a childhood actor with presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky enough to see Lucas of American Gothic, see her in Slingblade. <br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that never explained while in short run.
