Methinks the best screen version of Quo Vadis? never do. Well, yes, the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book, sometimes shedding and circling its suspense among aesthetic subtlety. But the movie is really and very well "unusual", there is an enigmatic and style, which other versions - with R.Taylor and the new one from Poland - definitely lack. It has Roman decadence, the beauty of decline paganism and infant Christianity. At least I believe it has). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov have done excellent work in displaying their characters. Petronius Forrest looks like the biggest success of the cast (let alone Brandauer who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the essence of many of this dead world (IMHO). That's it. That's how it happened, guy ...))) IMHO
