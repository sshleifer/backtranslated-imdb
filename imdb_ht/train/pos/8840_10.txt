Watching before the devil counts as one of the best ever experiences of the movie. I have intrigued me the mixed response of the film - and for me, the extreme opinions expressed the movie touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the overall audience. It is one of the films that stayed with me, and I continue to meditate and think about it. <br /> Surely the DVD would grow some of the themes and the movie-making elements? Including: Sidney Lumet's Comeback Movie, the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works well, the mastery direction, relatively rare focus Hollywood films are given to male characters and largely they end up struggling to become an open book for women, the performance of Marisman Tomei has yet been presented, but, but remember, and, of course, the superb Hoffman and the central monologue of the sum of its part - for me the heart in the movie. <br /> <br /> Phew! Surely a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment watching the expected anticipated DVD - just to find any comment, not behind-the-scenes, no interviews, no expense. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributor - sort it out!
