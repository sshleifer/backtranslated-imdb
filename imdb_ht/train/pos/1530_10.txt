Old man shows ???? I'm 15 and have been watching the show since I was 12, recoding it on my Sky + Sky Daily Box from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really want to have not canceled it, they did not even get an i let's be inappropriate. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I've seen them all, and not one comes to mind that I did not like and enjoy. <br /> It's a BBC's shame to keep swapping between Diagnosing Murder and 'Killing It' Written - Never Watch It And Does Not Intend. Anyways, it's characteristic of the killings diagnostic, so in-depth, and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It really was a sad day when this show was canceled ........
