While reading in the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a high percentage of reviews were either not actually watching any episodes of the show either all the way through or at their own free will. The thing about Kerching! is that it's a child's show, CHILDREN so obviously if you are older it will look like cheese, forcing, and probably stupid. I even found one saying that these were stupid, but I remember as an eight year old asked why Taj had mike icecube ikea on his wall, and also asked if my parents would let me stick some on me (they did not). Yeah, it may be annoying, the act might be better and some of the characters make things really strange and their hair, but as a child shows, I miss it 10/10. Compared to the things in place today, well, allow just say I wish he would re-reveal. DVD release, anyone?
