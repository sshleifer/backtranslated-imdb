Richard Willaims is an animated god. She was harassed by directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very intricate story, but amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' "greedy"). Joe Raposo's Joe Joe's repostative music does not help either. He did the wide screen for the VHS not to show it to his glory, let's hope for a DVD letterboxed a day. Still it's worth to look for some eye-popping anime.
