Alain Resnais's films are puzzling in the way that they are not really modified for continuity, but rather the shot seems to finish right where a memory has been modified. Love's death is at times a sad exotic drama with a really creative magic movie, and either way to handle the audience of a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationships or perhaps create a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos . <br /> <br /> In the beginning is such a sinister sinister movie theater. A woman desperately ran into the house while a man lying dead in his bed - killed him, or what happened? Soon that tension dissolves as a physician arrives and pronounces him dead, but from having a tougher, dramatic stranger begins: the man wakes up, and after the death of the woman and people actually fall in love actually tragic consequences. Meanwhile, friends, who are both priests, look upon them and submit their own debate in the nature of love, faith, and devotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! In this case, Resnais intercuts the scenes and Snow Shots fall into an excited orchestral score, extinct and bleeding from subsequent vaccines that continue the story. Trapped in this epicular elegiac, the movie developed a rhythm not too unlike a season poem, and I got the unusual reverend Dante Divine Comedy from this one, despite the lack of direct reference to the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic film maker but has just completed the cinepoem structure of something that forces a degree of introspection of the viewer, with the possibility of bringing to the surface some odd reshaping. Memory-narrative, Resnais created. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
