While browsing the internet for the first sale price, I ran through these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I bought this short film from my parents 30 years ago and were always delighted with it. I showed it to many of my friends & they all liked it too. I feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film in Shirley before it became popular or well-known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "racy". Big deal! I just want it last longer. It seems that I must be the only person who owns one of these original, for sale at least, so I wonder how much is it worth?
