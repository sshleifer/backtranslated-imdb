Eglimata (= Crime) is a story about everyday crime committed in a crazy storyline to lead to the sheer disaster. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors such as Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension in their heads and talents and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty laugh. Each watcher seemed to recognize the bad side of their own in one of the characters or at least One side of their own they want to be. The actors of every age who played bigger and smaller parties became an equally large space in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal belongings (apart from the first mentioned ones) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but many amazing actors pass through some episodes from time to time. Anyone around the world understands Greek should find a way to watch this series, though it was over 5 years that it was on TV. In Greece to keep repeating the series (ANT1) at every chance there is summer or early afternoon area .We never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew!
