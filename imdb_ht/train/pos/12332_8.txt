When you saw a short time in marathon movie horror, I believe it's a funny parody that slices at the main point of its reference. Though the terms are crispy and stale today viewers, it is not a means of a crumby waste in time. Though a student's film was promoted to an excuse, the evidence is that it appears to be fabricated and cared for a little bit budgetary. As noted by another review, it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the palate with a toast of joy, sit back and idle bread in the movie. /> I think this should be short-cake in a movie should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the reference title and the viewer should relax and roll it.
