I can not believe I just now see this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about the slaves being mistreated, and I avoided roots for the same reason - as I have yet to see the Schindler's list - I do not want to be "entertained" to other people's pain, no matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be. So I guess the main thing I noticed about the Purple was that it was not about the blacks being mistreated by white. Black people could perfectly violate their own daughter - or give them away to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to look, but everyone was rescued by the end, and the act was phenomenal! I could not believe Oprah's character played at the age of 35! And I worshiped Whoopi to start with - it was amazing. I'm so happy I felt lousy yesterday afternoon and Showtime was running the purple.
