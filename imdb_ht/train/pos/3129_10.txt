This is one of the special special reunions ever, and Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it. It's amazing how much effort has come to detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960s, wearing Batcave, Wayne Manor, costumes, and actors who choose to play the smaller versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minute is well worth your time, and it is a pleasure of all fans of the 1960 classic "Batman" TV series. I remember that the clips from "Batman" came from the movie, and not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. Let's hope the three epic shows are coming up on DVD.
