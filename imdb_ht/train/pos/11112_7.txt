Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with the yard, add some Roman mythology and many Lowbrow comedy, and you have the Sopranos, on a crowded mob family from northern New Jersey. It's almost as fun as pro liter. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire Tony Soprano's very complicated James Gandolfini, a psychopath and an occasional glimmer of awareness. I also came to admire the contribution of such as gravel-chewing Dom Chianese as Uncle Junior's uncle, but Tony Trooper's silver-haired Tony Sirico as Paul's permanent embarrassing and beautiful Edie Falco as duplicitous, hard-like-nail Carmela and Soprano. The violence is sudden and graphic, the body counts gradually climbing every season, but it is often the most important moments here. Watch Paulie and nephew Christopher Tony (Michael Imperioli late in LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in Pine Barrens and sit a bitter cold night in a abandoned tune, both convinced they had it.
