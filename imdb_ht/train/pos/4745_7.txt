I can not understand why they decided to release this film to present the American audience to the dynamics of Jet Li. The legendary point would be a better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it certainly is not great either. The final battle sequence is performed by Yuen Woo Ping who went to coordinate the Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and duplication. (I begged Hollywood studios to release these films and subtitles.) Jet shows her charisma charisma in the title role with Francoise Yip having a cool but short role as the Girl 701. <br /> Black Mask Has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gunfire and explosions. More focus on fantastic physical ability It was in order. Black Mask is a decent movie but makes yourself a favor and collects the legendary point if you want to see a tremendous movie that really shows her skill.
