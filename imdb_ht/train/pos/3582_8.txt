Here again another movie from the 80's that most people just do not know exist. This slow, picturesque (shots in the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and remind me of the recent "Open Range" costner, which also starred Robert Duval), and emotionally filmed film is the perfect type of movie to look late one night when you can not sleep or about an afternoon afternoon. Those of the right attitude will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how to come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the older son are hunting. Their performance is full of tooth and slow-paced nuances. Glenn Close, Robert Duval, and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their portraits, as all players are supported by young actors. I especially love how director Cain (who unfortunately has not led anything to scores since this except the first "Weapons of the Young") gives us a little quiet little of everyone's suffering. We do not just see how death effects the younger brother or parents, but also the sister in the middle of the precious, the wounded uncle, his mad wife, and the deceased teenage girl. What we essentially find here is the Mid-West rural response to "ordinary people." There are also shades of David Lynch's "The Right Story" in some of the Downhome down under moral morality as shown here and also in shots love to attach to the farmland to live. This is one of the best and more realistic "water-jerkers" of the era, and a pretty little get for your quality movie hunter out there.
