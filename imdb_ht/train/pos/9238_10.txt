Although others have commented that this video is just a edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you watch the original shows you will find that dialogue from this video editing was modify out. I found this video better version because scene and lines were added to it. I would say if you want to see the show in its original version, watch the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes they've offered on DVD right now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes in the Galactica 1980 than did the actual emissions themselves. In general, I miss this as a 10 because it gives you more enjoyment than what the networks wanted to show in the place time they gave to the producers.
