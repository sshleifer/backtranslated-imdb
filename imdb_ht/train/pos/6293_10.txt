Buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only car I've seen towards the end of the career allowing him to make the physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. It's always a shock to hear her sorry voice in the talkie sequences - her voice is about the only thing I do not care for, as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled. He even repeated some of the gags used in his early de-reelers and Roscoe Arbuckle. I heartily thank Rod Serling to introduce us to this episode, and to give Buster's genius the full scope. He did not have much time (one episode) to do it in, but this is a tribute touched by Hollywood's greatest genius.
