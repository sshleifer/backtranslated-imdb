I saw War Mystery barking a bit of wood in the press and the general public (taking the imdb voting for example), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men are more fun than most films, definitely wittier than most that they are called comedy films and very almost 'smart'. <br /> The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as is Geoffrey Rush and Tom Tann. The Limo Kinnear scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect movie movie star and it imbues her character with the right balance of quality books and realism to make her work. <br /> I'm going to admit the rhythm is a bit off in place, and the visuals are certainly very flash bang, maybe the detriment of further characterization, but at the end of the day, this is the film's high concept - it's about time they are little "What's up Tiger Lily?" - and there are many great people in this film making it worth repeating.
