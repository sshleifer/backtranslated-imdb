Like the characters in this show, I also was a teen during the 70s. The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, for being a suburban teenager in the 70s. The 70s modes, cars, furniture, food, and fads are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show boasts a very talented ensemble, which all meshes are very well on camera. I really like the sequence of unique psychedelic-style films. There is no other show of camera tricks like this. These cutting-edge films, really help convey the hipness of the campy, characterized by the 70s era. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very funny sitcom. The one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-addictive humorous humor, generous laugh. In this way, I think this show tries to be too much like getting married with the kids. While Marrying Children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's pathetic that the creators of the 70s show, are still trying to imitate it. <br /> I recommend that 70s show, mostly due to it's nostalgia factor. It might be an even better show if, if the writers have been counting on witty dialogue, rather than bass, joke and pranks.
