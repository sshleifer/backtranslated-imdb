First of all I would like to say is that Edison Chen is very hot and that Sam Lee is looking better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've seen so far; shows a poverty life in a Cambodian. Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around to kill people to survive; he did it throughout his life. Sam Lee (Wai) duty is to take the Cambodian for good. There are tons of violent actions, but there's a good story for him. The movie shows the struggles between these two characters; They both beat each other like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... INFORMATION ... (GO HK FILM)
