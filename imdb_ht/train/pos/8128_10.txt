The first time I saw it as a kid living in East London. The brands of Hitler Luftwaffe were all too obvious and the landscape of the film was reminiscent of our streets. I remember having nightmares after seeing it. The odd thing is, it really does not have to date if it's viewed as a piece of social history in fiction movies. <br /> Apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of cars has been seriously curbed, plus Nano-Technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-designed work. It was interesting to see how travel travel became known to that time. I would think that shooting a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. However, many were good. Mans desire for war, inhumanity man. This means in war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
