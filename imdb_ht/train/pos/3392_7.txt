This film was a lot of thought induced, especially for 1973. At the moment it was actually a big box office success. After the 1970s it seemed to be forgotten, but its central message was too important to completely disappear. It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time ... no one had ever heard about 'greenhouse effect thermal 'in 1985, and controversial topic of euthanasia was rarely brought up. <br /> <br /> with special effects might look a little outdated, but big money for film movie was a player in that period. If you look carefully you will see everything usually makes sense. This is a message film, not for zonked out star wars fans who cant sit in a minute of thinking excitement unless it has a million dollars worth of explosions. This was also Hestons latest movie good, at the end of her major trilogy scrutiny. And it was all thick disaster and catastrophic waste garbage. This would not be the most fun movie ever to make, and the finish would be crap and depressing, but it's hard to find any movie producer and bowel who would attack a topic like this.
