A beautiful film made at the beginning of the '60s Yugoslavia communist. The five young actors who are young in the center of the story provide strong, sincere and emotional deep performance. A clear clarity of how the natural and trusting natural inherent in genes can be easily manipulated and how it affects the rest of their lives. Very recommended.
