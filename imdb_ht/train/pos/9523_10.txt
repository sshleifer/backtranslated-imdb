I liked this movie! I'm a fan of Tom Hanks fans, and I was always impressed with all of his work. From its most dramatic role as Cast Away, the Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. His hilarious role as a League of their own, Turner and Hooch, catch me if you can, the Lady Shooter, Big & In Story Course game. But in this film Hanks is not just the big actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an up and coming star showing great promises to Hollywood co stars as Hanks son and deliver nothing short of a great performance. It is certainly someone to watch out for his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. It's really a legend. We can not forget the people who did not have the big roles in the movie, but they always helped make it big. Jennifer Jason Leigh's beautiful & very talented, who is performing in Bastard's performance from Carolina & Single White Women I will never forget, brings her favor to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and performs a superb job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in films. He does such a great job with such a role, and loves his role in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I dreamed of Africa giving a great performance.
