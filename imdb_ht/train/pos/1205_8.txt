This film is exactly what title she describes - an attempt to get you purchased by what the writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First, it's fun to see Toronto's 1996-style I remember with all its funny comic, sunglasses, clothes, and attitudes. It really has not changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, small village backyard that makes a great meeting place for international film types! It is also fun to see Kenny and Spenny head in LA and find out that it's Toronto all over again, only with a strange variety of beach bomber, musicians, fortune tellers, and yet more movie films. I do not see pitch as a movie to be enjoyed; It's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys looking at someone's aspiration as being trampled. I take pigs as a warning that power and money are really made by exchanging studio and home production. They should (and "successful") writers, musicians, and actors are always transpended only when they reach the Big Time. So Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
