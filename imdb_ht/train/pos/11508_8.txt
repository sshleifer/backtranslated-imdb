I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went on to scary / suspenseful funny. ABC's fault. They moved the Friday night show at 8:00 pm, then known as "family hymn". Never should have been in the first place Friday. I've been a high school sophomore and love those early episodes! She was first up against women police on NBC. ABC had great problems with Friday night. The bad season is usually until Barney Miller, Baretta, and SWAT are debuted in January '75. Kolchak should be a hit. Darren McGavin was asked to get out of his contract at the end of the show. Too bad the writing was not up to Richard Matheson's original movie cinema. Still, McGavin did his own Kolchak, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS has been established with the manual handlebars and teletip clacking looks picturesque and ancient today, yet what was part of the appeal. They were very likely to have Simon Oakland reprise "Vincenzo" in the television films.
