Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It is a movie that induced thought that makes you think and makes you ask our culture. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I've seen on date. This movie should have been shown in film festivals around the world and I believe it was a serious contender in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly thrown and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunted by their roles. <br /> <br /> The story of the film says about partitioning is a very important story and one that should not be forgotten. > <br /> He has no prejudice or prejudice and has given the partition a human story. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are Indians evil, Pakistani evil and good Indian and Pakistani. The cinematography is excellent and the music is tune-up, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the act just took my breath away. Everything was perfectly thrown.
