I was in Irish origin, liked this film, Not only was the warm guy and comic he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl who fell in love with too, she was beautiful. They were like a beautiful couple. The end was sad. Enjoy this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should look first. Even the story of young teenage guys falls for older women, older women fall for young guys. A lot of cross paths, in the end, are the best decisions they have made or work to complete. There is nothing else to say, without damaging the entire movie, all if I thought the French guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", that movie is so good. Quick quote, you can not get unless you look it "well, that's my dinner loss." LOL
