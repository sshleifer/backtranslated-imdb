Miss Doktor is as a good show as any of how the once film industry in western Europe has declined in the past 40 years. Then in the late 60s, while the great Hollywood Studios were on the ropes, Italy, France and England turned out to film out the void left by the Hollywood decline. There were photos of James Bond (Doctor Name was a surprise hit in the USA, it was first released in the century theater theater in NYC with a 99 price admission afternoon), Clint Eastwood Spaghetti in the west (with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor who never pays Italian producers a cent) and French crime movies usually went to art houses, with exceptions like the Sicilian Clan. And there was European co-production such as Doctor Zhivago and, of course, Miss Doktor. With her great budget for the time, talent and the world involved, Miss Doktor was good enough for viewers to always remember the film decades later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The wall is opposed to shooting a squad, and little chance of spying on the game. This sort of cynical mood plays well across the national borders, in the Vietnam War era in 1969. The steam scenes between Suzy Kendall and Capucine probably did not spoil those performers' chances of getting part of Hollywood movies, Hollywood studios in the process of troubling overseas distribution and production business. Fox was no longer co-produced film like the Sicilian Clan, Columbia would not distribute films like Belmondo to the night call. MGM has gone even further, cutting almost all film production, selling its chain of theater in India for the value of the bottom country and unloading its borehamwood studio as Kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in Las Vegas (where a Bally gift store Bally sells MGM memorabilia in the cost of gifts, the remains of the auction at MGM's proprietary deposits) <br /> <br /> Paramount distributed Miss Doktor, but the Gulf and the West Charles Bludhorn, which took over the company and in the studio's studio's studio committee, charged the studio's public library (as I recall) and really became interested in movies after chief production Robert Evans began to turn out one hit after another. But that was in the 70s. Miss Doctor and her lesbian scene are buried, with offsetting versions of the movie showing up on local stations in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth More was usually tipcast as a bumbling guy when he was older, especially in the BBC's hit detective BBC. When he was younger, as in the British film Titanic, he plays the standard he preferred British officer. At Fraulein Doktor, she had a chance to be a lot tighter than usual, as I remember. It would be nice to see if my memory in this movie is accurate, about its role, and, of course, these horsemen riding wearing gas mask and cover covering up battles. That was a few scenes, and Alberto Lattuada showed that it was some director, helming the World War II Influenza World, where the money spent on production value really showed up on the screen.
