A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This film is for small children, but it is also a great movie for my age. The story is about an ant called Flik. He carried havoc on his colony when he destroyed the foods for their superior cisterns. She gets basked and needs to get bigger bugs to fix the chaos. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is sparkling especially for late 90s. The good story, but a little more detail would be sufficient. The voice acts well with the most animated movies. The music is nice to listen. There is nothing special, but it has a nomination for one of the music categories. In general, this movie hit me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I missed this movie 10/10.
