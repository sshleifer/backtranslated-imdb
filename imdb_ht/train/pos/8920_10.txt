I was not aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew I was very scared about going to see this movie. (I would have been devastated by the movie "Trantula" at age seven ... but I was ten now). The 1st scene where the Pate pulled up the booth's probe and engulfs but he was enough to let me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered in each of our monsters. I felt like horror when Steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office (poor doc), and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience. . . much of the fact that he oooooozzzzzzed from the front door, too big now to fit into just one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in potential growth, and when he blocked poor Steve in an on-the-go diner, it seemed like a dinner to ensure to be. <br /> <br /> To say that the cold pate would be a modern day description, but in the end, better glass than scratch and mental infant toddler. <br /> I remember walking home tonight with my uncle Nick, trying to act brave. She knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed in that night I could not only feel the pate in the room but when I was summoned up the courage to look down the floor, there was red pulsating , the heart of hunger dude is sitting, waiting for me to try and get and go to the toilet. It took months to recover. <br /> I'm 57 years old now. . . I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course the blob was not destroyed.
