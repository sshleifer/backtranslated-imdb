Actress This movie is a very well-acting movie. I'll say that their performance is a bit weak at times; but for the most part, the act is very good. The only actor who blew me away and his performance was Jude Act as Harlen Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle wiped off at a few points throughout the movie but it was also incredible. Paul Newman is still good. This cinema is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely used this word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you paused, you will see the delicate work fabricated by the man. He set up each shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera still has a postcard as good as the screen. When the camera is moving, each shot is planned to discrete perfection. But he does not stand there. Conrads choices in color and contrast between light and black settings are a work of art. The way to read the series is some of the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie has made it what it is. This movie is in the top of the list for Best Movies with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Heroes, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. People's story saying this movie is a year old Gangster gangster but I believe they miss points in the movie. It's a love story about a hit-man who fails to trying to protect his son from the life he chooses. It's a brilliantly fabricated story that unfolds in a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but one another. The Writing Screen is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman is making a sad note but hope to intensify this sad but hopeless story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving notes I've had. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director and an experienced director. The symbols it uses and its performance come from his actors are a rarity of today's film-making world. I'm going to be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
