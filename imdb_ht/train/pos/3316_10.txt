Bette Midler is indescribable to this concert. He gives it all the time it is on stage. If we laugh at its jokes and antics or Dabbing our eyes to the tensions of one of its tremendous bullets, Bette Midler moves its audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. Something interesting to look at how incredible voices it has changed and matured over the years, but never loses its power. The more "vocalally correct" version of "Stay with Me" never loses anything to the spirit of the ROSE or lesbian divine, Here it is just more pure and as sincere as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.
