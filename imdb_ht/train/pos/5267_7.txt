Apparently Ruggero Deodato figured out, earlier, that his story would not work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to put it up. The result is a movie that can be seen as either a comic sword-and-sorcery season or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'm going to go the second way. Shortly after Gore's time, Paul Brothers openly mocked the material (they even barked each other in one scene!), And there is also a good, courageous, good-featured performance by Eva La Rue, as little The girl who tags along with the "boys". Plus, where else can you see the bowels of a dragon lit as a disco ?? (***)
