I like to sort this movie to remind me of my wedding. It's very own you can see it with family. Very nicely done. The songs are OK too. I think the writer's director is great. The movie shows how marriage is scheduled until now. They have couples in different stages of life and relationships in the movie life of very well-pinned quite some steps in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogues are good. The film depicts complex human emotions very nicely by and over dramatization. Also, perfect show is after all not so perfect. Shows very nicely to the dynamics of wedding rows when it is new. This movie is very well written and directed.
