Together with "Brothers and Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of the favorite new dramas in the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Greatly thrown around, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (photog's back) and Hope Davis (recent widow of journalists killed in Iraq). Aside from the act, the writing was fresh and superb to act. The show was also shot in New York City, the real city, by Warner Bros. or the other studio's withdrawal, adding a high layer or realism. I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivors" and other garbage facts. Too bad it did not last.
