I realize that many people hate this movie, but I must admit that it is one of my favorites. I come to love her better when her predecessor and happy love her better than many of the movies. <br /> <br /> The first, I think people never give the story any credit, much like Back in the Future, Travel Time is difficult to write, and in this movie they have included traveling time with a Spiritual Travel. <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were about to have the best performance in this movie, they look cooler, act cooler, and say things cooler. This design set in this film is also awsome, well-detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets are made for a movie about two young buds that can hardly spell ... It is not that the genius of the entire franchise, which makes these two idioms larger than life characters responsible for all of the utopias of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was also awesome. Bill and Ted actually look cool at Bogus Journey, where as in the Excellent Adventure look rather like, well that they would put it, FAGS !!! <br /> The same music in this movie is awsome, especially the score. There are so many I could say about this movie, because I love it. But this is one of those movies I've grown watching and every time I've done I love it more, so I can understand why people hate or just think its Bogus compared to Excellent Adventure (which i even I love the way). <br /> Take down with yourself SELF !!!!
