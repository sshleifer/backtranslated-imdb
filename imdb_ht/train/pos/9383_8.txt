From the director of recent 'cinema' seduce and 'killing me again', comes another movie in the noir style. Jan Dahl creates a niche for himself by making movies on the terms of adultery, blackmail in the early 90s. Even though I did not have much of an opinion in considering the seductive. But nowadays, Mr Dahl has devised directly TV shows. It's a shame since the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is quite an impressive movie that revolves around a cage drifter) that comes to Wyoming for a job. However he does not prove lucky and he gets mistaken for a knock-on man from Texas by JBS Walsh's owner bar. He gave the job to kill his wife (Boyle). But Cage decided to split after taking the payment upfront without doing it. On the road from town he accidentally hit a guy on the road, who he then took back to the local hospital. At this point, math cage meets Walsh again, who also appears to be the sheriff. After that night cage comes out of her clutches, but meets the real hit-man who is happening Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl has co-wrote and directed this film. That's why it's going to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen. The direction is in good standard, however while watching the movie I got a made to feel TV movie. There were too many closed frames. However this does not discourage the movie of being an enjoyable experience. The film had good speed and the structure was perfect. Dall writes the script with lasting duration. <br /> <br /> Cage presents the role as a real chalutist, though my performance has seemed a bit cramped. Her facial expression was about the brand. Lara Flynn Boyle was warm and occupying her part perfectly as femme fatal. His pony was far and could make any guy go on his knees. Hopper played his part well. But I felt it was wrong for this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man. The role has not been written to keep her personality in mind. While looking one will find already the pre-movie cinema before the 'hot spot' and 'A Perfect Murder'. Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar. In general if you're a fan of cinema noir, then this one is for you. Worth Recommended. 7/10
