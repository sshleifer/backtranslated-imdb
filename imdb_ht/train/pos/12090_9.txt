I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parents basement on a Saturday night. It was shown on "Chiller Theater," a regular feature that I watched religion as a teenager. Now I've seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theater, but never stuck with me like "Dancing Macabre," a.k.a "Castle of Blood." I am 51 now, and only last year I was ample enough to find a relatively recent, quality DVD edition of this classic awesome-inducing classic supernatural, having thought I would never manage to see it again . I've already looked it four times more, and may not seem to get tired of it. They just do not film movie like this one yet. Cataclyte haunted and melee-barred grid just does not work as well in color as they did in black and white backs of the day. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, delightful shadow, cobweb-wrap'ed lying haunting castles, restless spirits re-adopting their deaths ... and ending mechanically. <br /> <br /> IMO, this one right standing with Robert Wise's "Haunted," "The Innocents" (and Deborah Kerr), and the most recent "others."
