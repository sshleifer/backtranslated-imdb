I, I'm a kid in heart, meaning I love watching cartoons, always doing! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, she was my favorite. I thought people, this was a great "new" show on TV, and than my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and I love, "Dad, Bugs did not exist when you were younger. " So, I guess it was definitely happy more than one generation, possibly 3. I love to show it's great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, I and my husband, both in our 20s, enjoy watching their shows, and we do not mind re-running either. Show this brings back a lot of memory, the ones happy. I love Christmas special also with Tweety as Tim Ti, it's nice. I can not pick my favorite Toon charms, because they have changed over the years. When I was little it was Bugs of Neck, and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I still love her. Actually, I must say there are all my favorite. I give this show a 10 out of 10, because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, voice acting incredible, the only flaw is that unfortunately it comes to an end, 2 decades ago, but re-run them they are great!
