I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and they've been watching a lot of his movies until now and none of them have stopped making me laugh. Nor did how lost friends and people aligned. <br /> <br /> This movie is essentially a good man pissing the person. However, it has a variety of ethics that prevent it from doing things that might just make it famous. But in the end it ends up, the culture of life. The film is well tone and humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of a lap dance. It's one of those movies where you can just be happy when it's over.
