I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And casting Michael Landon Jr. in Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not be any better. Dale Midkiff has ways to pull in this character. This movie kept me spellbound from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Death of Missie & Baby Baby Willies And The Distribution Of Clarks Visiting was Only God. How did they deal with the death and how Clark helped them to do this was that of a loving dad. Although there are 3 movies before this one [Love Comes With Sense, Love With Love And Lover Of Love], I feel you can see this film and understand it easily. But let and want to see 3 movies before they are due to the story all the characters have behind them. Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> I look forward to many more movies in his hand in the future.
