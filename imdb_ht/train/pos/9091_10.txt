An awesome movie. With everything you might want in a movie. Big fight scenes and many other actions. Stop, and a romantic love story. <br /> kind of a swashbuckler old movie. Totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The correction was fast and you never bored for the second time. The story is like a classic story of the Royal House issue. The actors are beautiful and beautiful. Costumes are spectacular and the cascade work is imaginative. The special effects are amazing too. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous look. It looks like a bet ensures for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as it usually is. He is one of the great actors of our time. Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even making an English accent and remarkable success. <br /> I found that the movie won many awards, and I can see why. <br /> All of this is an amazing independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN + !!!
