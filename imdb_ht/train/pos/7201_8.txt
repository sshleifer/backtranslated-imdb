Very good dramatic comedy about a dramatic author trying to figure out how to keep himself above water after running out of mind. Can not say so much about this movie without giving the story. I can say that little was like it looks like you're watching the picture. Everyone has his own agenda. Nice little surprise to the end - after all the other surprises. Well written and good performance by all.
