Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine through Sterling's example of love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky) a man who mentally handicapped who puts his 12 minute younger, twin brother, Liotta, who plays Eugene, to medical school. It is set in Baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry, the unbreakable bond of twins, child abuse and good always win out on evil. It is fascinating, and full of laughter and tears. If you have not yet seen this movie, please rent it, I promise you will be amazed at how such a wonderful movie can go un-remake.
