This beautiful and rather hustle adaptation of Stephen King's novel features exceptional central performance by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who sadly died a few years ago) with Denise Crosby and some really opium gore.Dorector Mary Lambert has a nice sense things in visual style, and managed to make one of the few versions of the king's work that is not only worth seeing, but really unnerving. Example of Gage Zombie Kids (Miko Hughes-later in "New Nightmare") is also remarkable, as which could easily have been a ridiculous and humorous character made to spooky.As for the people, who think that this one is not scared-to look him alone in the dark (eventually with your squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will creep you out. Some horror movies like this one or the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not look at groups. Recommended for horror fans!
