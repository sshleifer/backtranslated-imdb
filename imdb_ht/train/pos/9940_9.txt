This animated TV series is simply the best way for kids to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology but will never say it is. <br /> I really think this is the best part of this stream of "cartoon education". I remember you can find little book with a plastic body in several parts: skins, skeletons, and of course: organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream you will find: "It was once again 'homme' related to the human story from the 20th century bang. There is:" It's Once The Spy "as well (about the space and its exploration) but this is a much more fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future.
