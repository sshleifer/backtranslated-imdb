I saw the "Shadow Brother" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found I still thought about it two days later. The story of a Prodigy son (Scott Cohen) returns to family custom furniture business after a missionary in prison, and offers all the necessary types of a solid - memorable character; sharp, observable dialogue; sensitive use of the camera by a movie maker visually. <br /> But more than that, it presents something that is very rare in the multiplex these days: the compromise vision of a mature sensitivity. Talented director-screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to be exhausted, but we find his sense (like his protagonist) paid his brother. He knows how real people struggle in this world, and he knows how we want to see - or at least, experience vicariously - success. But Yellin respects his audience too much smoke to cheer up our back end. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph does not lie in commission, or even in the esteem of his family, but in the "work" he could not abandon if he tried. the essential theme of a world (and especially a film industry) that can not rise above the "bottom line". This movie deserves a wide audience.
