I think this show is screamingly funny! It's not for every taste, and I will not breed or cure as they do not get it. I'm sure they're pretty bright people who operate at a different wound. But if you like it, you really love it. Sarah plays a self-infamous defender named "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in Homer predicament (that's "homeric" as in Homer Simpsonian). <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from his short gig on Saturday night live in the early 90's. I love it immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything he did. <br /> <br /> This show is choking-over-you-eat-and-wet-you-funny pants. That's why, I'm still fast before watching it and wearing adult diapers. Look at that!
