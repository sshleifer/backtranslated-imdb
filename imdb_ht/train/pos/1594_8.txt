What I like about you is one of the series you need to see, but not sure you would see, the beginning is cool and it sucks you in the series just for fun, the second part i 2-3 seasons There are more stale, come and go to what you want. What happens with so many series is that they do not end up with something special because the second part of the series still goes down to the drain, this one also a bit made, the third part is one of loot and ruin series The whole thing, usually but not, this finish is perfect for the set, it fits perfectly, actually I was very upset about all these guys in Val's life, actually I wanted to finish with Jeff at the end but Later on it changed, they chose to take Vic in the series after nearly 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and whatever made the series go on top. <br /> <br /> <br /> seeing it many times the series is actually very cool just don does not expect the second part to be that good it is not but the third part does what was needed and made the series of one which was worth the whole thing, I am happy to say that I was happy with the joy of the series and now I'm going to see two guys a girl and a pizza place, when I saw the whole set I'm going back. ..
