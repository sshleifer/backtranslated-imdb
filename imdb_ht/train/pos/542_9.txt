When I first found that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to look. It took me weeks to realize that I had seen the original of this and loved it. So I had even more reason to look. Well, I watched. It was actually better than later for TV cinema. I hate what happened to Brian's character (you can find for yourself) and I did not like most of the characters, Brian's one included. But the movie needs the characters whipped and harassed with jerk as they make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more. In the end, I was cheering for Stanley and ending her happy. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like the horror movie without the blood, I would suggest you watch this.
