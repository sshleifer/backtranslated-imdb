After a mysterious Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' radio adaptation of the world wars for a real Martian invasion, a Martian Martian group shows up on Earth to conquer only plans to go awry as they find themselves really out of them and in fact all alone. This really is quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just checking the memorable quotes) in boots. It will be more likely to appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test in time for me to see it again recently to prove better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made by name-name star, this may just be the funniest invasion ever put in film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Heroes / Sci-Fi hero stereotypes hero has (cool 50s teenagers, fighter pilots, fearless astronauts, brave soldiers and kooky scientists). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Ready to Die! Earth Scum!"
