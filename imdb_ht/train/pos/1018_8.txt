The film was sub-par, but this Pilot TV delivers a great springboard to what has become a Sci-Fi Fan Ideal program. The actors are delivered with special effects (for a TV set) are spectacular. Having a smart interesting script does not hurt either. <br /> Stargate SG1 is now one of my favorite programs.
