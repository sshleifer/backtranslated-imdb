I probably saw this movie first in 1995. Since then I've been back to it many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Rising civilization." Wow! This was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is the way bigger than me, as I know the movie "Tron" has done 7 years before my time. But this movie was a landmark in the early '90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments set music. I love it very much, I think I'll watch it right now. Bye
