I saw this movie back in the 80's and almost forgot it when I noticed it was on TV again and looked at her. I remember he loved this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even better on second look. All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Lock, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as old-year-old boy who feels responsible for the death of the shot of older brothers him), they are superb. The film has a very genuine feel - a understatement, quiet, deeply moving story of a painful family and grief. The dialogue is sparse but said, and the music act is outstanding. Sort of such a simple, rural version of ordinary people psychic, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.
