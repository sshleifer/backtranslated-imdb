Anna Christie (1931) On its own theme, this version of the Anna Christie Garbo, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just tone down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both is American MGM production). Garbo is if anything more commander (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and acting it is much more restrictive. And it looks frankly more at ease, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that he no longer makes his first photo talk, so was adjusted quickly. <br /> <br /> Without comparing always the other movie, this Anna Christie is still playing the same O'Neill with too many words. Its theme of a woman wants to love without losing its independence here, but it comes as weird old fashioned anyway. Some scenes are missing - section Coney Island is shorter and is not as good - but in general it is a direct echo of the movie first. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply reducing what has already been done, which I am supposed to be a frustrated experience. <br /> It's interesting to see both films of succession because they are blocked exactly the same way (not just the sets, but the shots are all the same). There is an occasional scene rising from the earliest movie - some of the storm, understand, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (from the English version) is walking with his friends on a beam on a canals, drink as they can. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next stage shows their faces, we see the German actors taking part. There is no replacement substitute, for sure, but for my German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, play a sweden young woman).
