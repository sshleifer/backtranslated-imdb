I originally scored Sarah with a nice 8 fat, but I pleaded a bit with her humor late and a thin 7 that is what I'm going to explain. <br /> You will either like Sarah's humor, or you will not. If you do not, I doubt anyone can convince you. You folks know who you are and it's perfectly fine, but then you know that too. Move on, the first season gave us fantastic bits about Sarah, her friends and family, and her activities in life. In one episodic episode, she is "pulled over" by Jay Jay officer whom she met for the first time. - "You know why I stand here?" he asked. "Because you got all the C in high school?" he quizzically responded. It seemed to be a genuine question. - That's funny stuff in my book. Sarah can come to you from odd angles. In another episode, his affair with God was notably funny. God being petty and jealous has added beautifully to the joke. It is smart, it is a tight look, but it would show us the truth of the humor and we laugh. <br /> Then came the second season. While still not without some new and inventive comedy, we seem to have slipped a bit of banal pointers and fart jokes, simply. I get some good laugh here and there, but many of it seems like filler while it, with the writers, struggling to foment some original materials. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings I have for the episodes lately, but I'm boning it out for the gems I get (the tortoise) and waiting for him to turn it around. I was a fan of his "Jesus is Magic" routine and he would like to think I understand what he is capable of. Let's go back to that.
