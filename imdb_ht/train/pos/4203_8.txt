This is yet another film and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier film - a cast and some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this movie about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secret from America - and will stop at nothing to succeed. The movie begins with Peters on a train car watching by federal agents. They know it's a link to a long spying chains. Unknown for everyone is the wild card of the equation - a short time picnic (Widmark) is also on the train and he managed to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying. Widmark thinks he's just another suit he had to skip - just later he realized the gravity of what he had stolen. Now it's Widmark on its own - and Komi and the FBI hot on his trail. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are outstanding and the movie is adapted from start to finish. Although he did not find top bills, should be a special mention of Thelma Ritter. This actress supported was perhaps the performance of her life as a feather pigeon. According to her, she gave this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a crush and sad old lady. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and direct go, they are very good - but with a little exception. At first, I liked the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times on the movie you will see a lady's hole hole in the mouth! Now it is difficult. And then inexplicably, they come amazingly close - too close to be credible. Still, with many great drums and such an effective Noir-like movie, this can be neglected. Watch this movie.
