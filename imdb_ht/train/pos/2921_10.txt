One and only was a great movie. I just finished watching her on EncoreW on DirecTV. I'm an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a good portrait of what life is like a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I do not think that the rigors of professional travel has changed all that much. Sad, funny, and all around GREAT !!! **** 10+
