Distortion is a movie that is sort of caught by surprise .. A sort of multi-layer drama that focuses on a man writes a play about his life experience that is happening right at this time. To be shorter, she feels that his wife is cheating on her, so she hired a private eye to snoop on her. His wife has no idea what's happening. Meanwhile, the actors of this game are also having a few kiopedoodles people up their sleeves by jumping around with each other and with us, we will say, the dishonest people in the world of Israel. Everything is finished in a theater and all actors are present and predictable (but not really) happens. The director of the piece really keeps moving things together and dropping into the character's ensemble, and correcting in a way that you pay attention, this is a fun movie actually, one that I did not mind watching and would recommend people to check out.
