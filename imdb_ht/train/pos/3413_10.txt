Just came out and can not believe that this brilliant documentary is. Rarely you walk out of a movie theater in awe and wonder. Recently movies have become so hyped that the thrill to discover something really special and unique rarely happened. Amores Perros did this to me when he first came out and this movie is doing me now. I did not know something about this before going to it and what a surprise. If you hear the concept you can get to feel that this is one of these movies touching on an amazing triumph over and over the top music and trying to have us completely convinced of what a great story it says but then do not let's go. Fortunetly this is not movie. People tell the story! That's a good job of capturing each moment of their participation as you enter the world and feel each second with them. There is much more than the crap that makes everything go to much more tense. The empty touch was also a great mountain climbing doc and showing the intensity in a way to engage but this movie is more of a human story. I just saw it today but I'll go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
