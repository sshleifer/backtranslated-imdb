When an Australian myself this was a hit right in my face. Fortunately I do not live anywhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it shows everything that the rest of Austria hates about people vyennese (or people close to this region). And it's pretty easy to read that this is exactly the intended director: let you shed your head in your hand and say "Oh my God, how can it be possible!". No, not with me, (in my opinion) totally exaggerated singer swinger club scene is not needed, I watch pornography, sure, but in context I was rather disgusting than putting in a straightforward context. This movie tells a story about how to mislead people suffering from inadequate education or bad company trying to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl treated like a whore by a super-jealous companion (and always holding back), a female professor who discovered masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel lover on the line, an old couple There is an almost daily math cycle (it is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who just divorced and has the former husband suffered from the acts of his ex-wife obviously have a relationship with his masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks his driver the most unusual questions and stretches nerves are not just being super-annoying. After seeing it you feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, sad, depressed or feeling like doing anything ... Maybe that's why I gave it 7 points, it made me react in a way I never reacted before. If this good or bad is up to you!
