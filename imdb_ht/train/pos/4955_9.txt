I do not know why people always want the deeper meaning of movies or others to consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> What about just being entertained? Something in Morgan Freeman excels. It gets a chance to show a bit. Pegas Vega, his co-star, has become a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name for pulling people in watching his movie. <br /> I thought it was a good movie. There are some humor, some pathos, some bittersweetness but nothing about the head. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as the receptionist of a construction company. When she looks at Freeman adorably and says, "You made me want to be a woman." It's just hilarious. The scene fighting between Mrs. Vega her husband and her girlfriend is wonderful too. In short, it's a nice, good movie that will make you smile. You can do much, worse.
