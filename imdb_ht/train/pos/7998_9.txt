I liked this movie. I'm a Mexican and was at the least offended by her. In fact, I think this movie should show police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system as rotten as a 3-month old corpse. It's up to me to read the news how killer, kidnappers and other chimers go free not to pay a sad or live queen inside the prison cells. We should have someone like Kreasy, Denzel Washington's character. A corpse turns vigilant vengeful. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually want real life kidnapers to suffer the same fate as the one crisis has done their job well on. That would be so nice (Sorry, I'm a pimp!). MAN on Fire is a gripping movie that you can not miss. It might be difficult on some of you, if you have not used it to read subtitles (Mexicans do this all the time while watching US movies), but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the correction is a bit soft ... such as TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant take on how Mexico's corruption is). The movie starts out a bit slow, but the pace picks up fruition in the second half. I swear you will be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington throw the bad debts. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The finish (no lousy, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll love it anyway. MAN on Fire is one of the best film year. A "must be clean" for a DVD collection! 9 * from 10
