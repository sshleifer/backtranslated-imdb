This is a superb film, suitable for all but very small, though the least accessible personality was (at least in the print that I saw) not used in some unfortunate choice of subtopic English! For many of the film it is almost impossible to guess at what time-period it's wearing - no modern technology to show, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bike, just a drab, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is dazzling contrast display of the Sezuan Opera and celebration of fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure for a theater of war, this could always be any of the past 150 years. But then we briefly saw a motor vehicle - 30 late 40s, early 40s - and we realize that we are watching a chicken chicken in great perturbation, and that much of the world we see is about to be swept away by the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist Revolution. <br /> The desire of the central character to comply with old customs and traditions is all the more striking. But the film also raises vital issues even today, both in China and in other parts of the world: the inequality between men and women, men and women; trade, for various purposes, of the young children; corruption in society; enjistis; importance of friendship. <br /> Maybe I read too much of this movie; but I do not think so! I also think it's a scandal that this caliber movie is often not shown in the United Kingdom, too, heating is passed as quality material. <br /> But do not get me started on that.
