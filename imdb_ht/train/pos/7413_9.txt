Shower keeps in mind in many ways. Almost all the films take place in an old storm, with gifted donors, patoj, and emotional gifts. Love and friendship between the proprietor and her late child is deep and moving. The older brother's draw in this small world seems unforced and persuasive. The draw is flowing, full of surprises and irony, and touching in general by a sense of what I would have to call neighbors in their relationships with the performers' controversy. This is a movie I pull out when I want to believe in the world again.
