I know I should love this movie, and I do for the most part, but as the other has mentioned, it's a little bit of the tooth. I also found the raging hormones throughout the male crew to be somewhat annoying. It's a wonder they did not start panting and screaming in the months as well. I also said that in general, the movie left me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that penetrates the film. On the plus side effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, accessories, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it was / is. The second half of the movie picks up steam once we begin to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "Krell." As many times as I saw this film, Krell always let me scratch myself as exactly who or what they were. Based on what has been produced at that time, besides "This Earth Island," Planet Banned is miles above the Sci-Fi Sci-Fi movie in the allotted time. Being filmed in color also adds to its fun. Certainly a classic of its own rights, imperfections and all, and deserve it.
