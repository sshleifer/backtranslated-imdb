This is the best movie I've ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett & Richard Miller -two humanity who wants to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, one shot - one kill !! You must kill, if you're skeptical about something, you must survive! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I'm grateful to my worst / worst / english !!!
