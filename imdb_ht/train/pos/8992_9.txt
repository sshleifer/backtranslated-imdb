A really cool cops. A must for any music snob. You do not really need to know about the bands enjoying the movie. Before the movie I heard only two songs from the Dandy Warhols. The only thing that is needed is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The movie centers around the Brian Jonestown massacre. The Dandy Wars have a role in the film, as 'the band rival,' but are second in the BJM. The Dandy Wars do not play as great in the role of the movie as I originally guessed, but then again, they did not have elements of excitement and the unpredictability of the BJM. You can not help but be captured by groups and his very charismatic man, Anton Newcombe. Alone, it's a movie perspective and study on the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
