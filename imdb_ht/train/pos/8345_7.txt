I recently saw I.Q. And even though I'm not a kind of romantic comedy in gall, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many movies in my opinion lack the honesty. You know that feeling when you are watching a movie and you just feel stolen because it's taking something in the story and was like the director just thrown it together as it was trashing? The story between scientists is a sweet and funny one. How to stick together and tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart. I love the love story between Tim and Meg because it's simple and brings a good score when it comes to love, "nothing is what it looks like." I would recommend that for a Sunday morning. <br /> 7/10
