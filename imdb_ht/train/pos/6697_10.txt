I remember first watching Sabrina when he came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I now 24 and still love it now as much as I did when I first looked at her. I get a little stick of some of my friends to watch a "kids show" but I do not care! Lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my favorite personal character and later on Morgan also became another of my favorite characters. I remember spending much time watching various special events honoring Sabrina on the Nickeleoden UK television station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she's great at Clarrissa Explaining All but so much better at this. I was boned when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in line! lol x
