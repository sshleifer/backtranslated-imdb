David Beckham is a British football star and the husband of Victoria Beckham ("Spice Chic" of the Spice Girls). Its trademark is a target shot that strikes across the pitch and in the net. The football equivalent of an unbeatable ball of baseball. "Bend it like Beckham" means to perform the spectacular injection. Apart from that, with a little chapel in the main character's room with a faux-camel to the very end, the film has nothing to do with him. The film is full of little football in jockey, as the present one of the characters' parents gives it to a Jersey with the number 9 on it (the big property Mia Hamm, to the person in the know) Referring to "Bech Posh 'n'," the hommage video for one WUSA is the character to play for a friend who does not believe ("they * have * that"), lesbian gags, sports-arm gags, and so on. about a young girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. She has a real gift, but the two indisputable obstacles that she must overcome are the absence of a professional female league in the UK (hence the passions with our WUSA), and its parents, who are American immigrants in old-fashioned ways that does not allow daughters, among other things, engage in contact with sports. The girl's family is described as the face of ironic fun, but with great affection - my great Greek myths think. The girl loves and respects enough to go to hell sitcom to hide her growing soccer star in hand.
