The title of this movie is taken in a party game called "Seven Minutes in the Sky." The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, NY, and described it as something like the "Spin-Bottle," "Lifesaver Relay," and other games kissing preteen. According to the rules, the boy's name and the girl should be designated, and the chosen people were ordered to enter a black closet together with the stay for seven minutes. In the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests as to whether the two had the nerve to hold hands, embrace, and / or kiss each other in the confidentiality of the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say, "The time up" or hit on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. After inviting other guests, the couple should admit what they did during the "seven minutes in the sky." Then other couples should choose to enter the closet until all the guests were involved. The couple who admitted to make the most should be the winners of the game. These games served as social "ice-breakers" for children and adolescents, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating people who are shy. The film was given this title because it deals with first-generation youth experiences and romantic love.
