This has to be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine breathtaking and stunning cinema acting with an interesting plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog bites dog made me hold the corner of my chair during some scenes, recited by horrors while others, and let me drown in my own water after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves a deep impression on me. It's violent scene shocking controversially with the striking and tender scenes of 'love'. The film is undeserving in it's Cat III (stripping) rating; no naked scenes, and 'love' scenes are not even involved kissing or 'making out'. The message that this movie presented to me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel may seem, have a sensitive side. Edison Chen makes a superb job playing part of the murder Pang. <br /> I missed this movie 10/10. It's a must-watch.
