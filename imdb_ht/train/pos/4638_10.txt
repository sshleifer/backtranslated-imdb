I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. My Hebrew does not speak, so the subtitles were very helpful, I do not feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! She painted two of the most important taboos in the Middle East today: A homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows someone to enter both times of conflict together. The dilemma, the emotions required. The climate film in tragedy when anger and rage leads one of the lovers in one extremist side! an absolute must see !!
