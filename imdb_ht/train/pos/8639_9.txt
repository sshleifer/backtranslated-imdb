I started off by exquisite because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. It's mostly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> The act does not all involved was quite good but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a giant Pitt fan but this happened to be one of his best roles ever. <br /> Brutal, honest, Gritty. All words to describe this movie. <br /> I read a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind the Early War does not explain. He explains but they hesitate not to go through graphic details to get points across. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this a 9 because every 1 or 2 scene bar was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Mele.
