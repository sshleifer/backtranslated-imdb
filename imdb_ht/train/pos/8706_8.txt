What happens when the average joiner finds it supernatural? The situation may sound familiar. The mechanisms? Unbreakable? However, the movie Russian Sci-Fi action, the sword Bearder, is far from the standard standard. The story revolves around a man named Sasha who like a boy was shunned out of society, his classmates and family due to a supernatural power that he owns. When it wants or anger it allows, a prolonged sword comes out of his wrist pens to his own skin. Very wolverinish? Maybe ... but that's not the exciting part of this movie. Shunned his whole life and driven by anger (and a temper he has) our "hero" returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason. The only thing he's meeting here is the problem when a newcomers meet with the old boyfriend and let him bleed on the ground. This is where the revenge and anger come to play. This is a man you do not want to cross and from this point to the mafia and the police are on his tail. She meets a girl and falls in love immediately like her and this is really what the movie is about. The film is very impressive with dark colors and nozzle spliced ​​and short yet extreme action sequences. This art house is at its core, beautifully filmed with such attention in detail in every stage of action female-girl sims. It's this odd walking that is very interested in this film. The director's approach to this genre is refreshing to focus on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a movie action right. Do not worry though, the action is there and lots of it. However, many of these sequences show only implicit violence and pictures of terrible consequences. This does not mean that actions are not shown. These scenes are here and they are fantastic (especially the ending where we see the full power Sasha triggered in hopelessness). The principal selects the violence of many scenes to keep focused on the emotional character's hand in hand. This is a tragic love story with a refreshing entree in the genre.
