Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad Knightly insists as good looking like Jeremy Northam. Strong Mark did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas father. I love the end scene (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the crop is in with Knightly dinners and its workers and high society friends. Emma must show her accept this now. It's a woman changing. That's too quick but OK. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays former Emma's governor and confidant. It is wonderful. as I would imagine it. I believe that when the UK a Jane Austen is the best. American worms in English literature make money and not for quality. See this one!
