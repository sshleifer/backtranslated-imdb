The film was of great value to family and love. He expressed human emotions and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand to make it perfect for kids) and was enjoyable and funny at times. There were a few charging symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinemas were doing today (which quietly frankly getting a little warned out). It was clearly filmed, but had a good quality of it. Although correction could do better I thought it was a beautiful movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown to you that was something I did not like either but at all it was a good movie.
