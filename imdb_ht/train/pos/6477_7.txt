'Five days' is billed as a special, a crime drama that includes a series of episodes, each put in a particular day in a police investigation. But in fact, this element of the story turns out to be rather less important than the first could be thought, as the fact that the action of every episode is imprisoned in 24 hours is hardly noticeable, and very small distinguish the program from many other crime stories. In fact an almost can not help designing the latest comparison of the 'first suspect', as one of the sub-cemeteries focuses on one, cynical knee approaching approaching retirement: and not just the absence of Helen Mirren making comparisons is favorable. There are a lot of reliable submotic, manipulative music and a set of seemingly converted characters so that each one in some sympathetic sense, in another suspicion. And it is possible to guess the party guilty well before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things to be true, justifying the way that the focus range about certain characters at certain times. In spite of these weaknesses, the series grew up to me: in the end, I was well gripped. But it's a sad sign that the BBC, which once made the love of 'song Detective', this program of "possibly the best drama of the year": for the little original genre on offer here , and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is suddenly disappointing. 'Five days' is in fact not waste; but it is formulaic, and one would expect that the very best the BBC has to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh.
