"The Tenant" is without a doubt one of the most important horror films ever made.Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky, a clerk records clerk living in Paris, who answered an advertisement an apartment, only to find that the tenant before attempted suicide by tapping from the apartment window.Trelkovsky is obliged to visit him at the hospital and has it to satisfy Stella (Isabelle Adjani) .Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the tenant before dies and , first, is happy and has found such a beautiful apartment. Its early soon replaced by paranoia waves as it becomes increasingly suspect of his neighbors, which seem to try to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat suicide tenants before. This film is great.Polanski managed to create a surreal atmosphere of fear and paranoia.Plenty of brilliant moments like the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers teeth before the tenant in a hole in the wall, or the fever dream where it wanders in the building The bathroom has found the walls covered with hieroglyphics. The photograph by Sven Nykvist is really nice. "The tenant" is a negligible gem.It can be hard to track down, but it is more than worth the effort.
