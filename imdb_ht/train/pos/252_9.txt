Performance was superb, the costumes gave a unique feeling for the period and being a Victorian living Victorian, I was impressed with the accuracy of weapons and attention to detail. <br /> I would not say you need any knowledge of Kelly's legend to stay with the flow of this movie, but to understand what's happening and attitude in the time you'll require a bit of basic historical knowledge. Not expecting, as some rather funny people do, any of the characters has accented to Auzzie as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during childhood. <br /> <br /> OK, the story was some element of fiction, but these are required for a larger one than the movie. Gregor Jordan said of the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that's exactly what happened to me for this movie gets thumbs up here. you will not regret
