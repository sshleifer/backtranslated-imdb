The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and James Stewart (except for some days of work on night passage before separating company with the star under less than friendly circumstances), the country far turned its mainstream look to offer another portrait of a man emitted Steer does not want to give redemption, fight it every step of the way. This time, he is an animal driver who has the answer to working problems - nasty trouble in a campaign at the end of the trail - the result of his creatures being confiscated by John McIntire's heavy cop at the Roy Bean School of Law and order. The thieves are back and take them across the Canadian border, it soon finds itself unwillingly drawn to the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as it cheats or kills them out of their claim ... great surprise that way Stewart gets to the end , it is a surprisingly cruel criticism on the road, even using his desire to just stand alone excuses by warning of a group of prospectors in a future avalanche when he has the chance because he does not matter. For most of the film there is really only a wide hair between him, and McIntire, something the judge recognizes instantly, reveling in the company in a family spirit that just as he had lynch lynch plan. In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in it probably recognize it - despite the appeal of dead-and-burying it's best nature, there's an unspoken recognition that the sole person who can stand up to the judge is an almost human bad as it is. As usual with Mann has an exceptional use of high-rise land, though for once the final confrontation takes place on ground level, and the film is almost perfectly cast and strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Women (though Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest vouchers for the annoying). Unfortunately, big movies from Canadian Rockies make some favors by transferring DVD transfer to average, and only the theater trailer as an extra.
