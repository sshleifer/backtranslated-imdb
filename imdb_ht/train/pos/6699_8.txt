When the first Sabrina came to our screen I was about 12, and that's why my teenage years watching the young witch get into all kinds of strange predictions. It was still one of my beloved programs, the feeling of witchy in the rhythmic system mostly 'recorded' but this time the character was cooler. I still love Sabrina because she was smart. It was also friendly and easy to go that made it enjoyable to watch. The characters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, The Quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (My personal fave, shame he left early) Hilda and his aunt Zelda started in OK, but then became irritating. <br /> I love Mr. Kraft as it was always that little closer to discovering Sabrina's secrets. What I liked about the first three series was the original idea, discovered in the family secrecy and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable. Too many characters have come and left, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then decided to make Sabrina in college losing everything for me. Sabrina became self absorbed in college, had less magic, no spell books, no living wives with Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. The last series was boring, and I only looked at what was happening in the end. No Hilda and Zelda seemed somehow wrong and Miles went just like that. The last episode made me feel a lot better though (SPOILER) whose Sabrina ends with Harvey on her wedding day at Aaron's dullard was great! Overall a great program if you forget the poorest of the two or three series that reminds me of many young children. Magic.
