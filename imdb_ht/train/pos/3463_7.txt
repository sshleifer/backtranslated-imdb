I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my youngest favorite is John. I already knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the separation, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band. I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul many years after the separation. <br /> I was not disappointed in this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that two musicians used were very accurate. These include how Yoko Ono would still be there and John wherever he went, the Wings songs "Funny Love Song" were the number one hit this year with the concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music in album "Let It Be." The actors have done a great job in playing John and Paul. The accents could be used perhaps a bit more work, but they seemed to act a lot like I read the old Beatles used to act like. I also loved the dialogue between them, which was basically what the movie was all about. <br /> <br /> The finish of my first shame, but the more you think about it the more you'll appreciate, especially since this was how it really went to real life. They also show the fantastic sketch of "Live Night Live" in which the Beatles will offer $ 3,000 to make on the show. (as compared to $ 220 million others were offered) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more of a feeling why the Beatles were broken up and why they never got back together.
