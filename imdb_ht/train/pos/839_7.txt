Think Pierce Brosnan and you think suave, dapper, intelligent James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against qualities - and it is very fun to do that (like the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who befriends a harried businessman ... and it works! <br /> This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a fixed, on-the-edge Brosnan and a good, compliant "cut" -Key Kinnear has some good lines). My only Cavil is that Hope Davis, playing Oh-so-tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more often: it could be a great monsoon of these guys. /> This movie is like a matador: she plays with the audience, while "going for a kill". The finish is awesome because a scenario (with a positive moral!) Is: this is a frenetic, frantic and fun movie, which deserves a wide audience.
