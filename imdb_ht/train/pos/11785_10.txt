I do not quite know how to explain "Darkend Room," because it summarizes it would not really do it justice. It's a short Lynchian manicure movie with two beautiful girls in a mysterious strange situation. I would say that this shortness is definitely more about the Lynchian Spectrum Spectrum "Mulholland Drive", as opposed to the "Elephant Man" or "The Right Story." It hides on Lynch's website, and well worth the search.
