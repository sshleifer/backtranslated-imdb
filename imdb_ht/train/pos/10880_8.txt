A fun somewhere. An enjoyable, well-constructed place. No need to say "Do not take it seriously" or "so badly good" or "it did not fear." None of the important comments. <br /> <br /> Cut off atmosphere. It's that atmosphere that is actually very unique, with one really original aspect of the movie, which personally is what makes the movie, for me.
