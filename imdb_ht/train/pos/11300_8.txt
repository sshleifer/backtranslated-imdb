Ossession <br /> <br /> The first film Luchino Visconti, this Italian Noir is generally credited with launching the neo-liberal movement - well, saying so right on the back of the box - and it is sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of people with sense of moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, a variety of supported characters - including a clever eagle that captures beautiful types of communism - incorporates the desperate despair of a country looking for its identity from blood, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express the weary terms already well developed, the Spider web is misleading - although a sting of noir is a protagonist positive manipulated by fate and females, Gino here So unhinged to begin with that you fear it might be worth it - the cosmic too much trial, the relationship illustrates the tension and bathing. All the same, it's incisive and essential, although its current impact on movie history is certainly debatable.
