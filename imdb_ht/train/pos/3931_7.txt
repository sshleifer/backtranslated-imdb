A somewhat fictional biographical portfolio of Abraham Lincoln's early years from Director John Ford focuses primarily on a trial that the lawyer advocates two brothers accused of murder. The movie offers an interesting portrayal of this important American figure and the movie is well done but looks a bit incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debate. and Stephen Douglas. The obvious intent showed Lincoln as a young man developing the attributes that would make him the big man he would become. But the result for me was that while I admired the painter it just was not as satisfying as I thought he could with a larger dimension. <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively display a quiet force. The Fundamental Performance Foundation includes some gangly 's performances and other appropriations that are fairly effective in presenting a painting in Lincoln, particularly when combined with some effective and costuming makeup that occasionally are a bit sustained. It's solid and surprising does not include that much of Ford's regular cast (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of the most prolific characters in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in more of AFI Top 100 films than any other actor, both the original and revised list. He also appeared in the 11 Best Cameras. The film presents a scene that would seem to inspire a similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", where it should be even better than it is here, though this scene is one of the most effective this movie.
