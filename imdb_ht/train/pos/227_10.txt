Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Robert E. Lee's Confederation, based on IMDb.com's database. After seeing this movie, you can think Duvall's appearance is the best reincarnation. One of my favorite films. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or had a band available. Beautiful scenery and music and "all-true-to-life," especially for those of you who live in, or have moved to the South. This is a "real time of time." Life moves slowly, but "foreigners do not live."
