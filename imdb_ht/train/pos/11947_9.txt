Simply well written, directed and acting ... Woody's best in the year 2000 is not the best it's since the 80's !! Hugh Jackman chose to opt for her roll. Scarlett Johansson scandal with Woody proves how to balance an actress he has come up. <br /> It's refreshing was not in a romance on screen with the leading lady. She plays the perfect bumbling magician. There was a review of some malignant films. Do not let them stop you from seeing the beautiful movie done. The people in the crowd I saw this and they laughed loudly in some lines I missed the next line. If you like the Woody Allen movie in the 70's, you'll regret missing this one. <br /> I suggest you go to watch this movie with an open mind, if you do, you might walk out smile.
