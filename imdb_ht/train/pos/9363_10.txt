This movie was amazing, it is the kind of movie where you look it and rather than looking at other movies by the actor you look at other movies by director / writer. Sandler has done a great job working out a character outside of his comfort zone, and Cheadle's always good made a great job too. This film is great for a mature smart audience. The act was fantastic and can only be more than written and directed by the movie. This film focuses on the real Americans, the last generation, no stereotypes or racism just those who have come together and realize the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and survival. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it defines it, not as a person who heals you magically, but rather in the need to speak from your feelings to someone who is impartial you can not trust you will be judging, but rather will guide you even if your thoughts. This movie is full of amazing rounds!
