"Bruce Almighty" looks like extremely stupid, especially in the trailers. But I found in a deeper message that actually made me like this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and given his divine power to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man painted here as God, and though it is not his usual style of film or one of his best roles, he is excellent and what he gives them to work with. Although bullies at times, the film has quite a few laughter, from Bruce split her soup into half like the Red Sea and her customers reaction, as well as seemingly laid-back and wisecracking the image of Freeman. It is overly exaggerated at times, and some luxurious humor, but in general it manages to be a bit funny. There is a decent support throw, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, who always help. The movie film proves to be very romantic and break-jerking, with the clear message, that we should do what God called us to do and "be the miracle." The movie is far perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than me and many people probably might expect, especially if we see the deeper message in the movie. <br /> <br /> *** from ** **
