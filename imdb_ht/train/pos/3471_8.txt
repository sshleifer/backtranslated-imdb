Recently exhibited on the TV cable opens with a warning that distinguishes itself from any co-operation in real life; which in itself is an eye catcher. But the script and acting out of the main characters are superb and I find myself scared at all. The lesson has no small way of thinking, thinking, and exciting dialogue. The film is about a one-day meeting between between real-life "legendary" music that formerly composed together is seperated.Fim in capturing the essence of life and philosophy, in a story that proffers an explanation for the first "split". What is so impressive is that the actors give these portraits seemingly realistic of the characters to play, blame and all, that this viewer at least left believe I witnessed a true event in almost every detail. The great skill in playing this is that and writings and fines acting a movie basically on "Two of us" talk can make an excellent picture. Not least at least 8 out of 10.
