Simple, meaningful and deliver an emotional punch. I regularly trail in short film threads and still nice to come across something with a simple and strengthening message, without pretention or self indulgent. A boy in school has to go through a lesson when his friend plays unusually and provides the most important lesson in his life, it is only found that when there is no copy enough to go through it was shared and intimidated by the school. Unlike the shortest films featuring children or The actors of these children keep their own and are credible. The soundtrack nicely comprehends the emotions of the piece and the punchline of the movie works well.
