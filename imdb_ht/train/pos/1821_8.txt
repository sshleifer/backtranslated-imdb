When I was a girl (and my dad owned a video store), this was among my favorite movies. I have not heard so much about it since then, nor did I really remember anything about it, he forgot the wake of the other Don Bluth, probably the best film. I managed to follow her down a few weeks ago, however, and she was pleasantly surprised again. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable. There are a few goofs of continuity if you look hard enough, but they generally do not detract from the storyline, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a bit misty-eyed, if you're a lover of animals). Characters are credible (maybe even a little too grown-up for younger observers), as well. Two claws arise, and for those of you who have not seen it in a while, definitely worth a re-look.
