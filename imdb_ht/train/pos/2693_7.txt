Even if the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" finish is nothing but a bad joke about the audience, you can see what attracts the good actors of the project - it offers them the kind of role in which good actors can shine, and shine forth. The film prevents iron - for its time. It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend one of letters, and directions to Hopkins' direction and more clearly references to points The original plot could only be hinted at. The end, however, always blows. (** 1/2)
