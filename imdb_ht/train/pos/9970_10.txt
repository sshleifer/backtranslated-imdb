Brilliant use of technololiv's exaggerated illustrated extreme are optimistic at present Christmas ceremony. The actors of the performers during the scenes (Santa & Pedro resumes behavior of peering society in a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although it was subtle, stole this term in his film "Pierrot le-fou"). Highly recommended!
