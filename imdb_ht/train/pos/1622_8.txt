I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of most Dark Black Animators ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (by Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats "Waller, Bill" Bojangles "Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (despite) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are from the famed" Club Cotton "in Harlem. True ... The stereotypes have, but this was the way it was ... and these designs were meant as adult entertainment in your local cinema before the main feature. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising Cartoons tend to be more "cutesy" and more upscale, (after all ... we are talking about mgm) than the short animated standard made in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox , RKO or Low Columbia. Even Disney's early Mickey Mouse had loads of barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him just before he went to "Technicolor". <br /> <br /> Disney has some cartoon and caricatures of black animators as well ... for example, 1937 at Symphony Funny "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years of now ... clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will be examined, analyzed ... and even tolerated by future viewers.
