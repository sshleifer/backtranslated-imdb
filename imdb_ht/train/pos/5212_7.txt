STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> A fairly good actor, getting not on it (now fading) looks rather Any dramatic dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, still a sure bet in the role of the leading people who still holds a remarkable presence today. But nowadays, it seems they've established more of these sort of direct DVDs / limiting their role liberation and as such may seem to be more stuck in his fortune now. <br /> It has been drawn to some stringent issues here as cunning social worker Earl Babbage, a worker assigned to a few hundred sexual offenders in an area in the U.S., with his new coverage Allison Allthrop ( Claire Danes) must take in his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive herself for a case she fails over that age. This is a certain dip in the most advanced side of humanity, treading on materials definitely not for the tray or looking for light look. And as such are a very strong, compelling film, unflinching and not constrained by it in direct to DVD budget. The only thing that really pulls it back is cheats to use frequently, fast off camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a little bit quick after. But it's still some of the solidest material I've seen Gere's, relentlessly darker and more on the edge as it goes on. ***
