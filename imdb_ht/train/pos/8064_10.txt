John Ford is one of the most influential and best-remember American filmmakers in the history of films, whose names are usually associated with the genre of Western films. However, John Ford's earlier film is not a western at all but a drama set in the Irish battle for independence in the early 1920s: 1935 at the Informer. <br /> <br /> The Times are tough on much of Ireland and burning out Gypo Nolan to take off an internet in poverty and despair - and the walls are closed in. Gypo is great but it is not the shiny bulb on the tree, There is a warm heart but a short fuse, and never seems to really think things all the way from it is not a criminal or an independent pig. Walking the streets starving with no place to live, hulking Gipo Nolan finds the first lady in her life, Katie Madden, on the streets asking herself because of her own desperate situation and starting to dream about taking her to the United States if he only had 20 pounds to pay for it. As luck would have it, Frankie's friend returned to town with a 20 pound price on his head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police at Frankie's location. Gypsum, with the new 20 pounds without money being earned, finds this nicest feel of the foggy as guilty of all over it, and the IRA invests all the resources to find Frankie's informers. Victor McLaglen shows Gypo's fall to Nolan and definitely deserved the Oscar best Actor she gave for this movie. Its brutish, stupid, and tender turn to give the character dimension and McLaglen is the only second of Arthur Arthur Bach's Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Arthur Bach. Margot Grahame's performance as Katie Madden is excellent but he and McLaglen are the only members of the cast that are really impressed. Preston Foster is mostly miscasted as an IRA head, mostly because it is most obviously not Irish, and JM Kerrigan's disappointing borders in all its roles in the movie, but throwing this irritating support is the movie's only point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> them. Beginning of what would be a long career in Oscar nomination and winning for John Ford, the Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in 1936. Ford and the company's use of shadow and light in the movie is particularly engaging and vital to tell stories. Gypo's market in the streets is being told by the gloomy state of the city and the blatant allegations of the street lamps, each shadow constantly reminds him of his dark deed. Ford's command of this technique was amazing to look; If the informant did 10 years later (so do the genre requirements) it would probably be considered one of the best movie noir ever, but that does not prevent it from being remembered as an excellent classic film.
