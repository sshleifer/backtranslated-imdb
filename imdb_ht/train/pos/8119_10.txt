I think that opening this 20-minute film is perhaps one of the most exciting films, with the brilliant music note working to build tension at a higher score. What went to cinema in the 30s, I can only imagine. The 'Times' said at the time, 'there's a miracle coming to the screen.' Watch it with wonder.
