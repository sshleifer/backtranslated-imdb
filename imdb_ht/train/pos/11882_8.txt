This movie was temporary in my collection, but it was not before a friend I reminded me about it ?? until I decide that I should watch it. I did not know much about the lock of Leo ?? just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of the movie and dealing with a very serious topic ?? Help <br /> <br /> Although people have help? they are Leo ?? The scenario ends in the way in which Marcel (the younger brother of Leo) couples with the illness of his family. At first everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel ?? it is believed to be too small to understand the illness of his brother ?? The fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributing to the unwillingness of parents to discuss the problem with Marcel's youth. I know from experience that on many occasions older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when a person is young this does not automatically mean that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in the most appropriate manner then, even themselves. With the exception of the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left quite an impression for me ?? to support their son ?? even after discovering the truth about her sexuality and his illness. The fact that allowed Marcel's youth to travel with Leo in Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend was quite a gesture in their hands ?? Most families I know will be reluctant to do that. There are a lot of heat in the scenes at which the brothers spend some time together? you can see that they were real friends, anxieties about each other. <br /> <br /> Close to Leo is an excellent drama, which I recommend
