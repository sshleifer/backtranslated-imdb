People were too hard on the movie. Sometimes we should just sit and enjoy the story without trying to "review" it. <br /> <br /> All things come together when Hackman decided not to pull the trigger but its target still down. Then the fun begins as everyone on it also "down" .Just think JFK and everyone is associated in any way with his assassination, who in life ended abruptly and in doubtful ways and you will appreciate what is implied in this movie. <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what can be done well. Even though the EXACT line does not follow (retrospect here after reading Jim Maars "Fireworks") but it's what's implicit that's of interest. <br /> I would like to get a copy of it again. In light of what's known today, the Principle Domino is right on.
