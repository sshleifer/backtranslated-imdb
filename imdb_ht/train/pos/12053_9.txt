Well-done ghost story that will give you the ramps and some nice crises just off the road. The story is slowly dissolving, building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget it once you've seen it. There are no gorts, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-constructed tale that is best seen at night and lights out.
