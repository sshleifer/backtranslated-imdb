Joan Fontaine star as the villain of this Victorian era movie. It is compelling to play the married woman with a guy on the side and also setting her sights on a rich man, Miles Rushworth played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite as Miles. Miss Fontaine acted on her part in perfection - she was at the same time cleverly, figuratively, innocent looking, frightening and good. It takes an extravagant actress and talented cut. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by Travis Banton. Also in the movie is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
