This is a very gloomy, hard hit, even brutal movie on a death row break that goes awry. It's black and white photography keep it from being dating. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted, yet unusual sympathetic lead. One of the first movies shows the psychological disillusionment of death row. It is also quite intensive.
