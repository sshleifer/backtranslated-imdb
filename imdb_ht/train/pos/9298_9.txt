Simply, one of the funiest movies I've ever seen. It's a parody of crime-life, parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930 .- There is no need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5. It's an opinion of a mass, and mass hypnotized. Who decided to watch it - it will be sorry, who decided not to look it - will regret more.
