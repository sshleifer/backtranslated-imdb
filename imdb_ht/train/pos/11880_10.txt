"Scarface" has a much larger cult now, 22 years after its release. It has also been widely criticized as being very tackling, bullies, on top and all stuffed up! These are those that compare the Scarface films to godfather. It is true that on the technical front, (movies, scenario, directions, etc.) Scarface is the way behind the 'Godfather'. But it is also true, what Scarface has with some gangster other missing movies, is the sharpness, the approach to starving the hungry gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look more menacing and real than any of Italian poles or the Irish gangsters from classic other gangsters like 'godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the biggest points in Scarface and I strongly believe this made was written in as "tackiness" by most critics! I saw the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original on the "renewal"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud of this movie. But how about considering that precisely the movie movie maker wanted Tony Montana's character to be! It's this mad young man who makes quick decisions and throws to adapt to rage every other minute! It is not the Michael Corleone calm here. It's Tony Montana, a very tacky, insulting person who does not really think so much and it gets mad all the time! <br /> There is definitely a very 80s feel this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's' terms, 'Push it to the limit' and the instrumental title track. There are some memorable and beautifully shot rescue, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother. <br /> <br /> On their performance: Al Pacino is brilliant as Mad Cuban refugee. It was reported to have enjoyed Tony Montana's most popular career in his entire career. And it really looks like she enjoyed herself well at all of her scene! One of the wonderful things that "Scarface" would be like without Pacino. I just could not imagine anyone else featuring Tony Montana and in all probability, the movie would not be effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's Manny friends <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So is Murray Abraham (like Omar) in a small role. Then some eye candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. It looks nice and adequate in her role. <br /> <br /> The principal goes a bit further during a particle part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little party suffering from bad touch. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most fun and one of the best gangster movies ever to come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw paint in the Drugs and Gangland Chefs!
