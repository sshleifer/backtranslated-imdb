An absolute classic! The direction is impeccable, the act is just superb. The words fall short of this great work. The most definitive film about Mumbai Police. This film was tested twice. Om Omni gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil is no less. All the actors are doing their best and the movie races on your typing at every moment. This film will tremble all that you have and force you to reflect on the many issues that confront our society. This story is a cop (Om Puri) that starts out in his career as an honest man but ultimately degenerated into a killer. The first attempt at Bollywood to get behind scenes and exposure to the depressing truths on Mumbai cops. Kudos Nihalani !! <br /> And these films have killed someone in Bollywood movies that has exposed the nexus police-politician-police. So, this movie was really a trend trial. This trend dominates the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a mock box office hit. <br /> A must-see for smart movie fans.
