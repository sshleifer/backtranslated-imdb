It is difficult for me to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does. It just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. But yes, the plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill HAD dies and Richard then he can make him a little crazy than he was already, that would have added more to the suspense. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband get out of Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a bit more back story. I was a little disappointed and finished in the movie. I would like to see Zack's closing and death closing and possibly close to her husband. I must say though, I will never be able to look at a rocket gun and not her picture standing there. It was a very tight end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I am so looking forward to his future project.
