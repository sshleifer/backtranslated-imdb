In a lot of his films (Citizens Kane, Confidential Report, The Touch Touch) Orson Welles has given him the role of a tireless boy. In "Lady from Shanghai" it's the only time I see him holding the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I guess it's because she's in love with her. Therefore, it's an interesting movie. But I find the story too excellent. Direction is engineering, as usual and Welles: The two scenes are particularly brilliant: one of the aquarium with one of the finest and mirrors. This movie is brilliant (10/10)
