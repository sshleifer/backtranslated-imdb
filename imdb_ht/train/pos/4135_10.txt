This is a absolutely good movie, one of my favorite comedy comedy. It's very funny and the cast is wonderful. Though Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with Shakespearean works she shows in this film that she is no restricted way to play only classic theater. He managed the transition from the divorced cyclist, who is trying to avoid women and the way insane, to the loveick puppy that fell to Lady X play by Merle Oberon Efor. The dialogue is beautifully witty and refreshing and the breathtaking atmosphere. Ralph Richardson was a fun to look at. I highly recommend it.
