TRICK OR SCREEN is a beautiful example of Hollywood jumping on the "backward metal music" movement that Tipper Gore and his wife Washington kick-started in the mid-80 mid (other, less successful entry of this mini-genre included terrible the black and funny GATE ROSES). I was a high school sophomore when TRICK or drawn out and could not wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from the video store at the end of the 80's, but I finally picked up a budget-priced dvd copy shortly ago and brought back a lot of pretty metal memory from back to the day. Any teenager teenager can relate to Eddie's "Ragman" trials (Marc Price of "Family ties") in this film as she is persecuted by preppie "beautiful" people in her high school for her heavy metal and flavors music. Eddie's favorite stone friends are Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Tommy Lee at Motley Crue), who died in an early hotel fire in the movie. Eddie is unknowable until she gets a weighing test at Sammi's latest album, unreleased from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons to kiss in a short chat). Eddie soon discovered that this LP, when playing back, allowed him to communicate with the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon Sammi will give Eddie advice on how to get the same with his preppie torturers but when the messages increase in scariness ("Waste'em all ... no false fox!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, which results in Sammi comes back to life via Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi rampage at high dance at Eddie's high school and takes the scene of the crowd rock and disengage one unlucky "fake metallic" before Eddie arrives to save the day with the girl in her dreams. (SIGH) No, he is not frightened in 2006, he did not even fear in 1986, but TRICK OR DRAW is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metals and has a court-court courtesy courtesy at Fastway Culture. Well worth looking if you've ever bang yourself or have a taste for B-grade movies sinister (or both, like me).
