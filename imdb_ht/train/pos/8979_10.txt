I liked this movie, in the first rough graphics seemed odd with the pine tree but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of foot shot and I really admired the job to cut it off. If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the movie for you, but there are some great characters here, (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked it too much, to have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or perhaps it was just that the foot looked so dark anyway but I was not annoyed by the usual objects seen in video transfer video. (Water opens my black drive, especially because there's a cheap, progressive camera available now and I do not see the excuse of not being good for one if you're trying to screen the movie). Sorry this is my own little Rant. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious, I might be accused of laughing at others, but it's a classic piece.
