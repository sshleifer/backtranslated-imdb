I LEFT, in my opinion, is a great biopic on one of the world's most talented authors and painters. Their performance broke, the band was huge, and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he said most of the time. In addition, when he was dropping an assault, I got a little scared. Also, it's just sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a dead-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or love biopic, I highly recommend this great biopic on one of the world's most talented authors and painters. You are in for a real treat and a good time, so do not miss this one.
