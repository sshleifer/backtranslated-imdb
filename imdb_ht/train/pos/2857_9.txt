As part of our late 1950s vocabulary, we knew well Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. on showing great "Bonanza." <br /> It came Saturday night and everyone was stuck in the TV series. This was a real show showing family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together. Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words show wisdom. We often let them be surprised that Ben Cartwright, a widow, was to be the best of the poor and poor widows of those who died. She brought wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all wonder why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts repaid loads of money when he was gone. His career never took the same as he was associated as a cartwright. It should have tried to get back to the series. It certainly loses a bonanza by dropping out.
