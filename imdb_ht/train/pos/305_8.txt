Screwball comedy on romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his photographs - he reveres them - again Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) wearing a notch above others because, after all, it's Princess Bogdanovich probably fell in love with in the films 30 years before. She launches her in pre-ups love, gets right in the sheets between her and a nice butcher-soft / soft-boiled Ben Gazzara, and allows her room to sparkle at all. Their love-made connections in the movie are fast and fun, though I did the John Ritter's TV rubberiness tires. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and the terrain-sensual Patti Hansen are all interesting to watch. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine and she absolutely gets red. *** from ****
