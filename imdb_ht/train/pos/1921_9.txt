ABC has done more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast in this show. At first, the show looked and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss has shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast. Lesson hours after John's death in real life struck home. I lost my dad in 17 years old and can sympathize with the pain and agony. ABC should be proud to keep this show and even preserve this as the final John wants. This show has matured and developed because of these circumstances impossible. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
