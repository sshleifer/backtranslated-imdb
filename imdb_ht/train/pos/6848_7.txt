A very funny movie, this begins with a soft porn sequence, the initiative of farcelike comedy in the art gallery, adding a shocking to a breakthrough in the hotel room then introducing a random murder for any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is scarce and surreal (the particular interruption scene is exclusive unnecessary), resulting in a "twist" ending revelator which is as obvious as it is unfair to the viewer (see the Trivia section for precisely why it's deliberately unfair). <br /> The movie goes out of its way to be offensive to many groups as possible - transsexuals, the oven, and the wonderful "Huggie Bear" style stereotype radio on the train - and condescendingly treats the viewer as a fool In the scenes are closed, as characters endlessly explain each other in great detail and over and over again what's just happened in the movie. Even if the female characters experienced in the restaurant scene at the end is a joy to look. <br /> In fact, the entire movie is a joy to watch: Despite its many, many flaws, the whole package just, well, works.
