Misfits in a military school? Hmmmm, funny sound, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters, the Arab thief, the crazy teen teen, the smart lips, the skin smoker, and do not forget the guy who burns things. Throw in a strict sense of serene, homosexual sex and a sexy ammunition teacher and make one movie movie crazy adventure. <br /> I saw this movie and it's funny, because the comedy is turning around the fact that if you try to work together, things do. <br /> <br /> These group of misfit students at the Weinberg Military School were put in here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes "because you are savings, embarrassment to your family and community, shame." One of the earliest Ralph Macchio's performance before the Karate Kid and Vinny Cousin, with the emergence from Barbara Bach as well, this film appeals to youth and adolescent youth. <br /> <br /> Great band that keeps the movie moving.
