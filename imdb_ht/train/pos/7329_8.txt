I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was a little absent at times but I loved how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is only the second movie where I saw Verone acting (the other was 'sacco bello'), and I can see why Italians find it tiring, but he thinks he's playing his role as the dad likes. <br /> A disadvantage to me and this film was that I knew it took place in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I suppose, but I felt like there was no representation in a place. This film could be made in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important that movies have a place to give viewers something to relate. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movie, then I think you'll enjoy this. It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a funny story and serious moments that might really happen to any of us.
