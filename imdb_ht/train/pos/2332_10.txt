"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch" As soon as I first heard that, my attention was close to the trailer, After the First Episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern Fairy Tale that brings my spirits up and keeps my attention to the whole show. I think the Acting and Distribution is just perfect, Each character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the villains once managed to overflow with a unique sense, out of the guy Guy Bee who can swallow kittens, never seem to let me down. And the deaths that would normally lead to a depression often end up being purely funny (like a exploding spell & striking book) Even with the huge amount of Crime shows we have now one day is one of the few who really Standing from the rest, Being not just a mystery, but a love story, Comedy and a Fairy Tale with a hint of Dram all cooked in one wonderful Piece ..... comic show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was about ABC, For years I never had a reason to go to ABC, but this has brought me back every week and a smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But just like that, after two seasons, A few rewards, A Big Base and positive response from the critical show has fallen. It looks as if Ned has touched ABC again and forever killing it for me. I'll always be a fan of this show though, and I recommend this to anyone who likes a lot to talk to a lot of love from the watch shows.
