Many liked this mystery movie 1945 mystery about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who was out of work and was falling behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an announcement from London's local newspaper looking for a secretary and runs out to try and get this position. Julia finds the position and is hired by a Ms. Hughes, (Dame Me Witty) who asks that she lives with her employer in her home and she does not have any involvement with male friends and Julia tells them she has no family and she free to devote all time to this work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Ms. Hughes and has some very strange desires to play around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were locked ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and landscape cost. This strange family lives in a huge castle off Cornwall Coast in England and has secretive and very suspense doors.
