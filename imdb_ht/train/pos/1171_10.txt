I found this episode to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. South Park creators have made the best parody of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They've really touched on Romero's hidden social commentary that he did with each one of his films. I would like to know what George Romero's opinion was about this episode I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping her true vision for her zombie epic completely intact! Most spoofs deal with Gore at most without making the viewer think as Romero tries to do with his movie. I think if a zombie epidemic has happened we can actually worry about the value of our property before our lives as shown in this episode!
