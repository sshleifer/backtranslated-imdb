This is a movie that I can watch over and over and never tired of it, it's plenty of laugh, gun, action, crime, good a lyric, and a decent draw, with a head, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedy role as an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks hot as he ever did and can act as well, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character "Max" a DEA agent Diane is FBI's agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV , play the bad guy, "Livingston". Draws these centers around Max and Diane trying to take Livingston while fighting and discussing each other on who is getting the money for the respective agencies, dropping into the Sutherland Assassain mix, which pretty much has all the Good Materials, This is perfect crime crime, there is the usual love story, but played very different than you would think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian Mafia, Italian Mafia, and Chineese Mafia here cast in the mix, is the shotgun film in Boston, where you have some great shots, and locals, great photography and music in this movie , this film is just the epitome of a crime comedy, it has everything that one might ever want. Check Sutherland's toilet in a particular, very unusual scene. This movie is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 more for me.
