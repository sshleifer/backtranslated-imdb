While being a gay impression when the first Gundam wing series, on the re-watching the series, I was recommending my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the draw, the gundam design, character design , and the depths of the mastery characters are executed. While at first appear as a boy band of sorts, the most stylish character of the characters can in part be credited just to great art, and individual personality creates distinct and distinctive distinctions among the characters. Consequently, it is very easy to draw on any particular character. Personally, I loved Heero because of his stoic personality. While I can participate with a sentimental attachment to this show in my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we find peace?) While offering charging action Fighting in great robot suits, which, to say at least, is excellent.
