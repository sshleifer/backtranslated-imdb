It is still a nice surprise when a movie made for TV turns out to be fun like Little Richard. This is a very watchful movie about the history of Rock and Roll, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon who I have never seen before, but is a very good job. As most movie films, this is a little upset than if it's made for Cinema which is a shame because I'm sure there are so many we could see on Little Richard's controversial. Instead we see a very religious garbage that is the only thing that spoils the movie and eventually spoils a very promising career. All of this movie is good and the act is higher than the average television movie. 7 out of 10.
