I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story got underway, unfolded in a very beautiful movie and rhythm movie. I was surprised and pleased with this (basically) true story. Did I want to read more about this fascinating character, which means, the director fulfilled his goal, and the movie was a success!
