.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally vanished me !!!! Whatever happened to the old Burton that he "Knight Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as research for his preparation led Batman back to 1988-89? Not appearing in it Burton did not research the book, nor the film cause he got everything WRONG! This movie sucks! It's not as good as the original and it does not cope with the same subject as the original. If you want a good movie look the original look. <br /> ** from star ****
