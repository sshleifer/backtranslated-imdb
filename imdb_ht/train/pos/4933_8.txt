Refreshing 'lost' gem! Present effective dialogue combined with excellent acting skills and involve enough to care for what is happening. Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palaces are his usual bad presence. Widmark has staged the scene scenes, a car chased less than 60 seconds with a 'logic' end, and a long running running run that shakes the sequel behind the Hollywood contemporary. You know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained at all. At the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you'll ever see. The movie seems to slow down a little past, but staying with it for the rewarding conclusion.
