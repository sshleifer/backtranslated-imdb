While not as wild and way out as some of Takashi Miike's later films this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Complete the following is that his little brother will act as the lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications that both hold interesting and distracting things from the central national violence. This complications and loss of way over an hour in the movie that makes this less than a big movie. (It's a very good one one) This is definitely worth seeing especially if you do not mind there is no frantic pace. /> <br /> A word of warning, the violence when it comes to explosives and embarrassing. There are also repeated semi-graphics of gay sex. If that's not the cup you were, continue with caution. <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
