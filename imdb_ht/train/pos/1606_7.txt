"The movie is aimed at adults" is very rare these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and it is always a better than average movie, which is aging very well. Although it's funny at times lower than the rest of it, the film has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that do not use the characters or viewers to swap them. (This Mobsters never appeared in accomplishment. It never gets grotesque like my Greek Greek wedding) The high story lines are economically said and short scenes that allow a break from the big wire. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where immediate values ​​can not be impressed on producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It was also very well involved in older characters. The film takes its own little, quiet path to a conclusion. There is a wrong writing scene that includes any place to do some sphincter executives relax. Cage and Cher do very nice work. Moonstruck invokes old-school, ethnic, New York workadays much like 'Marty' except Moonstruck is way less testimony.
