I had just recently read the novel "Mom's Night", I owned the DVD for some time now, and watch it every so often. My few movies I owned and saw made me think of as much as Night Mothers have, I am surprised at the shine not only in Vonnegut, but in the translation of her texts on screen. <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on DVD, and it must be accompanied by the next director of the movie. To see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and did it work well, I think any viewer will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The Omis in the movie are some from the text, and it does not detect from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and it is the best adaptation I've ever see. I so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it makes a bad merely say go look at her. <br /> It will change you if you do.
