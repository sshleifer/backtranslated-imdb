This movie is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a series killers being somehow turned into a snowman in some B-film chemical accidents. He then heads for the city and begins to terrorize the locals. He went up to the local police chief and some other characters tried and stopped him. he did on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the big thing about this movie is he knows his litter. The impromptu styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killers snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budgets as its main selling point. along with the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listening right from the beginning to the voice of a spotted father to his children in death, and the rape drunk scene ever engaged in film. fantastic tacky fun
