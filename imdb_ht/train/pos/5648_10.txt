Recently I bought a complete American Gothic series on DVD and she lived up to my memory on it. I was very grateful to be able to see for the first time those episodes that have never been televised. I liked the "Ring of Fire" in particular in the stories I did not see the first time around. Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also superb to paint her. In fact, all the cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. <br /> It's a shame the series was aimed at the network (in complicity with a group developed in dignity) because it was really designed to look adult. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, mascara, satirical, gothic romance and horror styles, offers brilliant characteristic that is supported by acting at the engineering level. <br /> I had the most tremendous lament for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most luscious "fallen angel" ever.
