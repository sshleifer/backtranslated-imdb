This is the best movie ever ever made. It deserves more then what it got in the Oscars. Nominations for such things as the notes, art directions, support role (Newman), this film could easily be nominated for Best Photos, Directors (Mendes), Actors (Hanks), Supporting Actors (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks provided one of his best performances, and the kid who played Michel Jr was so good that I'm surprised I do not see him in more movies today. Critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. But besides the incredible performances, another real star in this movie is the incredible music. This is by far the best note of the year. He was nominated but did not win. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. My Class A +
