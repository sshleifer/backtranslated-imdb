"Bend It Like Beckham" is a movie that has been exhibiting very little here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the film was strongly British in dialogue with terminology and did so much with football, (football here), which some might have problems related also to the U.S. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserve much more protection over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (after a dream), is something that many people can relate to and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good movie-feeling with an inspirational and truly good source act. I was not excited about seeing this movie initially but now I'm sorry to see it sooner. I highly recommend this movie!
