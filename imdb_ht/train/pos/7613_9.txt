/ The first episode I saw in Objects made me think, I thought that some people were crashed and get chased by a giant monster. But it's not like that, it's beyond that, because they have no monster at all and all the episodes that you see in losing, well it's getting better every time. a desert island and an underground bunker and especially the connections between those who crossed each other before crashing. That's the real secret. <br /> <br /> Rule this series and I can not wait to know what's really going on there I hope they are not the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
