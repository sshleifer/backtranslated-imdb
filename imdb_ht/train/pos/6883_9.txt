On rare occasions a movie comes together with the power to expand the idea, warm the heart and touch the soul a lot. "LOOK" is like a movie. I got "LOOK" from my wife who got it from a neighboring film business. She watched her for a second time with me. We were both enthralled. It's as if it's the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOOK" is a magic piece designed to send you back to the moment in which all of your plays started to take place. It does this while relentlessly entertaining. Bret Carr acts as a director by letting you look away from the screen. It crafts a disarmed character with a bunny bunny like, stuttering innocent, but warmly brought with such sincerity underplayed that you forget to watch a movie. When the epiphany struck while the brightest, I saw my wife and tears for the second time. As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaching and anyone seeking personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant, creative masterpiece and power to change lives!
