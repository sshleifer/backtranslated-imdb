Normally the best way to harass me in a movie is to set some references to Orson Welles. But here is a comedy sci-fi quoting the war in the world broadcasts ... and it is gold! The very concept of a small bunch of diminutive, aggressive and stupid aliens made mistakes as children in Halloween clothes are pretty much. Do not be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a child's film is reinforced - it's not, there are a lot of hidden treasures ... A gem!
