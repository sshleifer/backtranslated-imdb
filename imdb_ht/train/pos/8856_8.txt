BEFORE DEVIL knows that you are dead promising to begin, setting up a simple heist who goes awry, said in varying perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At around the hour mark, Sidney Lumet transforms this movie into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; It eventually morphs into a family-multi-family family drama, exploring the full range of human emotions / relationships, as the story comes at its highest chilling point. As is the case with Lumet, he manages coax exceptional performance from his star-cast cast, without any two-acting or hyperbole notion. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and exciting character, and often letter Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; In fact it is quite adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her body adds to this). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) are more intriguing, and in my opinion, it deserves a bit more screen-time. Amy Ryan also does his job accordingly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Many of its features and brands are displayed here, not least of which involves the use of his character. Infected with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and rhythm, and a decent note, before DEVIL knows that dying is a must-see. A gem is really underground. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). They should just go into My Top 250 at 248. Very Recommended.
