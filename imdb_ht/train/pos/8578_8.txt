This film is one of the best American B-movies in the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, a lot of laughter, and a language of variation of a blow on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. Everyone knows the landscape a bit, but that's really what the movie is all about, and everyone is quite funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to make another movie together.
