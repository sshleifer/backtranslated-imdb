A French movie Esther Williams would like. But the synchronized swim was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris ecclesiastical find themselves. There is no question where Sciamma's sympathy lies as all the boys show as "pets" but actually only 3 girls in focus, and forever, and adults and some other teenagers were mostly in the background. Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and force herself on Floriane (a renowned quality beauty for every criticism) and she is also a friend of Anna's convenience: not unattractive, but for her, the time of perfection of her body was short , and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. What indicates is a journey of self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness on the three which is un-natural: where is the scrub and teens chatter in teens? While the denouement of breathing, Floriane's self-absorption is very well described, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, married to the Sciamma.
