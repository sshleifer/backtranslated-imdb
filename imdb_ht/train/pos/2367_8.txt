I could not take my eyes from this movie when she showed up on cable. The dialogue and costume are a kind of more easily associated with soft-core pornography. In this case, the fastest scheme serves as a vehicle not for sex, but for serial embryos and nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.) No one in the genre I could not put Jeff Wincott, and there was no stake in search of. Only once Brigitte Nielsen was trading in her futuristic-nursing pig (so mayor!) To fade high we remember at Beverly Hills Cop II I made positive identities on her. Doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or shake the top-and-wink of Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "what's bad-it-good"?
