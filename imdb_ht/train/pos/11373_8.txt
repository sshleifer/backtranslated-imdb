Here's a oddity: a modern-day movie about a serial killer that has no battle scene, nobody sees dead, no car chases and no loud noise ..... and it takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes but are horrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is detective work, and how many red tape poor detective went on to solve the murders. This is a very sweet film, and "Somber" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), as well. But the story is not depressing and it's very interesting all the way through. Rea is exceptional as determined, stretch-to-look detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is outright scared as the killer. The Russian Occupation Donald Sutherland suspects but plays the only character in this movie with some heat. Again, the story is loaded with liberal agendas, here and there, and not one, but two references to gays, the validity of total ecological psychology, the police and government officials were boorish / rude / bigoted, yadda , yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an intelligent and refreshing crime-crime movie. This is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known, but is well-liked by the people who saw it. Since it's based on a true-life life of this assassin, it's all the more refrigeration. Do not pass it by just because you have nothing about it.
