The original film DeMille was made in 1938 and Frederic Mars. A very good movie really. Hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring Yul Brynner. It's of course was brilliant as it almost always seemed to be at all in his movies. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke engineer. However, the film tended to get a little bit of time. It does not move to the pace of the 1938 version. Still, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
