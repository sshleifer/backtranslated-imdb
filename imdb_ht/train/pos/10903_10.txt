This man has nothing short of amazing. You really feel as though you lived his life with him in all the tragic events, and wept with his family at the end. He was so passionate about his cause, not only for himself, but ensuring others who will survive him do not have to go through this pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "down" day, and it still manages to see me big and brilliant in life, just as Jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. I'm just sorry about Jonny earlier, as I visited England 2 times during her life, she might say I would meet him. It is comforting to know Jonny sitting on his cloud, free pain! Rest in Peace, Dear Jonny. You deserve it!
