This movie is great. <br /> Now, I tend to love my movie heavy on the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like Moonwalker comes along, and it looks, despite many flaws. /> <br /> This movie is no more than a very entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement. Starting with ill videos put in the 'Man of the Mirror' a montage of his achievements list, and bits and Bob from his career, he goes through all the oases of his life, then crashes down into a really segment fun acting as a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Demon Speed', following the adventures of MJ as he runs out of motion-stop movement, and finally dances against a rabbit costume. The stop movement is not as bad as some would have you believe. It's barbecue. <br /> Then we see the big video for 'Leave me alone', and straight to the main feature. <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very tired. We see Michael walking out of a building, then shot in by thousands of troops. Then we hit rbits, showing MJ and three children stumbled upon an underground lane. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the nefari villain who has a plan to get all kids in the world tuned to 'drugs' (no specifics mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the girl she is and get caught, then chase ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then something vessel robot, and of course, the 'Smooth Criminal' sequence. <br /> It's a movie so-so, but it's fantastic for anyone who loves MJ. It has most of its greatest hits, with some cool little bits, and some quite good special effects (the Robot / Spatial particular sequence) worth it, especially seen as if you can pick it up on a quid ebay. It will keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours, as well as most 20 somethings of children when it was first released.
