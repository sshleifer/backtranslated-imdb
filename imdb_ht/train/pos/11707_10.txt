I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then even if it did not have any special effects, the act was really good. And it still has the same message for today, though the technology changes, maybe it should be a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also loved the music in the movie as well, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter during this time period, although now most Christian music is now worshiping and praise music. I was always curious to know what ever happened to Patty after the series ended? Was he going to do more movies, he eventually found to marry and raise a family? I would like to have an update.
