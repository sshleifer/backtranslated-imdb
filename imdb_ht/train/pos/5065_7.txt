All in all a good and better movie for the fact that the movie has not made the story might remain hidden in the masses. Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a past hiding and photography is stunning. For some, this can be too fantasy, giving others boring - for me it is a gentle story, well said and perfect for family watch. Now that's not something you get a lot of lately.
