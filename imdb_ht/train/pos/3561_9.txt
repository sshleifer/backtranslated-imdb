At least one good thing came from Damon Runyon's attempt to synthesize the Mafia. "Guys and Dolls," music that was indispensable to music, was captured on the film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful, enjoyable film playing all stars including Vivian Blaine ( from the original Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character brings an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn's "Roman Holiday") and all of the great leaders, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom have recently won Oscars for Best Actor ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actors ("On The Waterfront") and were on top of the games. One listening to Brando's song "Luck Make A Lady Tonight" talks about where Dylan's early got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings down the house and "Sit on Rocking the Boat." Sheldon Leonard's ubiquitous adds another page to his naughty gallery of screen gangsters. The film has a bright, contemplative, pop articulate design in the early 1960s. The characters speak of a stylized patois, apparently based on the idioms. Although social films and sex roles are dating, it's all great fun, and even the gentle kidding of the Army Salvation is hazardous and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion. Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is just enough to watch this movie, but it has many other attractions offered for its 149 minutes.
