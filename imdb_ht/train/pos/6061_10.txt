I loved this movie so much that I watched it twice and that's something to say about a documentary. The score of music, cinematography and sounds is absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Though he was shot for those great Imax theater, he looks like wonderful sound on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demonstrate your system. <br /> <br /> The subject is also for fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and Michael his son. I was already a fan of Mario because it is the best racecar drive in history since it is the only person to win the CART Championship, F1 Tournament, The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two pretty cars important to the father and son. The first car was found in a chicken coop and turned out to be the first Mario roadster ever driven and we followed brilliant restoration perfection. The other machine is Michael's new racecar and we follow it to cut the mold into the race season. Imax claims just the magic right to make funny and fascinating cars. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was Michael Amoretti's team owner at the time of this movie, tells the movie. Its anecdote and wittismism, drawn from many years as a homeowner and driver, confer much of the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scene. Turn the volume here! There is something about to ride along at more than 200 mph and the music score that totally draws you to the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The ultimate magic element is mankind in the Andretti family. This god, the world of racing, Mario Andretti, is a loving father proudly watching over his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see it. You can say that they are a close relative. I wish we all could have this experience.
