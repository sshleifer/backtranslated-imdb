Personally, I think that the film has made many professionals, I loved the choreography and acting. The plot is also inviting and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional, and what I liked about it most is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has absolutely lived his role in the end, and I must say that it's one of my favorite photos and Saura is a wonderful director.
