Typically, the "kids" films have some annoying types of it that make it way too smash and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, this before holes hit the scene. Sure, she has the very same moments that often give her a child quality aforementioned movie, but this movie does a great job to stay away from these conventions. The act was decent, and the dynamics comfortably that Stanley had some of the other comrades were more realistic than most movies wanted to show. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or to cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than ever to imagine, such as Shawshank redemption in many ways (which also had a similar, redeeming end to it). Just go down the side? Hokey are lizard. In general, however, an 8/10.
