The movie held my interest, especially because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some of the posts on the grounds that the plot was not complicated. I had no problem following it (maybe some people had a lot of eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and earn as well. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a good new talent (nice too), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with her part as well. The relationship of the mother and daughter could have been somewhat unrealistic, but the behavior of young people in the movie was not. It was tragic but Enlightening. He ensures that the other shows on the TV New Years Day are over
