He is a great American martial arts film. The fighting scenes were very impressive for American films made in the 90's. Of course the scenes fought are not as good as Honk Kong movies, actually only a few American cinemas have been controlling the scenes that are as good as Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. When you look at American martial films, you are waiting to see the scenes of less impressive, but there are still some nice movements that can be surprisingly good at times, or at least that's what I expect from those movies. I was impressed by this movie. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, acting, the direction and the plot was good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie, if you love American martial movies in the 90's.
