It's rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting to the short dose of all the movie (eg Big Grey Greek Wedding; Me, Myself & Irene). There was only a couple of unnecessary jamming jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably disgusting. All around, it was a nice movie with interesting characters. I thought the end was a bit abrupt. It feels like it should end it in the global series for a real bang up finish. The act left a little to be desired, but it was made up by the pace of the story. If I would know it was a movie my brother Farrelly I supposed it was to be a piece of turn into rubbish and did not look at it, but it seems that they can accidentally make an okay movie. Good for them, I hope they pull themselves out the rest of the road and start to always make good movie.
