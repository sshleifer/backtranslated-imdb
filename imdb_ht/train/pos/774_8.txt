I think it's a nice movie; I think it's a very romanian movie in scenery and atmoshpere; I think it was not designed to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a goal); I think it's very natural; I think it is human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never make me think ... waw host acting (by Sean Connory & co) nor is film in a buster block, they are like the movie ... normal ppl that can act ... ; I think the film reaches its intentions; I think it made me feel things (or feel again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> I really enjoyed it ... that I know.
