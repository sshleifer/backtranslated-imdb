This movie is hilarious, original, & pretty well directed. I became a BIG SWIM SWIM groupie, follow her in movie festival every time and wherever I can. I've seen it roughly half a dozen times now, and each time, enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films from year to year. In almost every festival he was screened, he was either sold out, or won the favorite award. It is clear that people like this movie, and even clear why they do. The camera is superb, the characterization and brilliant acting, fantastic finish, & the direction filled with compassion, wisdom & the art of perfect timing. It is hard to believe that Ishai Setton's first movie is. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
