Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic story of good ol 'revenge, and that's the best cause of revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The writers did an excellent job in this movie to build the relationship between Kreasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive Creasy brought rescue provided later. It was also good that Kreasy was not a kind of chorus boy trying to escape later in the "good" channels, but instead used tactical torture and street smarts. Some may say, "Torture is wrong regardless," and you may be right, but when you see the pain of Kreasy going in due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion she had to do it back, you can not helping hand side and creasing and pulling for him to be even more relentless. There is no progress if Krishi used diplomacy to deal with the different gangsters and criminals and he knew that. <br /> <br /> Question of the Creation ended and returned to her mother later with Kreasyi dead in the vehicle of bad guys. But Krasya's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, it is in fact enhanced by showing that Kreasy wanted to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in reality. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job as the writer. This film deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie.
