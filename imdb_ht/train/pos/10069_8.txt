This film is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moves acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtlet of alienation. Women and performers (both brought together in a role supporting a transvestite operative star) both must relocate supervisory role in China. This makes the bonds easy between a street scene aged and a girl even stronger than a triumph over the native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this film was the tendency of the band to swell and emotions rendered unnecessary in performing actors. <br /> A welcome alternative to films featuring satisfactory action movies.
