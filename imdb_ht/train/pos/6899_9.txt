The superb star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too little, leaps out of the screen of this witty comedy, comic, swashbuckling sly and many swords and antique knockabouts. Charmingly loop in her story, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. A single movie will remember with great affection.
