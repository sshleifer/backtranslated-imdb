A surprising rent in a local video store, I was pleased to find a satire media deserved enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Kill Baby." And almost as disturbing. I think he's going well and looking at me to be late 2004 watching the Republican car make it's magic on the majority of watching America's television watching. It brings the question "Are we really manipulative?" <br /> It's definitely skewed my view. There was also a greater theological question that provoked the story of Christ. Could it be words of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something such as television producing a Messenger? Has Christ's story been exaggerated? Could it be completely manufactured? It's something the movie puts in a very human light.
