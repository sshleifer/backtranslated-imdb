I'm from Romania I will try to speak in English. All I mean about this movie is that it is and will be my ever number one. Look at it at least 30 times and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things I love in a movie, it's very touched to make me cry. Show lots of tristed love and questions about love and reality, and the true things that matter to different people. It is so happening to me that's the most, the love, the soul of a man, its interior, and what I saw in this film. Maybe I read more than a motion picture, it is a proof of myself that it could really exist and that you do most of the best in every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way in the sci-fi reality, but .. that's right. What if all the capitalist disappeared and savings would fall down? We all should be concerned about other issues and thoughts I'm thinking about, on your dead bed, the bigger thing you remember, is not the richness, not the adventure, not the countries you've visited with those who remember you. But the true friends and your true love and hope that after dying, everyone will be God's damn perfect and people should be good and care more. WATCH this movie and probably it will guide you to your life as it made me :) Greetings from Romania
