Not if one can call this anti-war movie, it shows war at an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and take great pride in it. Even when they are pacifists, they always enjoy the skill level and beat their enemies, even if it goes against being a passifist. These films are slow and rather annoying and in many ways it is rather tame as a movie war-go more so by today's standards, no body parts fly on like in modern movies. It is brutally the other way even if you see killing at a personal level. This is the most of a man's movie thinking of. Once you start looking you do not want to miss anything. Think of the guys in the movie and their interactions, that's the movie is over- by the combat itself or a great exciting storyline. This may be called a war trek. <br /> <br /> If you are in skill of war, if you are in reading or viewing the SAS program and so on, you want to watch this PHOTO !!!!! (1965) and Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) and a cast all stars, naked and dead (1958) and Cliff Robertson. All are strange in their way and show war at a personal level. Enjoy!
