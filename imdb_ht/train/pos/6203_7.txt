A beautiful quirky film with twisting enough for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey plays fairy grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother that may or may not seem like. The story is very language in a cheek, and the dialogue is skillfully understated. Suggestions of humor and intrigue, neither in the mastery of Posey characterization pull well. Thrust in support is stellar. The downside? This movie needs all your attention, almost to the point of stop the movie and take notes. Posey has more sex appeal in her waking up in a worry than most actress there in every body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the denouement.
