In Northeastern in Brazil, the father of the 12-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sold her daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to work as a housemaid and have a life notably. However, the girl is resettled by the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who deflowers him, and gives the girl abuse of his teenager's sons having his first sexual experiences. Then he is sent to a brothel in a gold garden in Amazonas and explores his owner, Saraiva's jerk (Antonio Calloni). When Maria Night in Rio de Janeiro awaits a better life, she explores by the Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" exhibits sad reality and shame of child prostitution in Brazil in the fate of the Maria girl. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" that tells an identical story of the former Soviet Union; Therefore, this problem exists in third world countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presented a huge film to expose the reality, but never shows scenes or explicit sexual scenes. It is the first of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a child fighting scary for survival. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different it is after many plastic surgeries. Pretend and hopeless in the story is also very realistic. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
