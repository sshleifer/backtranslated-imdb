This film was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and am I happy he did! Blend of British humor (I should say, humor?) And the fact of a lost widow, whose middle age is trying to keep his life being a hood. Add to that mixture the fact of what it takes actually grow skin (these plants under the bushes were not going to do it without the TLC they got), and it's a really hilarious but touching movie. I laugh every time I admire the vision of all the bar customers sitting in lawn chairs and sunglasses on counting down the lights! Perhaps it's just bloody Mendocino County, but the brits definitely got this right !! 10/10
