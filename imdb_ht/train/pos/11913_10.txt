This is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! I think Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and a desire to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Even though it's not a movie of great value and action The Sue Sue Price is not the best of being met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a priceless gem for fans of action-body builders action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other Sci-Fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn threw into that movie a very talented body-builder who put all his energy and talent body to show us the best it can do. I really enjoyed this movie and I watched with the nemesis of the same nemesis 3 (a rather boring end) and Nemesis 4 (a more exciting end than 3). What a pity he has not shown yet on DVD :-(
