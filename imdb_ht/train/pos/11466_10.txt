I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing thing. <br /> In a way, Zero Day is something comparable to the "Blair Witch Project". It's complete completley and handheld camera. It's about 2 kids. Just your average children. Andrew and Calvin. Starting a high school campaign may be the "Army of 2". The whole story is told in Video Newspaper form, from 2 children. It shows there are relationships with parents, amongst others, showing that these are just normal kids, just like those we know or who has been hit by. We get the Army in the last 2 missions will be entitled to Zero Day. They plan to shoot high school. <br /> You see how to gain access to weapons, how to plan it out, everything. They stress that the media does not affect them all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, this is all said in Video Newspaper, and then they store the tapes in a security deposit box to be seen after zero days. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting of the cameras shows is survived throughout the school. Cool everything. This movie is a lot of cottages. Some of the things they say, how to plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself. He said "Andrew thought that they were just going to leave in some cars got off, doing so many schools across the country. I do not know what he thought, but the only way I'm out of school is in a black plastic bag" I'm probaly not even giving you good guys in this movie. You really need to see it yourself. It will be around festivals now. <br /> <br /> A +.
