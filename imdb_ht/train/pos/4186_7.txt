I watched this flicker film yesterday and I must say it's the finest horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (Padon Steckler) the movie is definitely worth looking for if you're a zombie fan. This reeks movie of soul and atmosphere. Some of the shots of zombies are best ever to engage in films. Many creeping creatures of the dust web slowly capture victims of screaming. Brrrrrrrr. <br /> Hot saggy Canadian women and sexy accents will keep you prey before the Horor stirs its undead's body to eat head. This film enters two starts to finish. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
