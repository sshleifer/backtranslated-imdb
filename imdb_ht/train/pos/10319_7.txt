Having read many of the other comments for this film on the IMDb there is officially a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books on which it is based. At this point I can not comment, it never actually read any of the great protagonists already. However, what I can say with certainty is that it hit me that much of said review must surely undergo a sense of humor bypass; Let's be honest here - this movie is just so much fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. So I must accent the point that the movie is apparently not representative of the character / s, but let's put this in a clear perspective .. to make the same ones who are taking care of on this movie too complains the fact that 1960's classical classic series is not loyal to the original DC comic book character? Or maybe there is still the same hustle of those 1980 movie versions of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes this movie is incredibly camping but that's precisely charm! <br /> Ancient Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than one resemblance than Gary Busey boots!) and backed up by a great cast of all that looked to have a ball and their respective roles . Also look out for a very short but very welcome appearance by Michael Berryman's favorite movie horror movie. <br /> <br /> Best Scene? Far too many to choose from checking out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men committed the ultimate fault coke ceremony, lemonade and letters on a formal occasion! Also the scene often noted near the end of the movie where Savage tackles his semi Captain Sea uses various martial arts disciplines that are marked on screen! ?? Présié! <br /> Simply put, the movie does not take it seriously and it's all the more fun for it. Great fun begins to finish! (and you will be singing John Phillip Sousa adapting theme songs for the next day to guarantee!)
