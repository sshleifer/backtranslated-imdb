The film was a long-awaited release, where somewhat disappointing because of expectations I had set up. When you look it again, I must say it's really OK. First of all, it's very true in the original story (of course not completely) and is like that only did keep the right for the movie. The modesty story is as a child shows and is very true to the original. The act is perhaps not the best around and the draw is a bit slim, but when you compare it to the Vitti movie 1966 movie is the best way just because it's not trying to be a music. Usually I would only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or someone who does not catch it on the TV.
