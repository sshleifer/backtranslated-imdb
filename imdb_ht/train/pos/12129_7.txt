This is a well-directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who made some fine films including the 1937 version of the 'Prsoner in Zenda'. Put in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like real things, it's a story of obsession with love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan. <br /> I was looking forward to seeing her on DVD as I had never seen before and being a great admirer at Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considering one of her early moments. So I bought it. Well it looks good, but I'm sorry to tell her fantastic accent London just makes me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, making no mistake, but here she made one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It was not as rough as accent marks of Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' but closed. <br /> <br /> In the other great role was Leslie Howard and she did it superbly. He was a subtle and clever actor actor to support themselves. Worth is watching despite Ms Davis' gym vision.
