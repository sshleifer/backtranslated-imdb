This music is decidedly mixed, and none of the components really fit together, but it somehow managed to be mostly enjoyable. The plot has some of the elements of the Wodehouse novel, but none of its virtues, though it co-writes the script. Their songs, though good, have nothing to do with this particular film, and they are very brutally rushed to the scheme, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do the usual shtick quite well, but it misses the tone of the rest of the movie by about forty IQ points. There are some highlights. Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie, and stops mug like a silent actor. And there are some bits of writings that might only have been written by Wodehouse, though most of the movie feels like the production of one of Hollywood's meetings later on parody.
