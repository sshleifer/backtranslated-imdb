I think that this movie has much to recommend, particularly a particularly disastrous performance by David Morse and a performance over the pier is not worth waiting for Mr. Foxx. Although there is a lot of holes in the scheme and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, all in all, it does for a nice time in front of the tube.
