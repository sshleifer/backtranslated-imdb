Fortunately this is a very good "end", better than the movie's first movie movie 101 Dalmatians. She has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all the right slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has some rather big therapies, is now a lover of dogs and many types. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the Cruella Dogs once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, such as Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Shelter Dog Lucky) believe he has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, dipstick, and his companion, were born of three beautiful Dalmatian dollies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> Start Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (The hilarious macarriage), Glenn Lock as Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a sign) This is a good family movie with excitement and many more !! A fall in this film is what has a lot of slackstick pain, but not quite as too much as the last movie. This is also funnier than the latest movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
