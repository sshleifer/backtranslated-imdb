One of the images that will always stay with me from this film is the masses of people who are stairwells and the way in which Thorne (Heston) has hoped to be whenever they use them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Simonson, and especially the Beethoven pieces at the euthanasia clinic are very atmospheric.
