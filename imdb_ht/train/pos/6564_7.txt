Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other film adventures that were popular during the eighties. Wayne Crawford star as Jake Speed, an adventurer who is constantly fighting evil believers wherever he goes. With his assistant, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) are cotton gloves looking for some action (with some decent story lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) of sister who was kidnapped by a white staircase trader (John Hurt). Does she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her sibling relief? <br /> <br /> A movie with cheese film that does not pretend to be something that it does not. I must give this one a recommendation. This is if you enjoy movies that enjoy having fun and for those who do not take everything in nominal value. <br /> <br /> Recommend.
