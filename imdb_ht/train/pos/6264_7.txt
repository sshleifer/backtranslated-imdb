Team Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produce a documentary of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and animals on summer migration of winter pastures. The real core of this film today is such a time capsule of a "forgotten" and how they lived during which we in the West were known as the "Roaring Wines." A more radical contrast could not be imagined. Raging river and mountain treks cross brutally realistically and the animals disappear under the water in fact dead. To ensure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place, a certificate of authenticity offered up to the end. This version that I saw was fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the movie. After saying this all, the movie is probably worth more of the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening entertainment. The team was just barely enough stock to get the shots that they recorded and no fancy camera work from several re-captures. Western inter-titles detract from the experience, but in fact part of the record have since demonstrated how Hollywood tried to put their turn on the lives of an indigenous people living so that they should be appreciated by the audience of the day. Off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "policeman's ball." The producers went on to make Chang's docu-drama (1927) and King Kong totally commercial (1933). The term migration is used again in People in the Wind (1976) and in Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance those will come in - and then highly recommend.
