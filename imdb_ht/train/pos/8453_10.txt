I could write a great comment on any one of the characters in Gundam Wings, each could lead the series and internal conflicts. Instead we get 8 great leads that take us into the 49 golden episodes of Bliss Anime. It has dialogues that you can roll around in mind for months ... years, and then return to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece of script writing (though it has the typical Anime feature in being a difference between subtitles and English dub). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own opinion. The relationship between the boys unfeeling cold and the love of female characters is an aspect standing alone in this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joyful to watch. The apparent rejection of men is insulted with an inner turmoil that makes the love (one never mentioned in the series) of women needed for their harsh soldier settings. Women are pursuing the aspect of the guys that we rarely, if at all, that makes the boys all the more enigmatic. It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but it gets there, and when it's done, it's a great pay. <br /> Then there's the giant robot battle. Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any epic scene performing Hollywood scenes. Any less clued up people would see giant robots fighting as a most fun cartoon feature for kids, as it became clear when I try to recommend this series of my friends, but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot battles in Gundam Wing have a forex dose of pathos, usually regarding young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society to make the obsolete beliefs. The constant schedules of tone and emphasis in every episode make Gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a fascinating, thought to induce study of the potential of the human mind and body.
