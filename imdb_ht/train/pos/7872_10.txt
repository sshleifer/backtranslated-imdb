The first review I saw was "what madhur bhandarkar finally meant?". It should say something so decisive. The most beautiful thing about Page 3 is that it does not take place. There is also no propaganda. This is the film that captures many angles of a problem (I do not know what I call as a "problem" here) and yet as any movie does not come with a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film ended up almost in the same scenario just as it started. The movie defines many characters completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all part of the system that is all the more unimportant. I hope I can say more, but there would be more spoiler ahead. So see page 3 if you want to see one of the most mature films in the recent times.
