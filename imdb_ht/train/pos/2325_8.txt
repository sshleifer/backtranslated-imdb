Court is trying his best to make Dani realize that the difference in age would make an incredible love relationship. Soon the Nubile charm of Dani begins to win over the will of the Court. Next came to the meeting of Dani's older sister, played by Emily Warfield, and the beginning of a short love lover / jealousy. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston round out the cast.
