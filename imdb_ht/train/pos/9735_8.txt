Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe "How to lose friends & alien people". Romans who hide in the plot are, for the most part, moved by a far more interesting "old treasure" story. Although the central line of the story is somewhat running out, in several screen shots, it has a sense of; getting the "courageous nitty" by the way, focusing on these key relationships that make "political policy" and using these almost irrelevant scenes, used purely for comical effects. But it works well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is finally very clever, plays well on the trans-Atlantic relationships Pegg shares and its co-stars and merges the cross between the high and low-life society well and well refreshed in a scenario that despite predictability is a bit in a unique journey. The different characters in the movie are presented well with casting is definitely a plus point on the movie. Both "trading places" the relationship between Pegg and Huston and "love, hate" the relationship between Pegg and Dunst work well in a story that is, to want a better, good word. Even Fox, whose main advantage is in neck sex appeals, shock and what turns out to be quite a black character and acts as "bimbo" role of all good. It's one of the films where every little detail pays tribute to a great piece of work. From transsexual scandals to an amazing band it all mingled gems in what can only be described as clever comedy.
