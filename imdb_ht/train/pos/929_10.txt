Father in Pride has shown in the best new hit TV since Family Guy. He was yet another masterpiece from talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, these centers show around a nuclear family (in white lions, in this case). It also includes many memorable supporting characters including Roger The Orangutan, The Vincent Flamingo Italian-American, the unique White Blake tigers and Victoria, Fairl Patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney the Elephant. The other stars in the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly unique and do everything in a breathtaking way, making the most fun munden activities. The combination of beautiful animal characters and very adult dialogues and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) are the source of bright program. <br /> <br /> The failure for this show's failure lies with NBC. They opted to broadcast their episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by inviting stars to be encouraged) rather than the most logical production order. Several times, the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of the following drakes as the biggest loser (as if 60 minutes of what was not enough)! It is true that the future of television such as art if an original and daring show like this fails during Factor Factors and American Idol dominates. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to get a larger one. 10/10
