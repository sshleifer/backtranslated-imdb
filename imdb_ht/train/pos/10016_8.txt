If there is one thing to recommend about this movie is that it is intriguing. Most certainly, the audience draws the audience because it is a mystery, and throughout the movie there are suggestions that there is something dark about caches. However, there is not much tension, and moderate Williams paint does not make much to do with her mania and boy. <br /> <br /> Collete fare as the woman with true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production felt running and the apparent pits. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably the best. <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really good to have inspired at least a laudable effort.
