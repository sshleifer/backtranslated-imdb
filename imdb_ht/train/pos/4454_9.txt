"Soft for dig" is a fantastic experimental horror and a lot of creepy atmosphere for reserve. This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue. A few scenes are really nightmarish and the acting is excellent.Laying is highly criticized: weird Maryland Woods are rivals that are used in the "Blair Witch Projcect" .Give this unusual horror movie a chance.9 out of 10.
