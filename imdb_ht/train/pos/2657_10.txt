"There is nothing" in room 237. But you did not get any business going 'in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay. <br /> Never had such a feat of psychological horror as this movie achieved. This movie is the highest rated film at all and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances of movies. <br /> It's about a family moving in an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter. Then the father (Jack) gets almost owned by the horrors of the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect. Vaccines control tension, musical turbulence, mysterious messages and complicated scheme to make this the best horror movie. <br /> Throughout the film there are constant references to dangers, deaths and horrors. Red is used in every scene. Does the red purse put in Kubrick? Of course! .. This is a definite Kubrick classic and this is the third of its films I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction, and you can see it in all its films. He likes to prevent his monitors from everyone in his movie. <br /> I'll talk about this movie for months to come. It has infinite depths. <br /> In conclusion, this is the stake of horror and tension. An awesome masterpiece 10/10
