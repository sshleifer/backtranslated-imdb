When I first saw "a weeping in the dark," I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what he described. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I achieved a second point: communication problem. You see, when a dingo took baby Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were puzzled but did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted this to happen, and so they could not mourn. But when people all over Australia saw the lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy had made it herself. The point is, the wrong message was communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a major accident, it always happened. It can be one of the biggest disasters in the mass media existence, regardless of the political media outlet. <br /> <br /> As for their performance, Streep does a great job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best film ever.
