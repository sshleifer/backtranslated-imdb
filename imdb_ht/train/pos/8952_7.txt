Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. In secret, she has attracted her neighbors well-known Shep Henderson (James Stewart). He drafts a spell on Shep who forced her to cast her fiancé and fall for her. Things will be together quite nicely until Gillian discovers it really cares about the mortal man. She decides to tell her secret. But how will shep react when she finds that she was "tricked" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As far as the 1950's army-hearted comedy goes, Bell Books and Candles are good, but nothing spectacular. It is a very enjoyable look and should appeal to almost anyone sitting with it. Just do not go to the movie awaiting the greatest thing since sliced ​​bread. The movie is beautiful, funny at times, and touches at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in a diskretered sort of way. Thrust in support with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester are often laugh-out-loud funny and steal a lot from the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Books and Candles can not quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a vicious comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is It a Supernatural Comedy? Richard Quine's director had stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.
