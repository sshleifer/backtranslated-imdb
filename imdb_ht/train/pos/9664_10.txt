Bette Midler presents her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am excited to stick to it and I can see each time I want it. He owns what he takes to hold a hearing of captivity. His voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. Emphasize the show was singing "Stay With Me" in his 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the emotion of the song and will end up having goose bumps. The show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
