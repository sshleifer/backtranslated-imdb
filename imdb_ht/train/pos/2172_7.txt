Earl Dog Earle is back, with her sad-mull Marie, with which Velly clubfoot angry. So they are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the peacock-chasing Putt Mutt. The only thing missing is a good reason to pick up Raul Walsh's Sierra High 14 years later without renewing a line or frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a bite or down the ladder in the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down to their credits.) The only change is that, that time, instead of black-and-white , it's Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who would count this an improvement. <br /> I've been dead once the Thousands may be needed ?? and inferior ?? but at least it's not a travesti; The story is still working on its own stagy theme. Earle (Palens), fresh from the pen near Chicago, leads west to a great work masterminded by King Rabbit Lon Chaney, Jr ?? knocking on a mountain mount resort. By the way, she almost collided with a family of Oakies, when she was hit with her daughter; The smiting holds even when it's discovered by lame. Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up, he found elevators elevator in the other's throat as well as Winters, who throws himself into him (like the pig). Living time until they get a call from the inside of the hotel, Palance (in the Winter Trail) offers to pay for a healing defective girl's surgery, a gesture that breathes. Then the surgical strike against the resort gets into a bloodstream. On the Lam, Palans moves higher into the cold Sierras .... It is an absorbing enough history, fully executed, missing Walsh the elegance and his cast brought in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and the contents of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last, heresy note: Those mountains looked gorgeous in color. <br /> <br />
