Is this your typical woman in marine transport love story? Perhaps, hell, you know how the formula works by now, beautiful women are introduced into a picture, someone has fallen in love with it. <br /> I think this movie follows some typical story lines, but that does not say anything about the content. There are big scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short. Some things did not make sense, as the need to get into random battles, but it is fun to watch, the battles were actually well done. <br /> This is definitely a comedy first, but it has a lot of fragrances in it. The well-balanced humor, you will not hurt your belly, but you will keep a smile. <br /> There is a little bit of action steamy, so not one for the kids.
