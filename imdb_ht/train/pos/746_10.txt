As I reach the "backside" of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more in gender, drug influencing genes of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me to return to my day as it is for today's youth. This movie drives that point home to the core. If you are fond of late 70's you will love the movie. From KISS-posters to a Rock Angel concert movie! <br /> Look for a young Laura Dern. Why did not there more songs from the runaways I would never know? <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While it was far from her and her friends have a part that destroys the dude's home. The cops come up with everything, but there is no mention of all the minor drinks and how these kids got their hands on this stuff. <br /> <br /> Cow that must be right there with the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the moments haunted flicks .. <br /> I say it's buying it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
