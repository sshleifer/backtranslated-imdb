While the prices have gone up significantly, and some of the details have become dating, any landlord who is struggling with the problem of homeowners should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie. I know I did. <br /> <br /> Blandings, an executive executive of New York, decided to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build a beautiful home. It gets into one hilarious jam after another, out of mortgages of difficulty construction lawsuits, as spending and scheduling of the construction keep escalating out of control. I thought that the funneling scenes were where Blandings hired a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet, but never get water. But just a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of their home-flooding! Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performance as the couple Harold Blandings overwhelmed by the issues never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's attorney and family friend. The only opposition is that social attitudes have changed significantly since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is described as a bit of a dubulb naive who has no idea how many additional problems it causes , and have a black maid (horror!). So do not watch this movie in the social lens in 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more. <br /> <br />
