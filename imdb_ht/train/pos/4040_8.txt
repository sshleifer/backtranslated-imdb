An inventive, exercising suspensions of klostrophobi. A Japanese thriller who sets himself a difficult challenge by being entirely put into two rooms. Not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well-acting. One could get the movie a bit reminiscent of SAW ?? two guys pinched in room and pitting against each other ?? but unlike his movie Oz to stay and cite it and hold the hero close to his cell throughout the movie. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some may find the tedious suspicions, but this review found it enthralling. The sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well-realized. This is certainly a good movie to use for displaying a good home video system. Just right for a late night movie late, when one is in the paranoid atmosphere. It certainly keeps me waking up this night.
