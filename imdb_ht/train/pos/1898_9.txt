The father of people in drummer alcohol, Keith Moon, named Arthur. I found numerous similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who usually oversees, did well a great job in this one, and he could turn blow to Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John has stolen absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" movie, allowing the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. We often try to keep up with this film on satellites. God rest Dudley Moore; This was such an enjoyable movie. Many saturated with thumbs down to the rich and snobbish / affluent. The closeness between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing.
