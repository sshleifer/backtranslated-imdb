Forget that this is a movie "B". Forget that it is in many ways obsolete. Instead, writers-director Ida Lupino greatly deserved credit for addressing a topic that at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. To know, this was the first movie to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that the crime has on its victims. Although much of the act of cast is the best pedestrian, Mala Power, who at that time was eighteen or nineteen, provided an excellent performance at all as traumatized to the maiden, Ann, who tried to run away from it "shame." Based on her work in this film, I am surprised that she did not have a more successful career acting. Death Andrews, too, has some good times as the minister comes out to help him. Ms Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, has always been able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit of the streets and the corridor leading to the rape, and the police program after it. And, he creates an end bitters that let me ask if Ann really could never have a normal life anymore.
