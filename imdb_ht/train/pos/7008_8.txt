WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not at all a fan of Italian contemporary director. I usually do not like play. I'm not a super fan Will Smith even think he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's like a great movie with a script like the original and good direction and that's pretty good ... wow ... it's stunning. This movie captured my minute attention by minute and I did not like "pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because I did not like acting in Will's son who is a very bad actor while the kids usually gathered all Natural actor born, I saw it last night in the "Earth Day Still Standing" and I confirm my sensation that Garden can not act). I do not want to write crowds and what I'm not talking about the story but what I can say is that talks about this movie about love, death and other feelings I do not like to watch in movies .... but this PHOTO is like a super great movie. If you have a minimum of heart you will not regret watching it
