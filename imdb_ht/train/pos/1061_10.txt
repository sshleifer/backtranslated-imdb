All the act in the first quarter was really amazing. The first look you find in Max and Zach is in Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as I like to call them the minister. The ministers do the best work to do that I have ever seen children do. The main actors and actresses Jessica Alba Michael weatherly etc. make you forget you are watching a t.v. fictional. The shows seem to make this show come alive. All of this is the best show I've ever watched
