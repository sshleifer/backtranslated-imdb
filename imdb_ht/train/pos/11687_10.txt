My sweetheart for Chris Rock varied with his movies, and I hated her after lethal 4 weapons, but I hated everybody in that movie after her. I love her when she is herself and does not hold back, like in Dogma. Well this is his best yet, did not expect this to be that good. My ass assured me all the time. Chris Rock delivers a wonderful sweet story backed by some of the funniest comedy I've seen in some time. Love it.
