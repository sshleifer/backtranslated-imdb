First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music, very lyrical, and this alone added to the movie charm. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, superlative voices by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. Whereas Fox has the Funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character (the voice of purpose), and field adds understanding to a character that is always seen hard to tell. People did not like engaging, and sometimes the movie dragged, but this is my only complaint. This is one nice-looking movie, with nice close up shots in Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, never has a serious moment, and this is the advantage of the voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a good movie and perhaps overlooked, and an 9/10 in my hand. Bethany Cox.
