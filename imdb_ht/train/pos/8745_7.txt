After high school graduates, best friends Alice and Darlene, decided to take a trip to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a good Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, she asks if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with her. They agree. At the airport though, they get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have not done. Do not really know what they have done to contact Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. The word has that if you have the money it can help you. Things start from well, but still can not get out. The movie is really good because it does not leave on what will happen and it's all fun all the time. I could not believe that the finish though. It was one of those ending where you do not know the 100% truth, but you still kind of know what really happened with Nick and smuggling of drugs because of the 'owning' etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both provide good performances here. Beckinsales performance was a bit weak though. Both Danes and Beckinsales friendship characters are good but could have seemed much stronger. Paul Walker has a small number of credits here. ;) <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and gave it a 7/10.
