This is a very good, made for TV movie. It depicts problems in the suburbia circa 1970 and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to be around. The worst and most troubled part of the movie was when the punk teens killed the family dog. Young people do everything that annoys and bothers this poor family. But boy!, The lead character takes revenge on these young punk at the end. The father / homeowner surely does not take all the punk youth from light punk light and it's quick for retaliation after lack of help from the police who is. He stands before them and protects his home and family. A very good actor .. I might add. <br /> I watch this TV when I was like 8 or 9. I've never seen it again on TV and would like it. Definitely a good one! It's sort of one movie can catch on a night night very late at night and can not stop watching or a movie movie about a weekend. It's the kind they just do not show again. <br /> It is definitely worth seeing!
