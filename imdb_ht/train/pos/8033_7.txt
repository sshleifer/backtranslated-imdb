Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seat. I do not usually go for military / war movies, but this was worth my time. <br /> It was serious, but it was also funny. Beringer's character proved heroic and honest. No matter what you know, he's got your back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zane's character develops throughout the movie. It was not just a lawsuit, it was definitely proving that he could make a hero and handle a gun. <br /> It's finished at me a little though. He did not really go with the action throughout the movie, but I'm glad I saw it, however. <br /> It's worth checking out.
