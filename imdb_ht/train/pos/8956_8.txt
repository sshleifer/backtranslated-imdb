I watched this movie after watching magic practice, and the greatest movie was far superior. I liked the way the lighting, makeup, and costume change as Gillian changed in the story. Jimmy Stewart's manifestations did not do much to me in this movie, but I suppose they served to emphasize the supply of Gillian's character. I was also struck by Nicky's and Gillian's styling - it was as if the director wanted him to appear finely and Gillian appeared masculine. Nicky's jokes do when he showed Redlich his power especially striking me. I never thought of warlocks as they were virgin, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
