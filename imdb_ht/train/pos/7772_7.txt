On October 24, 1955, the hottest geologist of the company Hadley Oil Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) met Lucy Moore's executive secretary (Lauren Bacall) in the office of his boss Bill Ryan in New York and invited her to attend a lecture with the Alcohol Playboy and the son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confessed to being traveling from Houston to New York to meet the unwillingness of Kyle's reckless, who is his best friend since childhood, to feed a sandwich out of club 21 and meeting was just a pretext of Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love for Lucy, and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress Lucy; Then she opened her heart and proposed Lucy. They marry travel to Acapulco and Kyle in insecure stop drinking. Meanwhile, Maryle's sister Kyle (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and she has a crush that does not match Mitch who sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovered that she had a problem and she might be sterile and start drinking again. Prosecutors Marylee Jalous Kyle says his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Lucy finds that she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby should be Mitch and her suspicion leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Writing on the wind" is a soap melodramatic soap opera, with artificial character and status. There are at least two major movies and characters and drugs: "The Weekend Lost" (1945) with Stunning Performance at Ray Milland and "The Wine and Roses Day" (1962) and the awesome performance of Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and motivation for his drinking and drinking character. In the end, forgettable "Writing on the Wind" is fun only and never a feature to be nominated at the Oscar. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras in Vento" ("Mo in the Wind")
