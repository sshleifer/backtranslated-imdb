Matthew and Lemmon are at their best in this one - all else in the movie are also great. The dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene where Lemmon's character tries to clear out his sinus in a restaurant has me rolling to the floor and laughing every time I see it. Anyone who has come to see the end is not so great should not turn away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character for straightforward and tragic obstruction only adds to the hilariousness of my opinion. These two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt.
