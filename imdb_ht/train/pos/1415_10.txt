I saw the German version of the movie on German TV and I was really surprised. I generally like to see documentary, but I can not remember seeing one that is better than 'Earth'. I knew some of the scenes from Youtube video that I found by random surfing. I also remember seeing part of the movie on multimedia stores, running on TV to show high definition. After seeing the movie it's clear for me why the foot is so popular among Youtube users and retail multimedia retailers: It's just awesome and spectacular that you can not help but focus on the screen, no matter if you are generally interested in documentary nature or not. <br /> There is no hesitation 10 out of 10. For sure, there are more movies, but in documentary considerations, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best in it's genre.
