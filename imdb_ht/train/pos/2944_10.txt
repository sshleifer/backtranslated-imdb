This is but the greatest down standing show ever. I saw a lot of standing show, being in a lot of standing show, and looking at the comic bet, but I never saw anyone who could match the skills of Murphy on this show. The impressions are excellent, the skit is great, and the timing is perfect. You can even say that the people really come in. When it was raw a few years later it was also really good, but this is # 1 in my book. Also shows that at one time, particularly early-at eighty nights, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show is when she tells the family barbecue and "ice cream !!! Mooommmm! The ice cream man is coming !!!!" Another great party is where her mother is like Clint Eastwood.
