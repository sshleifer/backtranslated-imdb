I'm a big fan of true movies and saw this movie because I heard how exciting it was. I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. Lead actors are scary, the never boring film, and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the Columbine killings and the home movies of the killers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the final 20 minutes that really come from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the finish really does not make sense at all. The unstable camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the movies it's a given one. But I still think the movie is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
