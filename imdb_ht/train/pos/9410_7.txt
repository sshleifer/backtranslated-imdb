I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people referring to a comedy. It was fun at times, but really, it was not very funny at all. If I'd expected it to be a comedy, I would be disappointed with the movie, but going to have no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaged. Perhaps it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire in capital or labor, and more in the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who is less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it comes to fruit and must be put into production. It is absolutely heroic when it refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return to suppress his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; Me, I compared it to the Fountainhead.
