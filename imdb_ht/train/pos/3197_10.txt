If you are a Glispin Crispin fan, you must see it. If you're a fan of Penn Sean, you must see that. If you're a movie fan in general, you must see that. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea that Sean Penn, this movie will probably still be a very valuable, but the more work you've already seen by Crispin or Sean, the best . > <br /> This movie is so funny, but it is also pure genius. There is nothing I know of similar to this movie. It is its own genre. I doubt that anything like it will ever happen again. I can not say anything more about exactly why without partially degrading it, and some of the other comments here have already done a great job in doing so. <br /> In response to any of the reviews here that gave her a bad review, I ask you to see the movie again. In fact, there is no point in which this film could be fairly called "boring." This is perhaps the most fun, the most fun, and the least boring movie ever made. And it only gets better and age and repeats look. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim their claims. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, who is also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, who is Crispin Glover also the star. They are scarce and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent search though, and there are a couple of ways to get it that I know of. But I really want someone to put this on a DVD.
