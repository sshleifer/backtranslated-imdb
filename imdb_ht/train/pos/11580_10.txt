As another review says Ganyen Hanna is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who would become the Joan of Arc. Unfortunately I divide in opinion does not agree that Miss Detmers as the lead is too nice to be taken seriously as a resident fighter. In truth for her performance she does not hold her own beauty, but she does it all most in the fear of the sadistic brutality as a resident she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, intense, sincere or understandable, and totally credible. In other words for me "In the area." from the opening credits. If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained to the Hanna War and Maruschka Detmers a try. My hat is also off Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mom is a well-known and famous actress who may have made efforts to walk on with the movie. In that it is a team effort maybe in two actress but not a All About Eve situation.
