If you have difficulty suspending this disbelief is not for you. Consider: A woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own. Think about it; It does not make any attempts to find the mother, who may well have a confused teens in need of medical treatment and seemingly no in the Italian equivalent of Social Services does any attempt to put the baby in 'care' (not has social service? KNOW it's a fantasy). Before you know it's young Toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies left in the orphanage from which he results in a loving man who loves everyone. In nothing flat he was not only giving his purse to the man who stole it from organizing the homeless local bounty resident Shantytown and for another he brought them into a fight against capitalism in the form of the businessman which buys the land on which Shantytown stands when oil is discovered. This wants some swallows without starting the 'miracles' starting with Toto's dead mother (the old lady who raised her rather than her biological one) appeared to him and handed him a dove which doubles as a magic wand that allows it to modest grants and a finale in which the flying hobos go to a better place located presumably somewhere on the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand the movie is up to here with charm and easy to easily surrender. On the balance of a ruler.
