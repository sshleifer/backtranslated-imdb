Stephen King was raised on flicks like this. -Flicks PA movie. <br /> <br /> Movies like this and 'Jeepers Creepers' are "throwbacks" in the good-day ol driving-in terrible cops. They were meant to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully: a few some good crises. Anyone looking for a theory about the human condition should pass on the characteristics of this animal because all this is ... all it ever will be. <br /> Stop garbage that has already considered itself as waste. - Good, fun, garbage! <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this I recommend: Jeepers Creepers' Jeepers Creepers 2 '30 Days In' Scarecrows' ('88) 'to Stay' 'Planet Terror' 'Death Proof' and 'Halloween III: The Witch Season
