I tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects cops heist and comedy ensembles and comments in "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie. "So enter the" ever movie movie night "! <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it has moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was familiar with the fact that it was a rumor, and as a general rule watching movies tried to ignore this fact and watch them on their own basis anyway. George Clooney put in a humorous humorous comedy as well as a cracker wheel that, for the most part, let me ask two things ... 1. would not each comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute call? and 2. How to make fake tattoos that looks old and faded, and how easy to wash in? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they have a good time working together that is crucial to a movie like this. Needless to say, do not go as planned in this movie, both draw-wise and humorous-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so , I consider it a success! Rent this one for a long time, maybe catching some friends with a pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the band is spectacular. It's great to hear far beneath appreciated by Paolo Conte, and he let me boom in the note long after the rolling credits.
