This movie is great fun to watch if you like the movie variety of organized crime. People looking for a crime movie begins a charisma pen and dreams of taking on in a bad way can be a little shameful and this way film strides. <br /> It's a fun movie of a criminal mechanism however and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movie, then you can be pleasantly surprised by this one. I was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices that made history-wise but in general a good crime movie. There are some things that have not made sense but that seems normal to the movie in the East. <br /> <br /> People just do things regardless of their personality being set up before. It is a slightly annoying pattern that is even perceived in this film.
