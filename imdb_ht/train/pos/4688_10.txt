I showed this to my 6th grade about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I liked it, too. The history of the termites and the interactions and settings are amazing. Throwing in animals is deep and they all play their part well. The battle between the two cold-blooded Titans is truly classic foot. Alan Rasin has done some incredible camera work and this should have Oscar's earliest documentary. The copy I do not have Orson Welles tells it (Derek Jacobi) and does not call "the mysterious castles of Clay," just "The Clay Castle." This makes me think he must have made and Welles added for star power and an Oscar push. I was lucky enough to get this VHS just recently and it is now my favorite kids movie. They brought him to the last family gathering instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie you're really lucky.
