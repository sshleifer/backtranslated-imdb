Extreme comedy starring Marian Davies (with Affable William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood looking for a starter. Cameo performance shows "all the stars in the sky the MGM" at the famous comedian scene, plus many of the ancient films detailing the student. Pic also captures Davies' famous bloody impersonations impersonations of the top stars of the day (its Swanson is a wonderful!) <br /> <br /> "Peggy," even catches himself as he encounters the famous Marian star Davies in tennis, turning up his nose and commenting, "Oh, I do not like it!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. History, direction, acting a native charm and a must for all affiliate silent.
