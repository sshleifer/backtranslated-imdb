Bullet machine is an amazing film of filthy, it has an original plot and love young boy, bucket of blood, and strange strange creatures that connect people to freakish war robots. <br /> Now the movie is not for everyone, who likes the movie Splatter or movie in Tetsuo: The Iron Man is applauding. Special effects can be cheeses at some point in the movie, but you do not exactly think the movie is taken very seriously but all in all it's a lot of fun, well if you get budding romance that is infested with thin tops like gobbles seek to destroy each other in the blood of alien fighting oozing.
