Well, I have admitted that I have never seen "Rhoda" with only one or two episodes of the "Mari Tyler Moore Show." Though I do not know anything about this duo of comedy talent, I still love this movie very much. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose is trying his luck in being a comedy. Rhoda struggles with a photography career. And Meredith ... what exactly does he do again? The three stories that we follow over two hours are fun and fun in their own way. When two friends meet for a long time, it only makes the movie better. I was surprised at how good the writing was. The little jokes thrown by Mary and Rhoda were funny. The script itself has been very well put together. <br /> I saw Moore and Harper in other movies over the past years and think they were pretty good. But I had no idea that this work was done well as a team. While both actresses share they meet the title of this movie, they never seem to let me down. (During the run of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their role okay but nothing great. The rest of the cast like Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone else works well together. <br /> <br /> When you that this is a reunion, you would expect a fan of either show to enjoy this. From a non-fan I still enjoy this little get-together. Good story lines for each character and two main characters are what makes this movie very good. (The newer version of MTM theme songs does not hurt either.)
