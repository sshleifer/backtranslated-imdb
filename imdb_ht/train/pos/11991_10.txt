Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that has not been said about this great show? There is nothing! This is without a doubt one of the best writing shows I've ever encountered, live-action or animation. The easiest thing is way too dumbed down for my taste, and some of the "mature" stuff I have shoo kids out of the room for. But by Talespin. <br /> History is engaging and very compelling. Some of them could even stretch for an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Storm Storm and his luck to dreams are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Then there are the best comedy episodes such as the Bluest in the Baloo Blood and stick to you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh myself in water in a few choices. <br /> <br /> The aspect of many drama misses in most shows nowadays (at least, those that are not specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. In Storm's Storm for example, Kit Cloudkicker decided that he will join a circus air, but Baloo believes that it might be too dangerous. In the biggest battles of the episode, Baloo calls at Kit stay away from Daring Dan, in which kit screams "NO! You can not tell me what to do!" '* * * * * * * * DAD *! " and glued his face in his pillow. The next day he left for the circus air. This type of drama is a rarity of a cartoon, and it would be most welcome in what they create nowadays. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depths. Baloo is pretty much the way it is in the forest book, more or less a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a business woman woman who has the idea of ​​getting money, while good in theory, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a pretty girl, but you can not let that deceive you. It can be a real hell sometimes. Whether Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. It does not trust older adults unless they are appealing, and has a tendency to break their relationship. See his expression of plunder and Lightning when it tramples the hook heavily: it seems that if he's prepared to put it right in a boat. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is demonstrated well in the candle of anyone who finishes candles when Baloo takes the word Kit for him that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with other adults. Relationships between Baloo and Becky are also realistic, due to Baloo's motivation to work out to want to buy back the oil duck, not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he did get back to duck he would still do work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is beautifully realistically born. The airline's function does not change once throughout the series (continuity as hard as it comes to), and unlike most other "super-aircraft" in other designs, there is not one single gun on the board (unless you count mango!), and it depends on its great skill in the cunning pilot to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero machine that does not have some sort of turret gun, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use themselves to get out of trouble is so hard to get into a cartoon nowadays. Plus it's just like a cool design! <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth every ten stars!
