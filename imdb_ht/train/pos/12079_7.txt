For those who think of Dame may be witty as sweet, a little batty, old lady from Hitchcock to the Vanishes Lady, this movie requires an adjustment. Here, it's anything but sweet or batty. Instead, his son, George Macready is the one loony. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and there is no cushion furniture in the house safely. Now we know what he has in mind for blocking Nina Foch if he can just get out under the domination of the mother's hand. <br /> <br /> Really tight girl-in-danger movie that keeps the suspense on high at all. The script never loses out of Foch's dilemma. He was held in prison in an old gothic house on the edge of an angry seaside. They will kill him, but why. His situation makes no sense. The tension is retained as it tries to escape from one side after another, but even strangers alike. We begin to feel helpless and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from it. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step toward the status quo with this movie and understood it. Then, too, look Foch runs subtly in a gamut of emotion without once going to the top. Witty too bright as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what he wants and how to get it if he can just keep his wacko son in line. My only reserve is the highest point that seems too optimistic to consider the time of the events. However, it's a good, nerve-wracking way to spend a little over an hour, courtesy Columbia studio.
