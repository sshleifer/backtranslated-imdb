MATADOR a (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Filip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of its best non-bonding roles as a middle-aged killer who faces a mid-life crisis while on Mexico's place where he befriends an even more remarkable American businessman (the most affiliate Kinnear it) and discover there is more to life than death. Radio Shepherd Ringer Richard Shepard makes a big big screen first with a wicked blacksmith comedy with a sharp eye for visual and nuanced visual dialogue and character development that makes it a talent to look at this breath-of-fresh-air ' comedy of friends' formula that anticipates to drive him and allows Brosnan to get him ya-yas out and spread devilish. A dirty GEM indie hit.
