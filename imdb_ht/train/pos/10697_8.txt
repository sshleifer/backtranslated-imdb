Modern, original, romantic stories. <br /> <br /> Very good acting at both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a nice job to imitate an accent Russia. Ben Chaplin is also good shy, dull clerk. For the guys (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. I forgot that a gorgeous woman is. It's not hard to imagine John fell in love with her. There are some unexpected turns of the story that are good for the suspense. Although I hope for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me. <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> The Country-Bas: points.
