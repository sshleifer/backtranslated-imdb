Ok, so it may not be the award-winning "movie of the year" type-movie (apart from the brilliant band that I think was a few premiums), but it's a really great movie about the 'Kid' Prince / O (taking your pick) and what's happening around it live in Minneapolis, playing music. The music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you have to own this band, it's really a classic and sum up the sounds Fourteen and feel in a wonderful fashion. And the movie itself plays out a beautiful draw, it's worth seeing over and over again, unusual if you like Prince / O (which I do) of course.
