It is one of the best American movies I've seen lately, instead of singing and dancing or dog bleeding movies. All actors have shown the right emotions in the right intensity and timing rights. It is characteristic of a good movie, that it makes the viewer back and search the subject, which exactly what I did to check on Harilal. I still enjoy Akshay Khanna's subtle style of acting and interesting it was rather a complicated relationship with his father Vinod Khanna, albeit not as dramatic as Gandhis and wondering how he helped him edit this character. I was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for Anil Kapoor for producing such a stylish movie.
