Two subsequent two seasons of this original series were less than substandard. The epic disaster repair season contributes to its three short life seasons. Perhaps if the plug was plugged in after the first season it would have been one such cult. Aside from that, the first season was really hilarious! Witty, clever and superb writing he promised. The first excellent mix season was the right ingredients - characters / actors, scenarios and so forth. Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was the original boots. Nora and his fellow "photographers" on the rode, night after night, day after day for their exclusive. <br /> A lot of things do not make sense to me. Like that show, and another fav in me - Brit Pointe has never "made it". If only the first seasons of the Naked Truth, and the Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please anyone out there?
