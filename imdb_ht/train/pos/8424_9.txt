This is my Bush is a live action project made by South Park creator Trey Parker and Matt Stone.The show was canceled after a season, not because of bad reviews (it actually got good reviews), but because it was very expensive. This bush I am a very funny parody of an average network site site.It is also a political satire. Now this is nowhere near as good as South Park, but it is a pretty parody silly in a sitkon and also a very good political satire. Guys who play in this bush are very similar to him! If you can find the show, check it out. There are plenty of laughter to have had! <br /> 9/10
