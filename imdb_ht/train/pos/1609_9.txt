"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched it. I really like it a second time. I liked it the third time. Now it is one of my favorite time. The humor is subtle, but really good. The film offers a lot of humor humor. The story takes place in an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. Cher Cher's for love is enjoyable to watch. This film is, far, the best work Nicholas Cage made on film. The old man character is fantastic. It lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dog screams of the moon was fantastic. But perhaps, the best character is one of the plays by Olympia Dukakis. The highest point of the movie is a scene where the main characters have it out on a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Outstanding direction and wrap up.
