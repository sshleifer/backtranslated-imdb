We loved the movie. I'm a mother for two boys. I love having a movie I can look at with people's integrity and character. Bad money is not the most important thing. And the family forever and love means more then words. <br /> I want to see more of Davis's family. But over all I liked she left me and the same feeling the others were "please do not be on". We both want actors would not change. The new operators were good to replace tho. <br /> I'm 9 years old son liked this movie too. ask me to buy them all. It's a movie critic so he says this tells me something. Families should all see this move to buy it for their friends. Help bring back a time of value. We'll read the books now that we're hooked. really hope to see more. May happy happiness moves
