If you've ever seen the trailer for the movie "Recruiting" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never have to see that movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance had revelators' trailer musicians. The Renaissance History is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researchers. The environment is a futuristic Paris, with science fiction elements presented at all. Special thanks to Renaissance, though, is its visual style, and it's not its history. Renaissance is 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with ultra sharp sharpness. The result seems stunning (although the problems of 3D animation of human beings are still apparent from time to time: a little robotic movement, a little sticky acting act, etc.) As a highly stylized, beautiful movie noir, Renaissance succeeds stunning audience, especially visually. The story and writing, though, are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals. It's not a bad story (and presumably, if you did not see the trailer, it's a lot more interesting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original, and writes about the trim. A few lines in the dialogues were corny, making the sound written as the first beginner's effort. <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. It's unlike anything I've seen before, visually, and I believe its originality alone makes it a refreshing experience. It is also a look history, though it's not perfect.
