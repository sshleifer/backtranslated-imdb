First, I'll give my rating to the overall series; ******* 7 from the ten stars. I've been hijacked three to slip down this set of sufferings following Jan Amos party. Do not get me wrong there was hard hit episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle leaves for a season and back. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a really great site-com (and dramatic harmony) first on CBS. It was a first television, a show about a African-American family living in the Chicago projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a turn-off of "Maude", he once again hit the right code and viewers. <br /> Not since this show I saw a comedy situation directly speaking about the struggles of family inside the city. (Well, there was Fox Central in '94 but was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father figure for this family and act as any father should keep his family and his kids from going down the wrong paths of life. Esther Rolle was a wonderful non-mum figure of the same page as her husband when he became the kids edition. Ralph Carter as Michael is a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the founder of Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on the "Jeffersons". (Mike Evans passed away in December 2006). Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and she faced with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is typical young wise-cracking, jiving kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes with Jan Amos, with the exception of the Gordon / Janet Jackson story line Penny Jackson line story. <br /> After breaking into character James Evans, the show loses its stability and viewers have gone. Esther Rolle leaves for an entire year, does not want to play second play for the JJ's smart-aleck "Dyno-Mite"! <br /> It was coming back next season, after guaranteeing a warrant that the writer would have the same thing out. Florida neighbors Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who ended up adopting a girl abuse girl Penny Gordon (played by a then 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's mother was abusive to play by Kim Fields's Totie Fields. <br /> In August of 1979 the show came to an end, and all left their projects for a better life. JJ was the artist selling an idea to a comic book-book, Michael went to live on college campus. <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma & soccer player Keith + Florida players all moved to the same building in downtown Chicago. Not the most realistic end but at that time it did not matter.
