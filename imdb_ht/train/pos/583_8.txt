In a small town in Montana two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Fathers are Reverend Maclean and grow up with their lessons made with religion, and the lessons of flying-fishing. In this fly-fishing movie represents life, a little bit. The story is good and keeps your attention while there are some moments you need a little action. Probably the movie has the moment because it's not really about the events that happen, but about the message. There are some things that happen though. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years she returned and became involved with a beautiful girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and she was invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and recognized as the "fishing reporter". She is famous and she seems to have a nice life, but she drinks a little too much with too many players. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well-directed, it has a nice score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this film is movies. The mountains, the woods and the river all look very beautiful. If the movie was just for things it was good enough to look. Fortunately there is more.
