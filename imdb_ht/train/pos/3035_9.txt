MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man Douglas MacArthur. This is of course, the story of one of America's great military figures, and a figure made out of the earliest moments of my memory. Even if there is a continuation problem (maybe others) e.g. MacArthur's speech was shown in the movie as his 1962 address to the American Military Academy on Acceptance Thayer's premiums did not have the phrase "the old soldiers never died, they just fade away." (That was in his speech at Congress on his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for alleged insubordination (of which they did not see the eye sight!) Gregory Peck is im-peck-able as the general promised he would return to the Philippines in the Second World War. The film moves quickly and easily with the General, his family and his staff since the beginning of World War II at the end of his service career. This film would have more meaning in one familiarity with both WW II and the Korean War. But Peck's paintings of the great man who fought twin evil in fascism and communism and those who hated war as only a soldier can be one memorable indeed. "In war there is no substitute for victory."
