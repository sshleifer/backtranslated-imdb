This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, better than what I already anticipated. He was definitely a spectacular film-wrenching movie. It's an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another big movie with Denzel Washington. (should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a wonderful thing as well.
