Kubrick again put on his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a movie. Mostly in cinematography, but also using an ingenious note, it creates a cool and threatening tone that resides on the movie all and well becomes my spine tingling from the start. It really is this impeccable ambition that makes the brightest ruler that he is, in my eyes. Of course it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A native perceived portraiture of a mind going mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be beautiful, but it's easy to look past these when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor and the greatest name ever (Scatman Crothers).
