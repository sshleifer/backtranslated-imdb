Sad movie pre-code, really the one movie that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code was forbidden to enforce. Barbara Stanwyck star as a teenage girl whose liquor-selling dad has no problem pimping it out to customers. When he died in an accident, he was released from the world with the knowledge that his nubil body can find him whatever he wants. He goes to New York and continues to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously no actual sex is shown, the film is quite sleazy. Unfortunately, after the first trauma value chain (around Stanwyck's time vice a rail car inspector so he can travel for free), the film becomes a repetitive and dull tad. Stanwyck himself is the only thing that keeps the movie worth sitting in. As always, it's fantastic.
