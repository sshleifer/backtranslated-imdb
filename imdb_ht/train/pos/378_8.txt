These days Spielberg's "Purple" is especially remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zimbabwe. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself did not even name for Best Director. Needless to say, the movie-makers deserve more reputation than they have been assigned. <br /> The story of anxiety trials and tribulation at Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominates in the first by his incestuous father and then by his abusive husband. The film targets many years and focuses primarily on Celie's relationships with women around her. He says out of a Sunday girl face but you do not fear that she's a chick 'chick' movie. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting, lively and humorous one although times the central character struggle is essential. Some can not appreciate the change in tone for movie ends but I did not mind though the same content in a movie less would be likely to roll my eyes. The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly worthy and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiff. As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. As a supposed candidate of belief, since Spielberg's leadership here is top-notch. I'm not particularly crazy about Quincy Jones notes but it's not under average by any means. <br /> In the end, the story is one meets, well said by a movie-maker master working at Pulitzer Prize-winning material. Give it a try and you will probably be as disgusting as I am about how it might be so badly treated on Oscar night.
