While I loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit the theater set my expectations somewhat high. <br /> I own the DVD, so do not get me wrong, I do not say not to look it or even buy it! It's just that I always thought that the first scene was the best, and nothing in the movie ever topped it.
