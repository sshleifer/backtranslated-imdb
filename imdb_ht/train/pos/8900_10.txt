This is an awesome classic monster cops from the 50! I just love looking at 50 in general like the cars and the music. Anyway, I like the way the blob looks like. I love when everyone is in the late thunder film in the theater and the patty comes in and crashes the party. Another thing I like about it is that it takes place all at one night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are making out, they see a fall meteor in space. Inside the meteor is the blob. Each time the blob eats someone, it grows bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the city about the blobby monster, but no one believes them later. Does anything stop this blobby animal? I highly recommend the blob !!!
