This is an amazing movie. As well as current footage of key events in the coup failed to chase Chavez, we received the background picture depicting a class-divided society. Many of the rich, it appears, have a choice and democratic choice of the people, and they want to use the military to change the regime. 'Be careful what you say to your servants' is a revealing comment. The head of the nation's largest oil company has appointed itself as the new president, with US backing, and these young Irish movie makers have it all on camera. A great movie educated young people about democracy. We see transparent documents on how the media can manipulate, and use force, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic people wanting the people. Rivers stuff.
