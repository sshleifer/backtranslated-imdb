This is a wonderful movie, making the 1950's look very beautiful stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch and one foot in Manhattan and another in Infinity. All the performances supported are terrific, from Jack Lemmon as he bothers Nicky Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico who works on magic in Manghattan, Elsa Lanchester as a little batty as well as witchy Aunt Queenie. Then there is the cat - I have no idea how many witches (besides I) are called a cat Pewacket but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is from pps; ace in this unusual sub-world of magic and magic. Do not do. And it has perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe in because the ancient cinema has these cheerful endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as Rose and Charlie Allnut of the African Queen (another big movie)
