Kurt Russell is strong and (mainly) silent in futuristic action-driven actions from Paul Anderson (Horizon Event, Evil Resident.) Put on a garbage dump-planet, soldiers play as a cross between Rambo and Shane, and Russell barely spoke as title character, a "solo" genetic soldier left to die. Throw the colonial support, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly over Michael Chiklis, can. They spend most of the film being scared to Russell, and the rest of it runs for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he ever gave. With almost no words they say, it transmits emotions, feels and meaning and looks like glances. It is almost a mime performance. When the sequence kicks off the gear, it kicks donkeys - and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of-fact way. There are defects. Jason Scott Lee is brutally as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a big impression of Frank Burns in M ​​* A * S * H ​​as a captain of Weaselly captain, and Gary Busey barks a bowel (and almost busts his belt) as Todd's adviser. This is a balcony, with excellent flick of sci-fi, and recommends anyone wanting a second visit to the universe of knight blades - David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays.
