Also, it universally acknowledges that symmetry many blinds have been influenced by Kolchak's episodes, they are, they will, if this make it a rip-off or homage is a complete more controversial point. As a great fan of both my series subscribe to the latter's belief, although the less charitable can not do. James Whitmore was brave to take over the task of directing such a tough episode, invisible elephant and gorilla suits as a recipe for disaster, but pulling it off with style, the neck being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader to see with threats as Ed Meecham. Forget the original originality symmetry of originality and just enjoy it as a X file to meet deeply.
