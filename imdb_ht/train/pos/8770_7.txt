I mean that in a good way, believe me. True in life, it's not. Everything Oirish's stuff gets thick, but you enjoy the cast here-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All right. I also like to see Mike Mazurki-of course he plays a boxer, what else? Typical flickering quiz teeming w / face familiar with fast paced scene, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn is good as Jim, you never get past a 1 dimension in her or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and to say that please, that's all. Boxing scenes were very good, Ward Bond's Vaudeville venture acting a riot and you were gang like seeing all of these Billyclub touching sponges coming racing at the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Really fun, Flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear why her audience liked it. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
