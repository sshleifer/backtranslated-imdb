A type of road movie in the old-fashioned train in Slovenia extends summer to the province. In the beginning you see someone in leather elbows pants in black cloth, and when even the young man in his black pants leaves and two handbags, you see that the pants-party is missing on a flag of mourning (appearing dad he has died). In the train it meets a young lady, and almost without words, but very little gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It's somehow surreal, very poetic, and a tiny movie, with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures and love for beautiful details.
