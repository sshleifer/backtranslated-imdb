This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even quite well, some things are obviously the private jokes or regional symbols. I guess is that he tried to send a message in some sort, but that just was wasting me. <br /> <br /> What I felt is basically this is a mediocre film and beautiful special effects. Some kid gets the "one" and in the end there is almost no importance in a yokai war that does not make any sense anyway anyway. It would be good to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi washed yokai and the one that looks like a big tongue in tongue (Rihanna feeds your heart out!) I could not really discern the plot. Br /> <br /> Bottom line: Beautiful visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible and the rest is crap.
