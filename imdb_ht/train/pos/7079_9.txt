I really like this - I'm a big fan of movies that mess with yourself and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas of debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is still good at that (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwocky and Grimm brothers, for us?). <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the way it occupies the term travel time and avoids in paradoxes - the road event of the past and future tied with food to each other. <br /> It was also really good to make aesthetics - the art direction was really great, and I wish I could see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a similar feel in Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling. <br /> But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that featured two actors I normally do not like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially - I'd see one or two films before that made me realize it could actually actually act (contrary to what I would have originally thought), but this one really outdid them. I actually found myself asking my friends at a point "Are you sure is Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though admitting that can not say too much).
