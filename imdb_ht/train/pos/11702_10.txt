A thief in the night had to be the best out of all times to frisoners times. I have no indication that people are complaining about what they are saying about when they say that these scary movies are in accepting God. They just need to get an excuse and blame a thief in the night. Do not listen! These films not only say in one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but they are also pleased to look into their simplicity. They are in fact low-budget and that's a little obvious but not all too obvious on first glance. I had no signs because I really assumed that a lot of movies like what they did in the 70 included low-budget all the time. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Myers Patty who lives for what comes her way, until her husband, and almost all his friends disappear from all the prophetic raptures warned him about. At first, the film is not all based on it until the rapture occurs. What he leads up to shows that all others around him will become Christians and believe in Christ, which is usually what happens to a lot of people. All around them once knew and love they will go forever, and those who leave behind is the one who blames everyone, but themselves. No one can ever blame themselves because they are always right. <br /> Just like those grapple who complained about the movie. These people must be adult full of adults. I thirteen, and you do not see me shining, especially since I was exactly like Patty before I re-accepted Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a little bit of everything in a Christian movie instead of stereo-typically everyone else is evil movies, than you'll enjoy a thief in the night. Do not hit it before you try it. Something new is always good. Believe in your own instincts.
