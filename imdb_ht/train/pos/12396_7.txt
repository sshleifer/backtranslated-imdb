This is the second part of the 'Animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tells us a little more about the world of 'The Matrix'. In this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together. It's a little story lesson in the world of 'The Matrix'. Not as good as the first part ('The Final Flight of the Osiris') but still pretty fun.
