RELATED EVENTS - In some ways, "How to align Your Friends ...." is the "learning deficit to adjust, become successful and find that something else is more" kind of story, located in the business celebrity. - DOES THE SPOILER <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy delivers many good moments. Even though I think the end is flawed. It felt too fast and too stiff, as if something was missing. Besides I would say the movie can not keep a high level. Apart from this you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses and sometimes controversial kinds of acting. Until now I have never seen any Pegg different. Still it is a very unique kind though on the screen it sometimes might seem a little more tiring than necessary. Fox proves she is able to play a hot starlet and herself in the clouds. Do not know if it was a hard thing to do, but its performance was hot and better than the "transformers" (okay ... probably this is no hard match). Kirsten Dunst is a lot of Kirsten Dunst (again) and you can love it (as I do) or find it annoying. On the other hand you will see Anderson who has proven his skills to act with Jeff Bridges (who is good, but maybe he could have acted a little more powerful). They all fit the characters well enough. <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice celebrity comedy with some more and some less funny passages, a sweet cast but a sudden ending too sudden.
