Of all the films of the Seventies, there is no capture in the true sense of the good fight against evil as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were cinemas like the exorcist, and others; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this one out. You can not get past the devices that are dated as such, but this is a story worth to enter. Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be the stars. My absolute favorite was Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle clues that lead to what's going on. Pay attention attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on at least the youngest statements like 'black and white cats, black and white' cakes. Plus, the books are really good as well. I just regret that they're not going to turn the second book into a movie. He is so scared that he would be outside this film.
