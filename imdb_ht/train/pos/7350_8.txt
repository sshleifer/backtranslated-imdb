Well I was a teenager when I saw the movie .. The songs were a big hit but the elite class jumped govinda movies back then causing watching govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies was not in of stuff for 'class' but nevertheless a lot of people liked it as the series of these cinemas launched the 90's out and most of them were successful .. today I watched it again after a long time and I remembered , there was a time that the people and the riot were created when aa u uo uo o singing came on screen ... the dresses of govinda and karishma were flattering with each other (the worst duo dress up this time) quite karisma in the late 90's transformed, but govinda was still very loyal to her designer as her sense of dress remained the same ... but back then she all entrusted it all .. all The thing worked with slowly the elite class to realize what fun she was missing and then ..... there was no back looking for this today as it went to n on doing these Americans We carry on series .. was ... not a few but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time and nothing to rent it or watch it on TV I do not think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst of its best. Still, I watch those movies when I find time because I cant stop laughing ... so i say go ahead and have a good time that there are times when we all love to sort and especially when it does not The kings of the times it surely is watchable ... I recommend it to all movie lovers.
