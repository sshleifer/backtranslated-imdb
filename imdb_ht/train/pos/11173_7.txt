Ah, click, knock, knock; They are a major part of a wide variety of horror films. This one, there are a lot of them. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This film was really good, just TOO predictable. And which horror movie does not have anyone stupid? This is a over-the-counter and delayed practitioner just practically begging for life to be taken. Pet Semetary I found to be climbing a little. Ways everything to set up was really spooky, but not foolish. For the most part, the act was SOMEWHAT credible, the suspense was not thrilling, but the level of entertainment is set in a larger rank; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All fans of Stephen must see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect an OKY thriller.
