As I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watch this online movie. I thought it would be just another "B" movie rate but I was amazed at the act by the two main characters. All of the actors in this movie were very capable and well-directed. The plot was beautiful and unique as well with an excellent moral in the story. This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex movie, "Mute and Dumber" or Blood and Intestines. This is a very impressive movie that shows some gloomy reality in life coupled with kindness in the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting. <br /> I prefer this movie to many "A" movie cinemas I've seen even a large number of high office desk salaries. <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
