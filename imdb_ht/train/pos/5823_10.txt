In the Micro Phonies stooges are at best. In this small knife is handymen working in a recording studio. They ended up looking at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing the voice in spring. The voice is amazing. Curly in tir is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). MOE appeals to Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three stooges end up in the Curly party that will be dressed in shooters. They play a record on their voices in spring and all that will be fine until Moe destroys the record on the curly head. They end up using the sexlet lucia until the baritone acknowledges them and unplug them. Alice Van Doren captures the boy crying and hiding behind a curtain to help out. Everything is fine until the baritone wonders how Curly is singing without help in an outfit discovered Alice behind the curtain. The three stooges are revealed to be scams but Alice's dad discovers her daughter's talent and agrees to be a singer. The Celti stooge comes out of the room. Excellent.
