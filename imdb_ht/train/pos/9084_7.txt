Yes, some people said that this movie was a waste of money, but I am the kind of dead dragon / world-ending / holy movie fan film. <br /> But if you take it from my point stand this movie has some of the best actions being pretty good. But it's the kind of movie that everything just falls hard at the right time, or just about when wrong was something sick to fall in to save them at the right time. Though there were some funny lines and gang of the movie that surprised me. The 3D graphics were pretty damn good. I mean for this kind of movie the 3D effects were GREAT !!!! Big battles that were shown in the trailers live up to whatever the film's hype was. The fight between good and evil at the end was, I meant being longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good. Now, on the parts that I think could be better. The beginning was very good showing the parties leading up to the big battles. I mean if you do not really want to go see this movie then then at least this is a DVDer ... <br /> in general I liked the movie, but the draw just fell into place fast and fit stronger only in well.
