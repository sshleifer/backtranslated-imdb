This is one of the best movies ever to do. It is a realistic realistic rural rural illustration that was a great part of American history. The environment is 1902 Wyoming where life has not changed much since the previous century. The film keeps your interest without added Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued by how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation. With this movie, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work required to survive, as well as the constant concerns and anxieties of the components and the market pressure that will make a difference between success or failure. See this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth the time you see. My only question is - why not have more movies like this one?
