This is one powerful movie. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it difficult for me to understand a lot and lose the viewing experience. I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD, using English subtitles when I needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. It is excellent. The widescreen photo makes it spectacular in part, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminds me of Braveheart, a story that involves good against evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Some actors come across as jerk like Roth. Man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, looking irritating. (It is so embarrassing and poorly criticized to love his character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man's man with a solid hero face as Gibson was at Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead. The film draws you in and gets you fully involved, so prepare to have an emotional look experience.
