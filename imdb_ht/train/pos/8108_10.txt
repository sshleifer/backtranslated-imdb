I have, "Things come," on D.V.D. and it is very clear compared to my VHS version. The audio is just, but they can be hard to understand at times. <br /> I loved the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. It gave details about why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little ones that I did not notice first. Like John Cabal playing with a game airplane in a party Christmass, as it was a dive bomber, out sea power by appointing a battleship, "Dinosuar." Boats shed by air-power, a secret dark enemy attack by plane. Sweep fly plane plane. Strong rolls for women in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> There are more, see the movie enjoying them.
