I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video distribution, I am even able to engage in the past of all the big star trek episodes. For those who do not really look at every single episode and know they are not hearty, the TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., general consensus folk will say - "I love the next generation" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were cool when they first appeared after decades of star Trek trek. But to be honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager episodes more than TNG. The Voyager episode also progresses in time unlike TNG. Grant Data from TNG is great but it eventually becomes old but the Voyager's doctor - now this creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence left and jerk, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagine. Not only is Picardo as a great actor but the environment cites for her growth, self growth, as a physician, self-realization now that science is its best! Endgame shows him as a married husband with an "organic" invention, neuro-implant transfer invention for human-interface interface, and even - in the episode before Endgame, disobeying Captain's orders and making "human" mistakes. Unlike DS9 who is blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, Voyager has to survive 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo who has brought with his personality. Of course the left-wing chemistry throws the Voyager just flowing, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I like Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so happy to get rid of that original female commander - oh, if you get to look the rare feet - thank God for Kate! She has been developing in the 7 years of a very confident, credible, and respectable female. What a great job! Thanks Star Trek to Voyager, I enjoy every episode, creative exploration of possibilities, of morality, and of our cosmic arch.
