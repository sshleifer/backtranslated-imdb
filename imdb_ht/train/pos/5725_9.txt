This is what I wrote to some earlier friends: <br /> HOLY CRAP, Grudge is, honest God, one of the horrible films I've ever seen! I either get so much in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Holy Photo made a KICK A ** job! (Can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> I was scared to sit down in the dark theater and wanted to have someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist of Grudge. .) I swear, there were so many great scenes that were not expected! I felt crazy, but my nerves did not care! I was on the whole movie, out of the open credit, and the music was fantastically scary. I always think that sounds, but I do not like it! <br /> I actually gasped quite a few times, and they called, "oh" in one scene !! Oh, yes, I'm half-covering my eyes a few times! The wise word, though: I thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. DH hated Horizon Events and thought that the writer was ill with psycho, but I do not remember the movie so it can not be compared. <br /> I can not say I "enjoy" this movie b / I was terrified, but it was very good and scary. The scene ends, too ... whoa! To be a 32-year-old mother, I think I can have nightmares from this film, especially because of this sound. Please get out of my head;) In summary, this is not a slasher flashlight as I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a most-time-spooky movie. Perfect for Halloween. Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and the ring 2 !!
