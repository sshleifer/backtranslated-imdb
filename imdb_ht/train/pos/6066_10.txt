When I saw this movie first, it was long ago about VHS-Video. I did like this movie, because it was funny and interesting. A few years ago I saw another film, called: * Incredible Adventure Andy Colby * In this movie were part of the * Wizards lost kingdom * used in. This film was named "The KOR Conqueror". I started searching for "KOR" -Movie many years, because I wanted to see the movie full, not just the party used in the * * Colby * -Movie. There is no store in this movie for rent and no store has made this movie. Many years I watched old VHS tapes I was in the house, and what a wonder ... I had this movie for many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because Germany has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape in the house and this time I had more time to watch the * KOR Conquerer again. The music is great during the movie hole, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is the moment when KOR is walking drunken in the green forrest. The music in the background was some kind of magic. I love Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
