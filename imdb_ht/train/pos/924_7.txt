Papa's pride is a wonderful surprise: It's funny, witty and features some great voice acting. The show is about the family of a lion who acts as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows. Indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon it contains some rude adult humor but in a very mild manner. It is full of population references and celebrity celebrities and most of them are very well executed. I would say I'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is pretty fairly well executed, but not very original, I've seen most of those stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
