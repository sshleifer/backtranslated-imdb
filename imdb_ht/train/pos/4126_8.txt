What a night. Perry Mason then Guns, Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when he was half an hour) and finally at 10:30 PM to Hunt Hunting with wonderful theme opening tune with Mike's Pirate to navigate through a new adventure . Terrible .. Whatever the story it was the lead character (played by Lloyd Bridge), strong, honest, sincere. A man in Man and a boy's man. This has brought about an interest in the ships lasting for years. Why not show on cable or make it available on video, no idea .. Too bad.
