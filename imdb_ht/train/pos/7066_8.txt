This movie is so old I never realized how young Mr Rayand looked at in 1936, I remember playing in a big movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays role Michael Stuart, who is a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and finding out their father will be married to a young blonde who is a gold digger just looking for a rich rich sugar. They hire a man posing as a very wealthy count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who drinks all the time and is penniless and gives many funny laughs throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) seized everyone when she was booked at a police station and told the police chief that he was an opera star and then Penny started singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have all heard , the entire police department and prisoners began to applaud, which was a very fun and enjoyable scene in this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first debut film and it has become an instant success on night and goes to become a big movie star and Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
