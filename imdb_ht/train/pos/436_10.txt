I absolutely love this movie. I do not even have it particularly, but I think it was nice and should be available for DVD. The foreign women and again arrived together quite enough to spend the time they were doing in the villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were all different and yet clever stories that made it work. There are humor, drama and relationship problems all at the right time. This requires 10 lines but I just can not think of any more to say so I'll just roots on until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. What else may I say was a long time since I last saw it. I'm looking forward to seeing again but not available.
