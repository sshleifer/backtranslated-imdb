What a wonderful surprise: A Disney DTV (direct video) is that's actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy act involving everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts out and they watch the original movie and comment, until Timon complains that "we are not here again". After fighting on the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decided to tell the audience the "stories". They start the new movie, and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I have lost hope in Disney. Most direct-to-video prices have been aggressively awful, and the storyline's desperate storyline of cash on the original. "1 1/2" decided to try something different: It tells the original story from a new point of view. Well, it adds some things, such as where Timon came from and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly retrieve the bond and friendship that made us love the movie first. There are also some clean movie parody (including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly' and 'Cool but Luke'), and the script complete with memorable lines. The cast is Julie Kavner (the "Simpsons") as Timon's anxiety mom, and Jerry Stiller as a little crazy Uncle Max Timon. Matthew Broderick shows up as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminds me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (that's how you spell it?) As Rafiki, who hesitates more and more Yoda-speaking in this movie (Timon commenting on this several times). King 1 1/2 'is a perfect alternate choice for the person you are getting tired of the shredding of animation. 10/10
