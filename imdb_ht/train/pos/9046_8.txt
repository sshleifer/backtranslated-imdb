I saw first Jake Gyllenhaal of Jarhead (2005) shortly back, and, since then, I've been watching every one of her movies that happened on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, it has an intensity (and it even looks like Owen a bit) just oozes out of the screen. I feel sure, if it lands some meaty roles, it will crack an Oscar one day ... <br /> This does not delegate this movie to all. fine story, and very credible people (well, it's based on the early chancellor and rocketry), a great throw ?? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is still on my watch list ?? and appropriate mix of humor, patoj, excitement ... and the great soundtrack and many old n rolls get tangled. <br /> But this movie has a very special meaning to me: in 1957, I was the same as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as he scudded across the shadow; like Homer also, I experiment with the yard in my yard and use the same chemicals for gas; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts to finish explosive disaster! What fun it was ... <br /> I did not realize big (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But that's what you get out when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dead crossword these days, it seems. Take the time to view it, with the kids: you will all have a lot of good laughs.
