I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had much to go through in his life. First of all I did not know Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mentioned in women being privately owned with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of women in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. The film also had a lot. I also do not like Leon playing the part of Little Richard, she's a good actor but I feel that the party should go to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard. I also totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was part of. From the movie he was photographed as a sexual addict. In today's time it should refer to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a pious. I do not want to break the movie for someone who has not seen the movie however there were several things on the movie that I feel should not be part of the final cut.
