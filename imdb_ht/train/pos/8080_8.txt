Well, I get used after some time to comment on those movies that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. It was a dead-hard villain, a no-exquisite villain. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy was not sort of off in some ways. <br /> <br /> The kid who played Aryan was probably on his head with this cast. I think perhaps the director could do better. But to be honest, the very best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. It is a brazen heroine, a true veteran thespion who is overqualified for every role she offers. But I must say I appreciate her contribution much as she played the VirTra Sahi wife. He can do little to do, but he does everything with conviction. I'm sure he has embarked right on top of most of the audience. So if you are in a habit of solving for Bollywood's average, you will not get much out of this movie. But if you are still looking for something more, then this might give you some of what you missed.
