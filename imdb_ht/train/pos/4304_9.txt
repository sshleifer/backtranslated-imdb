I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the moment it shocked me. I saw a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences of violence. This film does not only show it, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose early. What this movie was doing and crash failed to do was veridik. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and accident actually had a bias in anti anti Asian) and came to it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon has come to such things from such a real and real perspective that it actually ends up on a land that is high than crashing. Especially when you compare the endings. Ending the crash is this supposedly neat little finish that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing is much changed in the character's life but that's because life just goes over, there is no proper finish. No matter how good ... bad you are. There is no end in a chapter to start another.
