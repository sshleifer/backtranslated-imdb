As a comic book reader, who always sees myself as a kid in the heart, I admit I might be a bit partial towards this movie. I mean, there was not a good superhero movie out for some time (NOTE: Batman forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent travels in the movie (it's Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Men Mystery was definitely not a side effect, tense-filled action flicker action, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. She had everyone in the theater small theater, and got applause and laugh right at the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch to crazy. William H. Macy plays a straightforward man, while Kel Mitchell and Fart-Paul Rubens added just to keep their kiddies happy. Though these sets are rare (and at times seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade runners), and some of the obvious jokes, it's still just plain funny. Some lines will catch even the most jaded off-guard, and bring tears from the stomach from you. <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although not a classic all-time, it is twice as funny as the last retina to Austin Powers. Write this good, and the cast is GREAT. If you're worried, plan on the morning and pay less, but either your way will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, that among us is not rooted for the losers once in a while?
