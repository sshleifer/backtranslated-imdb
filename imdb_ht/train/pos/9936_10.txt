This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcasting company has decided to broadcast it once a couple of years ago when I just finished my first semester at medical school. I was surprised to see the depth explaining the organs. Sure, some things have been simplified but most of it was incorrect (though it did 22 years ago!) And well understood. I would suggest that all medical students should look at it. It is a great way to learn some of the basic medical words for example. Now I'm in my seventh semester and I think I'll watch the series once again as soon as I bought the DVD-box :-)
