How this has not become a movie I do not know. I think he was sadly neglected as a really ingenious comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to pass itself as a fast-paced comedy, but takes the quality of acting (good god of evil), the scenario, the practice of possession of the machine's demons and scenes In the baby's evacuation account there is nothing you can really do, but laugh. And laugh you will. The films are made to entertain you, and the degree that they do this can be an indication of a movie's worth. This movie is the pinnacle of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I received short breath and almost choked, it really is that funny at some point. When the baby was aircraft from the sunroof to a holdall by a helicopter and a robot pilot that managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car with a flat plain flat flat which meant that the hook graft did not rip -Hack machine in piece, I laughed hysterically. But when the baby starts to swing around in the air, almost hit a bridge and almost was tangled in a tree, the tears ran down my face. <br /> It also happened to me that the black cop was guy who played Jesus in Madonna's Like Like a Prayer video. It seems to find everywhere.
