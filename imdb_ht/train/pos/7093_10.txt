With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably get a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time travel. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 with a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a remedy for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. She is also a psychiatrist of Doctor Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe her in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while she is chained and locked in a room and re-emerged in 1996 Kathryn begins to believe Cole's story. The movie is still playing with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, he picked up in the future and "they" sent someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you have to be careful. You can ask some questions, but since you can not have a response yourself it is best to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkey' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You're never sure of what will happen next and help the movie. Let's have some flaws in the story, but since it's about fictional as it's time to travel, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. It was the easiest part for me.
