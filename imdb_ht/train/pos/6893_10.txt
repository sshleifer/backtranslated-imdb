Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, comic, sensitive, brave and lover. It gives a superior dimension to a movie that is even a prince, like many by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as by the story or the rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French movie ever.
