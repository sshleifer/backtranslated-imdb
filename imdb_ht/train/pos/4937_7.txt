This film is actually significant even today given the threat of bio-terrorism, with the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than service roles. The domestic scene between Widmark and his wife gives a nice interlude to the main draw. The actor in this movie who left his mark is Jack Palance. Its well-defined features and seemingly exterior still fade ways to reveal the bad and cruel man under the surface. The chasing scene at the packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
