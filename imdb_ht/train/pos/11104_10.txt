As the godfather legend was looked into the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the point of view of the working person. If you've never seen this show, you're in for an extended treaty. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and needs contrast to Tony Soprano, the gangster man thinks, and the reality of life he has done and, quite frankly, would never have even known how much His associates ended. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat someone to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while moving and dropping into the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while feeding peanut butter from the jar, and give that nephew tips about her upcoming wedding as they just finished an Sunday afternoon in NFL football look. Even Carmella, his wife, given a chance for a way out, finds that he really prefers life with Tony and the pros and cons that he and his other look at in his ending to life on his own. If you follow the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you did not, trust me you never saw a TV show ending like this.
