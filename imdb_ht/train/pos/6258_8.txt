They probably could skip some of the start - I'm not sure why this starts from the Asian party in Turkey. If it were because of the start of the Mediterranean, they could have come closer to the modern day of Lebanon. <br /> One camera and team found in the Bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an amazing 48-day journey. 50,000 people with 250,000 goats, camels, animals, and horses make this amazing trek that looks like a very fast moving Karun River. Used boots that keep floating by inflated skin - you can see where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I guess about a 60 degree increase. <br /> <br /> Just watch what was incredible, but there was more to come. To find pastures, they also crossed a mountain high on 4 feet in snow, if not more. They were able to climb this hill very amazing in and in itself, but they (and all the animals) climb up this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> A disadvantage of one this documentary was some of the inter-titles and poor attempts of humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the era of silence, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces, but conquer. This is just an incredible document in a small group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
