Post-feminist illustrations of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! <br /> This under ants of a movie tells the story of Flavia, a fifth female girl at Noble birth folded up in a convent after defining her father, and indeed in medieval Christian society does not look a fallen Islamic fall as a human rather than demonic figure .Can not accept the patriarchal rule of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop came flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia began explicitly questioning the society in which he finds himself and, when he burning against a whole system of submissiveness, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to himself but to all who are around him. <br /> <br /> In fact, as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from true. This is a film filing the consequences of violence, patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and corruption in the human spirit. <br /> I described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and at the end of the triumphs of the Flavia must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men. Even the great end of the flavia is the threat of men (the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror. <br /> <br /> As the very violence denies: this is an illustration of the effects of violence and Horrors in a mad driving world do not overlook religiouss.While leaving the violence would have limited film impact, there would have been cheapened the movie and allowed it to be assimilated in the Patriarchal speech it is exposed. In addition it is a realistic portrait in the medieval society. <br /> <br /> The most filmed, brilliant act (notably by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), which has a wonderful note by Piovani and always difficult after all these years Flavia is a classic of the European Cinema.
