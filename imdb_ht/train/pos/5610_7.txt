Roman Polanski masters direct this sort of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can not imagine that one honest films can not be recognized by the fine director at Le Locataire, but both sides of the dip may not be well-satisfied for most people I included. <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his character (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself at Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-insurance soon to turn steadily into psychological concerns eventually flowers in an irreversible physical discomfort. The sharing approach for the characters and audiences is really different from the fear and tension of horror movies since there's no supernatural furniture component here. While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski sadistic tortured us, and, if at last his opus humorous dark is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to corners in our place. <br /> <br /> Stop, horror, all this is a matter of playing and hearing the audience (alternately jumping and filling them), not literally and nervous. In Baby Rosemary's book I am a major achievement because she has absolute paranoia and plain rationality in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a single character. What's more if the fantasy elements are all in mind the hero's situation is more comfortable since our viewers, they have to judge it, reject it while we have been attracted to the "painting" to lure " ) in being to him.
