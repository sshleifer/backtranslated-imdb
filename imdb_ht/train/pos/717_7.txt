great fan of Ramones. I do like the ramons, and I suppose if you hate them, then besides being a surprise supporter of Bush, you might not like this classic. <br /> it's incredibly better than the john hughes teen movie center and like this 80's pack. Infinitely better than the American pie that is our current disorder. There are other major high school film schools: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Groups of '84, Three O'Clock Highs, and Cheesy again attracting (does not seem possible) to the River Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with it. <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> 10/10
