I love this movie, but the music of all ancient gatherings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all of the music played in dance ets are from the 1950s and many years Early 1960. <br /> <br /> Having just gone to my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the latest music must be played at a meeting or dance in the old high school people is music music. <br /> I understand difficulty finding 1970 related music - we all know what a waste of time it was musically. But it was not completely robbed, and the producers of the film should take more care. I found the very dancer scenes of otherwise jarring to the unwanted suspicion of the rest of the movie. <br /> This was a bad director and / or producer decision.
