This film completely runs around the original Dolemite. It has everything that makes a big movie .. except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know that! LOL) I admit that I killed my first movie tape video and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has its very enticing line of pitiful! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the theme of singing backwards and forwards! I like Jimmy Lynch's character of death, and he should have the best actor Support for Blaxploitation support, but the Oscars have NOT been ready for this! This is a random film that includes croaking cops, breasts, chases, bad correction, and of course martial arts. (Then it's 70 years and I can tell everyone knew some kind of martial art). I think this film should be restored and show a night in the midst of a local theater marathon!
