I was just watching this because it starred Josie Lawrence, whom I knew <br /> <br /> from Line Line is it Anyway?, The British Infantry Farrer <br /> comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heated magic magic. It is uplifting, touching, and romantic <br /> without being steamed or sensitive. Characters are <br /> all real people, with real foibles, fears and needs. Look at it!
