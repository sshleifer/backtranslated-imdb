Faulty Grim is a true example of what I call a file puzzle complete. It has all the pieces of act, direction, scenario, and entertainment value. They all fit together and when they create a masterpiece, Grim Fail. This movie follows one mate Fault Grim trying to raise his son does not grow up to be his father who runs away from the law and he misses. Soon the CIA contacted Fay's desperate pursuit to find 8 newspapers in her husband Henry. These newspapers were filled with confessions of his past by the CIA and his involvement with the countries and the governments. Fay was sent to find these newspapers, in return to free his brother in prison, and sent on a chat with mice across Europe to recover these newspapers and learn from secret hidden her husband he never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was already an actress I liked after I watched her in the Ohio OH and Best of Show. He has been blessed with these two comedy roles, but Grim Grim has been a far cry from the other two movies. Posey has made me believe what happened on the screen, I felt it for me, I'm rooting for it, and I wanted to know more. It's your tram while it's on screen and when it's off you can not stop thinking about what's going on it. <br /> I have not seen any other previous work by author / director Hal Hartley but I believe I'll look at some of her earlier films if they are half as good as Grim Fail. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie choice when you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD I would highly encourage you to choose Grim Fail. If you have any common sense on how a movie should you will enjoy this movie very much.
