One of the best film actors I have ever seen. There is not much of the plot, but the act-incredible. You see the characters have changed all the time so subtle, undr the influence of renting the villa in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a fascinating spell on you, as much as the villa does on all the women. Surely "Enchanted".
