Agree. This movie is a pure fun. It has been the ever so violent movie mixed with a suspension and a lot of black comedies. The dentist really starts to liberate his ideas and it's enjoyable to watch him do that. This movie is for some people, though. Either you will completely love it or you'll totally hate it. A good movie for rent and look when you do nothing else to do. Also Recommended: Psycho III
