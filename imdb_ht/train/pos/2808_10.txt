This movie is not morbid, it is depressing. It's sad, because AIDS in the early 90s is so sad. But his real message is one of love and perseverance. Mark and Tom were in a lasting relationship, love. Attachment to one another is obviously immediate, and as the raids of AIDS become scandalous and become focal points in their lives, you see the strength and commitment that is truly heartwarming. <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as an advisor to an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film talked to me as there was no other AIDS film in his day could be, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the many experiences that I've seen on a daily basis in real life. I knew from eye experience that she liked to watch AIDS eating away in vibrant, young, healthy people; Seeing it came to Mark and Tom in the movie was much like watching my real life my dear friend. It touches me in a way that, even all the years later, always affect me.
