There have been a lot of things going against this movie for me before I watch it. <br /> First, I was a typical high school high school, in a Shakespeare class I did not really even love, much less understood the half! Shakespeare should be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without pouring my focus into playing almost his encryption ... encrypted and very difficult to understand language .... and then I still would not get most of it. <br /> <second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well let me tell you something. This movie was so mastery, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language as it was done. Now the script was followed by the letter of this movie, even the script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare's class. And here I was thinking of opening and understanding it. I suffered myself while watching the movie almost! But look and see ... when feast, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So, this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is a true master, who wrote great stories. When I saw him on the big screen, especially in the high budget image photo shoot (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and acting amazingly by Brannagh and casting, somehow .... I understand what was going on . What was being said. The language is awesome and passionate. It allows for more raw emotions ... when words can not describe something, perhaps the word Shakespeare can. <br /> I always keep that day that points in the North Star (anime, English dub) is the greatest movie ever made. No movie that gives more absolute entertainment. But for a movie to come close to dethroning points out of this position (which Hamlet did - it became closed) is really amazing ... awful inspiration. It's not a movie. It was an event. <br /> Even more amazing, she made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Power is the word. One of the rare, TRULY powerful cinemas is out there. <br /> This gets 2 stars trillion stars from infinity stars. Yes yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all your kids out in a Shakespeare class ... forget it. You are wasting your time. You have to see the plays performed. Only then will justice be done.
