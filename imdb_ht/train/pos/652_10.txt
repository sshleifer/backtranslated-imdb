This movie is so complex that it can provide any description and still roll with it. Do you have an insecure, troubled and captivating character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is blocked between two (not, three) women. We listen to the social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies of an endemic monologue, we see him working his magic of the three women he likes. this could be the quote for a movie movie, full of rigid, cold, refreshing reviews. Again director Jean Eustache managed to keep it cool, ironic and witty. Being a long film, one can not but burst into laugh when, after 2 hours of polite talk, Jean-Pierre Léaud all a sudden shout on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie . This type of situation is purely cinematographic and can not be completely restored to a Next. neither can anyone restore the tragic monologue and great breath of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours and each minute value.
