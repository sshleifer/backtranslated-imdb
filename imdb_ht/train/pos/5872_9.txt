Who votes in these assessments? "Jacknife" is a wonderful action, brilliantly observing pieces of work, and top actors, especially Ed Harris and Peerless Robert DeNiro (please not mention Marlon Brando the same breath of the man-see "taxi driver" for confirmation at this point). Is it a movie 'mundane' because it does not have action without / sensing / nudity in it. This film is about complexity of characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with her and her emotional explosion towards the end is heartbreaking. The party where he asked a young man in a bar to take off his army dress is a beautiful fashion statement and movies exploiting tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart attire military attire. While we are on the topic, "casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, begins the greatest film actor of all time, with the film psychotic gangster movie ever, only warrants just above average ? Come !!!!!
