I run across this movie in the local video store during their annual sidewalks. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale, I came across this movie. I returned to the movie and knew it was God's work to buy this movie. You see, I have a sibling group of three Foster (and soon to be adopted) children living with my family. Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starting in the movie. The film helped them better understand the circumstances. For the first time, too, the oldest in the sibling group (7 year old / girl) decided to open up to me a little over his past and the trauma he had experienced. He fought the problem with confidence. This is also the first time I saw her cry. After watching the movie, I asked him what he meant for a child to adopt. He replied, "This means to be happy." A must see for families who encourage children and consider adoption. It certainly opens the lines of communication with us.
