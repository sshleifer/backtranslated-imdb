This movie has it all. Watch the gags, subtle jokes, play on words and verses. It is about a group of rags tag of boys from different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look this more than once, you will find it citing it like Animal House (and yes I like Animal House too). I put in the top 15 feline movies. The big one in a military boy academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause problems (in this movie it is right). It is sadistic, uncaring, cruel and has to go down. The boy group who does not get together at first, end up collecting together to survive and get rid of the Major and a wacky plan only Mad Magazine could in writing. A must see - you'll love it!
