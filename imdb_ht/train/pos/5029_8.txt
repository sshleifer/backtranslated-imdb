I went to this movie maybe somewhat jaded by the hack-and-cut movie rampant on the screen these days. Boy, I was amazed. This little treasure was enjoyable rhythm with a dull, dark atmosphere. More surprising yet the very limited amount of blood has actually been shown. Like best movies, this one leaves something in the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a superb job of directing. The scene shot inside the car as they did well, and, after watching the "Anatomy of a Scene" episode of the end of the tape video, it was good to see that some of these subtle things, but the wonderful thing I noticed was intentional and not just an "Oh, that looks good, keep it" kind of direction. This is a moody movie, full of grimace. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the most disturbing scenes. The act is exceptional (Well, I've always been a fan of Booth Power), and never goes over the head. On the contrary, it is very submissive that works very well for this type of film. If there is any area where this film is missing, it is in the end, which seems just a bit too perfect, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. What is the message? It's something that everyone decides for themselves. In general, on the scale 1-10, this film scored an 8th of those who love the genre of southern Gothic area (ie: "Body heat" or "midnight in the garden of good and evil") , and about 5 for those who did not.
