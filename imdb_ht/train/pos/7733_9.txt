Foley's strong Noir in this saturated and intense film is seemingly "perfectly" fit together. Injections by shot, modified by modifying, the movie unfolds itself around a distant boxer discovering its own purpose (or lack thereof). The other comments around may indicate a lack of interest, but I personally think this is a superbly put together Cinematic piece!
