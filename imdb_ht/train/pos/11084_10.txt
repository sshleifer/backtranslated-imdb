<br /> I saw the Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I urge my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for it on video over five years ago, finally finding a copy on an auction site online, but I would like to see it either pick up by a new distributor and rereleased (I understand the original video run was small) , or maybe purchased at Family Channels, Disney, etc. and show regularly. It's a fascinating movie that draws you to the story of the life struggle in a family of foxes in northern Japan, recounted by a wise old tree. Soundtrack's excellent movie congratulations. It would be a good seller today, better than many of the cheap offerings in today's films.
