Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice's popular folk novel is not without part of conflict. When first released members of the black community criticized her treatment of black men, while others questioned why a white man directed this movie to black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing in rural America after the turn of the century. He had two children by his abusive father from his arms at birth. Only her is her miserable life from her sister. Celie (playing in later years by Nouvocom Whoopie Goldberg) married on an abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is outraged by the sister and so he is quickly removed from Celia's life. The story is often heartbreaking as Celie keeps up hope she can one day meet with her sister and her children. Throughout her life, she meets a variety of characters, including Sophia, a tough guy like nails at his stepmother, and Shug, a loud and lively singer singer, who teaches it something or about love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> I dare you watch this movie and have not moved it! The Purple movie manages to capture the essence of this is a complicated story. While it tends to minimize the lesbian aspects as well as the African history, both of which have been so alive in the book, the movie remains true to its terms, allowing the voice of Alice Walker the shine. <BR> I could not start responding to the conflict surrounding this movie. Sure it says, however, this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again, and has left an indelible mark on me. <br />
