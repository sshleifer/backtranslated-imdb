Culture film from 1979 in which students at Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Even so is a horror of music and blame the music flavors of their students for their transgressions. Leading the charge against it is fun-like Riff Randell (PJ Sol), # 1 Ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock band to record his songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an impossible movie resistant. First and foremost, the band is incredible, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground in addition to the variety of non-stop in Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Rocker Punk", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. And the throw really gives it all, and Sol an ideal choice for the RIFF role; it is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious as Tom and Kate, Woronov are well-disposed of as Togar's Snooty and Deden, Clint Howard has one of his best parts ever as Bathroom-Owners Eaglebauer Entrepreneur, and New World Rgar such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (particularly entertaining as the music teacher Mr. McGree) and Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it's a treat to see the Ramones play themselves. The movie has genuine spirit. The high energy level, with co-authored authors and director Allan Arkush brings a great deal of flair to the procedures. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper air gag is a superb example of this. This extends right to "wipe" style of transition scenes. There are even hilarious giant mice created by remarkable future makeup effects Rob Bottin, in one of his earliest gigs. <br /> <br /> On as good as a defiant authority, defending-one-right-to-party movie can be found. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is, of course, a wonderful movie movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
