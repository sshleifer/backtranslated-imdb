This movie is just a lot of fun. I've seen it a couple of times, but it still has a funny thing I remember. "The duckies and bunny" car scene is one of my favorites, and I still quote Morone's version in some words! <br /> There are many jokes running, that's amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anyhow!
