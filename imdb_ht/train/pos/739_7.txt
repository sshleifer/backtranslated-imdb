I've been a fan of Jodie Foster ever since we were both kids, from his Disney year. I loved antique tomboy in films like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Cow" was such a great departure at all. Where other young actors of that era returned to sexuality Disguised as comedian ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie went for a depressive and tragic story of dragged youth to break them by the powerful tackling attraction and addiction. <br /> <br /> This is not Disney. This was not Porky. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young life. Unfortunately it is a story that always plays out on a daily basis throughout the country, this could be replayed movie (with a current band) and still totally important. <br /> It's not the best movie ever to do, it's tired of some parts, not all performances are particularly exceptional. But Jodie Foster continues to show her chop as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young at taxi driver). <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
