This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walking on Water, has a minor role in this film too. <br /> But the real stars are young Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestine who joins them and over - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe Sweid). There's sort of a Friend / Sex in the City things go on (especially gay), and they all just want the war in the end so they can go on with their lives in peace. rub. No matter how many posters you set up or how many waves of peace you have, the war will not end. Many have tried during the years carrying the two sides on the table, but they just want to keep it away for whatever reason. There are many on Israeli side, both here and here in the US, who just want it all and will not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side that apparently would come from a work that should be peaceful ever to come. It is of interest no one at the end of this war, and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging movie. It will not go away. You know something tragic that will happen and, of course, it does. And the feelings on both sides are strong, and revenge as the motive, tragedy still happens, and that's what this is an adult version of Friends / City Sex. There is no superficiality. It is real life, and it was a wonderful thing to see.
