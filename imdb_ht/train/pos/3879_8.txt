A typical Clausen movie, but then again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. This is really a great movie about normal people living normal lives trying to do the best of it. 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convinced. You think it's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who really is an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> <Everyone has problems with people who do not believe in finishing up being happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win life and love.
