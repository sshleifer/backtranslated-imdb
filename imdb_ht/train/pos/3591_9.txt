I never bothered to see this film in the theater although I remember listening to the on and off. I finally watch it this week with this a pleasure. For some reason, I was hoping it should not be very good so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with it and found myself completely pulling in. I read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me, how many people talk about fighting in the ring, but that was wonderful about Diana is that it is a true fighter in their lives. All he needs to do is find his place where he is and the ring help him get there. A very intelligent story and I'm surprised that this is the first time up for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did. Adrian and his coach were also quite good. <br /> This movie is a little rough around the edges, but it does not matter in the slightest. The story, wishes, and performances completely outweigh any flaws (which usually come with freelance smokers anyway). A compelling portrayal of a girl finds herself and triumph over her circumstances with a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
