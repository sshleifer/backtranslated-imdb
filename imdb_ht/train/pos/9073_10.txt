My wife and I took our son 13 years old to see this movie and were absolutely happy with the pleasure of the movie's fun. He had more appealing to boys and boys who remember their children, but even women enjoy the movie and especially refuse Hallie Kate Eisenberg, "Boys are so weird." It is refreshing to see a movie that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are truly different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do these sorts of unusual things and usually survive telling the story and scare them funny moms! We enjoyed the very movie that my son and a 11 year old friend, myself and my daughter 23 old companion went to see the movie the next day for a gentleman out. We had even more fun the second time everyone and everyone raved on it. It's clean and delightful to act by a pre-teenager casting reminiscent of the Classic Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel it will be a hiking tournament hit by unlike the "Freaks & Geeks" who did not survive its first season, but sell-out released its DVD. Watch it especially if you have a boy and you will find it stimulating conversation about fun and security! Girls will love it because of the opportunity to allow them to say, "Boys are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
