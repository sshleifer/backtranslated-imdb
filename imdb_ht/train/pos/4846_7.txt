This is a classic British comedy-thriller I've always wanted to check out, but no opportunity has appeared so far now. It is based on a popular stage game which has previously been filmed a number of times already (most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version seems to have not survived its entirety!); Noticed under review, the plot has been updated the ever-current situation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was mostly familiar with British early comedy in the films of Will Hay: giving that one feature a similar scheme of hacking legends, smuggling and enemy agents, many of that vein (It was actually scripted by Hay Registry of Edgar Marriott, Val Guest and JOC Orton); The elements of travelers blocked, then, was an equally tried-and-true formula. The star of this time around is Arthur Askey (abetted by Richard Murdoch) - none of my films have been watched before - which is as easy a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially disappointing. but one soon to warm up to it, and certainly certainly comes with a number of witty lines and entertaining bits of business at all justifying the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 movie version) has been split into here, and Murdoch acts as a friendly partner. <br /> <br /> Going one setting (the events in the movie largely take place during one night time) provide for some wonderful atmosphere; The last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually arriving in the title car itself - is especially attractive and well-organized. Also worth mentioning in the left cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotyped pair of spinsters, and a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink.
