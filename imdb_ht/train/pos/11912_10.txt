I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for her cheesy and semi-complicated script actions. A lot of people complaining about the "confusion" scheme of the first movie, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a mute as rock conspiracy and the same super-action to bring it to. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. He raised from a branch in Africa. A good portion of the movie only has dialogue in an African language without subtitles, which I loved because it made it looks a bit native (how many movies in this genre really try to do that?). It does not take long for the evil Cyborg in time to travel back in time to find it and try to kill it. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that first one was anything great). There are subplots that involve Africa's hustle, hunt treasure, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brain, so none of these things gets a very good treat. The picture is basically a draw out battle with some chases that nail down to muscle-babe vs cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just does not expect quality, or anything in the first movie.
