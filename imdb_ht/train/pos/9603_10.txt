I have only one word in this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater were crying. This movie shows the difficulties that Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The film was very well done and really made you part of the movie, I was so emotionally moved to the movie because it reminds us that we are very likely to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less save us then. And sometimes we should give them a tea and help them, at the very end. I would give them ten stars and give it to Darius when they did not ask them, and did not do it for the money they had done for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius goes to the west .
