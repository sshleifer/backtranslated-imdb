The perfect child is a story about 30-something, someone who looks "perfect" and others who are basically a vis-a-vis, often landing at the drug rehab center. After their father's death, two were gathered together after a long absence with the usual resurfacing sibling rivalry. Not until the "perfect" fee makes the revelatory revelation that he has AIDS that is irresponsible to the younger brother finally to make a move to get his life in order and take some responsibility. A good job of chronicling the "brother's comeback", though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times (beating drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the film more sensitive is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has become a bit trickier in the movies over the last 5-10 years. Also, the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two former foliage brothers is very credible and well-done. The main actors were both very competent, if not very much charisma. A solid first-featured effort from director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose own brother died in AIDS. The finish is nicely done too. <br /> <br />
