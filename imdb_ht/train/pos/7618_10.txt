Hi: <br /> I heard about losing to a co-worker who had clear distinctions in entertainment, she liked it. Well I was watching an episode or 2 in the early seasons and being bored, so I tuned it out. After a few years I stumbled upon losing; bored with the current Sci-Fi price. Wow I was amazed. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in the pace with the scripting are very good, some of the forward / back flash are so with the lamer characters, but on the whole. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael definitely are real estate, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 stage above them, Juliet has been more stylish way than Kate. Mr. Echo under-rated way and on the Charlie level if not more, too bad they both died. The black dress guy is talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. As a great, many layers of layers: looking for more. <br /> <br /> Concern
