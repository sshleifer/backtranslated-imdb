I liked this movie from the opening sequence up to the end. I found the style director / actor directly addressing me / the audience very engaging. <br /> What I found most interesting and refreshing about this movie was to ignore it - and so hard - in gender and stereotypes. The dioceses of the characters are described as force, and the absence of trial - and the acceptance of the characters in themselves and each other - allow me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, with intelligence and humor humor and love, this film has the power to open us into new possibilities, and offers hope for a world where people see and accept each other as unique and precious people. I look forward to more creative and talented creative offerings.
