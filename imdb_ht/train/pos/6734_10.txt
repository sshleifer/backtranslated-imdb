Monte Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the story and story of three surfer-wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done an amazing job to take on the role of director and should be congratulated to make such a brilliant job. The film's structure is edited brilliantly and it works perfectly with narration, interviews, animation and foot navigation. The band's music just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making Riding Giants look brighter. Personal staff include any of Greg Noll's comments, what's with his right-to-point frankness, Laird Hamilton's footage in Teahupoo, and out-of-the-film movie. But really this whole movie is one big, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It's a shame it's no more well known, but it's a gem worthy of attention. 10/10
