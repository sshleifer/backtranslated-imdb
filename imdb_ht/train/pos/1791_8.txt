This is not a profound movie; Most of the plot aspects are very predictable and "tried and true" but it was well-acting and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the movie appeals) as we look back on our lives. I did not read the book, so did not know much more than it was the story of a dying woman whose strong memories had long ago that she had not really shared with anyone. Fortunately they got a top-notch cast .... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, play the young Lila, and then Meryl shows up the end of the movie as old Adult Lila ... in addition to an amazing resemblance (duh!) the actress at least did a great job (maybe not quite up to his mother's caliber, but who?) All others in this movie were fine, although I wish there was more to Glen Lock and think the Buddy character was alittle too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more of a girl's movie than for the guys, but a good thing to see with your mom, or your daughter, and perhaps start some dialogue going. How difficult it is to know a parent as a "person"!
