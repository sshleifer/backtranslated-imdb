The fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression when people had a difficult time worldwide to get jobs or even get the food placed on the table. In Europe Hitler was on the rise, along with other nationalist whackjobs / socialists. In the United States seeds in the cartel were sown with the Federal Reserve Law and the tax revenue amendment (16) began to bring fruit for capitalist capital to connect with society to dominate their secrets. <br /> For the average guy and girl, times were difficult. Join Hollywood with at least some hopeful image? I do not think we can well call them propaganda at this point, though this particular film revolves around war-naval preparation exercises. The real problem for boys and girls then as now, how to tackle up with the right one, lead a decent life, have wonderful children, and a modicum grace and elegance. <br /> <br /> The chances were long. <br /> <br /> <br /> For full review of this movie and for other films and book reviews, please visit TheCoffeeCoaster.com site. <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
