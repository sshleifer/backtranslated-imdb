This is a great British movie. A cunning script is observed with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can make in a man over a weekend. As for every usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with what's most rated by British actor Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles and a joint hanging out of his mouth are a casting masterstroke with Gary Stretch and looks like his haze brings something strange to the atmospheric of the piece. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, I think it will get an audience outside of this, purely on the site that was a lot of people who had to do it and received T-shirt la. Also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really could be an 21st century inherited in the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weed of the Welsh gardens: it's a farmer!
