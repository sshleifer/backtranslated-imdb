I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classic musicians, are very good at his work, when you see it in a music movie, you know it will be good! I would suggest that people look at this heady heart, sad, and special movie, if they want to know more about Richard! Exceptional! Fresh!
