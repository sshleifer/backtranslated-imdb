First I was totally caught by guards by the film's initial lyricism and then I became totally enchanted with the unfolding story with rude and brilliant director. Characters have all been fully developed, not bigger than life but just as people we live in anywhere in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all completely credible human beings and foibles and nobility. Hollywood was able to learn a lot from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to go through every little detail behind each action to carry out clear and bright terms, and show the shine of the director! Thanks to Hearfelt Home Pollak and thrill wonderful to treat this superb !!
