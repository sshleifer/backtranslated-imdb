The concept of Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of slippery chimney works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny and funny comic situations, from special Stan Laurel to neck as usual. The film also has a subplot and a nutty teacher who works on a rejuvenating formula. It does not really sound like a logical mix of story line and incoherent, but both lines draw the blend perfectly to the end of the memory. It's always a bit strange, but its funny still, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> Throw in the movie support is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotyped butler and Lucien Littlefield goes succinctly on the top as the nutty teacher. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of some timed and hilarious excerpts constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to look nevertheless thanks to the ways they are all executed. It all helps to make "Working Room" to be one of the best Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
