Fluttering butterflies in the Atlantic can lead to a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the Chaos Theory, I'm not sure exactly how) each action, no matter how small or insignificant, will begin a chain reaction that can lead to great events. This small jewelry in a movie shows us a series of seemingly related characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each other's life. (The six-degree-in-separation theory can be applied as well.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this movie. The act is woven well-tuned with nuances (Audrey Tautou is glowing), the plausibel story story, the humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theater theater in agreement.
