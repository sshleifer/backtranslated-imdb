I do not want to pass in time here rambling on the plot- you saw the trailer, and if you do not have its online. I do not recommend seeing it though - it was wrong to fabricate and not pack any of the laughter or magic of the movie. So those who avoid this movie due to its dreadful trailer should give this one a chance. It's really funny. I was hauled by the cleverness and originality of this movie. The first 40 minutes made me to the floor of hysteria- only my problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad film Austin Power in the final 20. That's however one of the few films where the camp ends did not make me love the rest of the movie (which is usually the case). Everyone has a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and some really great moments at all. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - only to catch all the details that I was laughing about during the first look!
