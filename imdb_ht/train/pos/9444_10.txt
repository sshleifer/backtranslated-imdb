*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with memorable moments (like the quote above, immortalized by Primus), the Deliverance tells four four guys stories that take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are usually no special effects, the environment is very realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made beautiful. The boys in the city seem to be boys in the city, and even Louis's tough guy, described and accurately by Burt Reynolds, is clearly in the pity of the wild in this journey. This is a perfect example of a ki-si movie. What if a few friends went rafting in an area in the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended desperately trying to avoid being tried and sentenced to murder by being forced to save their own their lives? > <br /> There is clearly a very strong element in the film that deals with society structure and class and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four men arrive in the early woods of the movie, they clearly do not know how to communicate with the people who live, and talk to them as if they are not sure if they will understand or be able to communicate. This most commonly memorized communication block in the scene of harmful banjoes, in which they try to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive their cars downriver. While Drew and obviously embraced and probably mentally impaired the boy on the porch are dueling with the guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has some difficulty buying gas, and Bobby makes a comment on genetic weakness and how minor it all is. When the boy turned away from Drew, who offered to shake his hand after comfortable jam session, Bobby said to the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are well assured how they react. /> This is the kind of thing that we see in the salvation that lies in the tension that is to follow. This big scene where a lot of fun has been (including the scene of 'dancing riding' dance until Brother, where are you?) Ended up with all those idiotic ones that make each other. These are apples and oranges, and they live in completely different rules of life. The people of Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet in the hills have grown apart from modern societies and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which does not include you will not kill. Confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends put out on the river, hoping for the weird end to the adventure to begin. <br /> <br /> (Deflector) When they briefly separate each other with Ed and Bobby running in the rivers on the river that quickly turns unpleasant, the uncertainty on the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - come to play to create the most tense during the scene. I think a good sign of a kind thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the attacks and current crimes, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remains some of the most memorable part of the movie. There is no free violence here, it's all there for an obvious goal and has achieved a powerful flash flood. <br /> <br /> The move is about violent clashes of two very different types of people, and that can happen when they inadvertently find themselves in war with each other. The journey goes down to the rear after the attack, which takes up the majority of the movie, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with lots of things that you become numb. It is amazingly effective when we find that Ed can very well killed the man wrong on the cliff, and the tension of the film does not even leave up when the three members survive in the team reaching the bottom of the river , because they delivered a doubtful explanation of the police about what happened on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law disappeared. <br /> This is a very disturbing movie, which is a testament to its success, because it is very clear that a movie like this means shaking people up a little. Hillbillies are the most realistic version of the sub-human rednecks seen in movies, but fairly similar to Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, which may be ever compared to a timeless movie like Deliverance. When we follow these four decisive weeks in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the guys well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like us, as people in the audience, they are really a fifth member of the team. It is not often that a movie is able to come in any way.
