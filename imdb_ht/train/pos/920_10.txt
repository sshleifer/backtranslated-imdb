This cute animated short feature of funny icons - Betty Boop and Henry. Henry is the bald, little portly boy from the comic who never speaks. <br /> <br /> Well here he's talking! She wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when she left in the store - some hilarious sketch scams. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets into a fight with birds and a monkey, but everything works out to the end.
