It took me a while to watch this version as unfortunately I do not seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always borderline with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not naturally British have put on the accent, and my well does not seem natural. It seems to put on it. Sorry but not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job. I could not warm to any of the characters, but this version is more hearty and more kind of people I imagine Emma to be. It is definitely the version I'll be back from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not the best looking, but it is convincing. I also love Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed it into the movie version, but it is best described in this version. Come to think of it, (besides Mr Knightley) all the best characters played, and a lot less on the head. Unfortunately, both came out around the same time and the Paltrow version had more advertisements. Mercy ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this one.
