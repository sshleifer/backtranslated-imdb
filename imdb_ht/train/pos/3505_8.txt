I have no idea how IMDb types are reviewed but I know that, as happens often on Amazon.com, there is a hit number of highly negative reviews for this movie that repeats the same, a bit dark talk , almost rvatatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> As for this movie: it's fine. It's a funny, beautiful and very simple movie. <br /> It was about a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited the family of South Bronx. But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitation of these children. Is the grandmother a rare character? Yes. Does the dialogue and conspiracy recognize this? Yes, fortunately, they do. Do other movies put in the READ and present Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does this movie make a crime? Like some of my (my eyes, astroturf) comments would suggest? Diman. Leave a thousand flowers of flower bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or High Degrassi. Scoff in the comparison, but _we've never been that that_ and I touched, at the core, not humility to this film of purpose and sensitive mind. <br /> <br /> That said, I would like to know the backstory behind all this obstacle! :-D
