I have no idea how to describe this movie, and also want to give others the same opportunity I've had - to see it with no previous knowledge of what you can expect. I enjoyed it incredibly, but it can also tell me barely understanding what is happening, in fact, there was nothing to be understood in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Maddie Maddin movie should be particularly enjoying this, and any fan of EIGHTBALL in comic books will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder (it has come as close as any movie I've seen in the tone and mood of the Clowes creates so effectively.) A small note just notes warning anyone to let go - this movie, if rated, NC-17 would be safe. Fans of full-front men's nudity, however ... hmm, well ... yes. This is wild wild thing.
