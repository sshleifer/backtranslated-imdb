Paulie was beautiful, cool, enjoyable and well-fitted. I went to this film hoping to see a typical "family" movie, one that at the time would get me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My Mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly captivated by the movie smile. It's rare that you get a family movie that is good and can invent "good". Most of them do cheaply, write and produce peppers to attract family members, who will then drag the unfortunate elders into a 65-minute numbing mind in gage sight and use cemetery. <br /> Oh yes, Paulie had a draw. He tells the story of a girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie Jesuit, which unbelievably could speak and often hold conversations with her. Dorky European grandmother found this incredible, and thought Paulie must be damaging her 4 year old mental health, and quickly torn apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as she tries to meet with her beloved master, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie could really (smart) talk and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot held thick and fun at all, keep me attracted. Paulie is the best family movie I found with all the joy enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. No sleep. I promise.
