The beautiful Danish artist Sonja Richter steals this movie from under the noses of everyone, no small feat to consider the terrific performances surrounding her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, an out-of-work, independent-minded, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps committed suicide) actress who has done a desperate job looking after a wheelchair, humorous, The father's father, Walentin (the great Danish actor frits Helmuth, died in 77 shortly thereafter). Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - she met the gifted Anna, whose capricious and malignant way brings the poor old Satan stole back from an independent death sentence. /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a strong movie about the difficulty of a son of ponderous businessman (Jorgen, played by Clausen) loving a father who never accepted him. These films are toward the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about Ethanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how one man, Anna in irresistible, can change the course of a human life. Very recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth the cost of admission.
