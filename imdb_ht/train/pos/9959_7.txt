Well, if you are open-minded enough to have loved Barber Shop, then you'll love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If you yourself as close-minded as Fort Knox, then you'll be given the current score that it has: 2.5. <br /> This is a movie for anybody to prepare to watch movies from outside of their own racial strip. It is engaging, it's true in life, in two or three occasions you lose the connection between the scenes, but many times, especially towards the end, you find yourself having a water or two in your eyes and this too simply because it often mirrors what life can be. <br /> I love it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional American movie.
