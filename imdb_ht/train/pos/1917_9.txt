This was a funny comedy comedy and a great cast. Jan Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly cast like their parents, and the kids were too big. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, who was sort of a tone-down version of Kelly Bundy from getting married to the kids. Writing and performance were both first-rate. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and put a cap on things. They had to fight to show the show and bring in more cast members, and it was obviously a comfortable situation, but they did handle it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could last longer that Ritter had left. <br /> I especially liked it when being brought to Ed O'Neill in a guest room. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
