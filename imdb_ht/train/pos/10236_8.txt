Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who loves Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main movie protagonist is most definitely the batter sound of the two strange ancestors. As for the other character assets are familiar transformations of stereotypes similar to action. Where this film is original is in the mix of the traditional Hong Kong film style and the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately this was not true of the films he made in Hollywood.
