Nobody really understands the logic behind the number of zombie Italian flicks, but ?? honestly ?? why would we bother? Each single film in the series "Zombi" delivers great fun, nasty gore and free kicks and "Zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite the difficulty productions that have also occurred shooting. This film began as an exciting project Lucio Fulci, which has devised more of his "Zombi 2" success, but has ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product that has more flaws and stolen ideas in previous films . The movie is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every spirit of George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and the "Crazies" is versa repeat here and performance to act is really miserable and painful look. But all this did not upset me for a moment because sublime over-the-top Gore offset for everything! On a secret army base in Phillipines, scientists have fished virus warlike bacteria "one death" and prepare it for transportation. After an attempt to steal the virus, the body is infected by a wounded terrorist wounded by the ash zombies contaminating the entire population in a nearby tourist town. The last group of survivors has to fight zombie active hunter and strong people as well as the overall white soldier who has received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Surely evil ... but incredibly amusing and fast-paced sequence of actions and several very creative zombie-madness situations. The undead birds were originally, for example, and the whole birth sequence of the deserted hospital was very cool as well. The infamous scene jumps off by almost as horrible as it's made up to be and is partly perfect in this cheesy and very cute Italian Zombie Cops. Recommended for the fans; Do not mind the negative reviews.
