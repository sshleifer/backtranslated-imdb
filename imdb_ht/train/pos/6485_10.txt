The world of war is one of the best documentaries on world war 2. <br /> <br /> 24 episodes cover the war and it was like in the countries involved. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power, and how he could build one of the strongest armies in the world. They are also fukus on military action taken during the war, and the burn. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. All of you must watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
