While listening to an audio book, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear her voice and bring back my deception that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep their good shows over long enough to take an audience that can be connected to the show. What a shame, and shame on re network for not giving this show a full season chance. This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast. The network gave "Male to Trees" a second witch chance also is a great show, but they took off "invasion" off and that was something totally different to look, not even the old-old themes adult. Why can not networks get it right.
