I saw this first movie when it was revealed on the Trio Channel now defining a few years ago, and recently watch it again - meaningless ads - on Sundance. I was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaged on second look. Yes, some of the distant segments from the perfect - Historical sur√®ksi Amos Gitai mean out as a sore throat - but taking together, 11 09 01 is a total success. The best of shows: the amazing Shohei Imamura's final, contemporary criticism like Mick's All-Grey witted somehow interpreted as an attack on the 'terrorists' but now stands out as a mastery of anti-war struggle; The opening of Samira Makhmalbaf that manages deep mixing for victims of 9/11 and a specific concern for Afghan children; and Idizas Ouedraogo's entertainment crisis for Osama Bin Laden - an almost as successful and successful hunting as a one for the real Osama. The Youssef Chahine Segment is a noble if failed experience that at least has the courage to recall the hearing that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are fundamentally creating American foreign policy with the CIA, and even though Sean Penn's character looks out of place, it's Still a piece effectively excel in film-making. All in all, look essential, with a darling eye better than the reactionary World Reactionist Oliver Stone.
