In this film Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Dan, Floyd, Animal, Janice, and Zoot are college graduates who decide to bring music success, Manhattan Melodies, Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet with the Muppets. After being declined by too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decided to move on their own. However, Kermit still believes he can find his show on Broadway, but after he finally makes and let everyone know that he's been selling the show, Kermit finds amnesia and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter as a movie cinema Usher, with a scene where Rizzo and other rats are cooked in the morning. <br /> <br /> More than I'm that more characters have not been included. Sure, many of them appear in the wedding, but there should be some important role for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Romantic, and mouths should be part of the electric destruction of this movie as it was in the last Muppet season with the Great Muppet Kip, and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo would have been with him as well (after all, Rizzo the rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a large part of this film, and he was not very well known at the time).
