In BARBARIAN AND GEISHA John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States responsible for truly open Japan international relations in the late 1850. Prior to him, Commodore Perry basically pushed into Japan with rider and forced a treat on the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who just arrived a bit later, worked in detail and helped ensure compliance - as much of the Japanese felt no particular bias honored the first treaty. All this is true and is shown in the movie. According to some other sources I found, romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly fiction and romance that is much of the focus of this movie (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction was the first time I saw this film was one of surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat? When she was diplomatic in most films, she said thank you and thank you as she pummels people !!!! So, seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed pretty odd indeed. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 that would be most unusual for this role. By the way, I saw the picture of Harris and Wayne practically there is no similarity to it all. However, despite the story taking a lot of freedom and truth and casting strange, the movie is still very watchful. The color culture is beautiful, the movie shows some beautiful scenes of Japanese customs and culture and the act is not bad. All in all, a likable and montable movie although it's odd to drop. <br /> <br /> PS - It's the Trivia for this movie. You get a bit more about the real-life characters as well as a battle supposed between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently hit him out !! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident I tend to believe. And, it's also a great example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
