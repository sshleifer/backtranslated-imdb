This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone who owns the local video store. Or, even better, you could buy it because the chances you'll watch this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. But after watching it again yesterday I found it to be amazing. <br /> A good mix of comedy (although not as great as "Mr Magoo" - in one of my favorites) and action. That's worth 10/10 and I hope they'll make an end soon (fingers crossed over). If you do babysitting or have to look after teen for nothing then I would recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :).
