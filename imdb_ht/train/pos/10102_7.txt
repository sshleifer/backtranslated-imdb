I must start saying it was a long time since I saw it but saw it 5 or more times; a pretty little wonder that was clearly inspired by the music / comedy bands of new stars or touches with music groups of importance. Home Kyser's home mystery would be a good example. <br /> Having Spike Jones Unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are part of the action, doing a fine job of support. Hugh O'Brien plays the figure, Buddy Hackett party has the rumor that he has offered to Lou Costello and thus, Abbott and Costello replace their drive. Do not know if that was true. <br /> all in all, a beautiful movie, but important to have many Spike Jones and his band on film for history. Wish he was released, as I have not seen or heard of him now in two decades. Hope it does not lose
