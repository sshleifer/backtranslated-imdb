It was fabulous! Photography, editing, movies, music combines to transport us around a dangerous tourist destination. It was fun to "slumming," without going through the danger. We were there! Sequence and flashback sequence sequences were cool. He talked to me. Keeping the job right! Another of this genre is City of God. Also - do not laugh! - The comedy, desperately seeking Susan. Nice kind of ensemble, with great performance by all. Sorry, I think that day training is adapted to genre as well, and fantastic performance by a casting ensemble. I had to change the channel on some of the fearless sequences, but all-in-all, a great movie!
