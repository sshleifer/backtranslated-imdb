This is a small little crime crime pack that packs a lot of its 65-minute time running. It has all the right ingredients - a mystery bail, a copious middle-aged bunch of Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and rookie Sidekick Tobin (John Miles), a darker killer on loose interest and even love for the Tobin in the shape of a Woman botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) helps resolve the crime. There is also a fabulous shoot-out final that takes place in a cutting tool lash. <br /> <br /> Look out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt. Corrigan refers to the woman dead as 'Tatooed Tilly' BEFORE the Coroner reveals that she had a mark (hush?). Also when Tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown will be in the wrong direction at one point - not surprising he did not catch him!
