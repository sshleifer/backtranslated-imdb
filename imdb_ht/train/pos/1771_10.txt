If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian ski runs (?) And a chase head chase that caused the death of Billys ancestors saved. filmed aside at various European round destinations and appeared polished and incredibly well-made with some episodes crossed into the reigns of noir movie and thriller thriller. And the main was often eclipse by the slices of life that Billy went on during her years of work to find her mother and secret ancestor. A class acts but underrated and forgotten.
