The film version of the hugely influential and influential Alice Walker 1983 novel (written largely as the letter from the central character to Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so .. In the role of the victim and wake Celie, Whoopi Goldberg has provided optimal screen performance by miles. Not far behind was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fire woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast out the Walker characters were presented so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, the abusive Celie's husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a change of mind for the good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Hook; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the wife of the preaching; and Carl Anderson's much-missed (otherwise better known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as Samuel preacher. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful rhythm and writing sensitivity, the 'purple' makes justice to its sources while opening the story involving viewers in a feature-length drama.
