The thought of Sarah Silverman has his own show worried me first. The films he appeared in were not very funny and humor it's a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see her true bright colors in this Central Gem comedy. I can possibly put it on par with love of Amy Sedaris in stranger and candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> A fall in this show is its tossing cast. Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately means not to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is very sub-par in comparison. <br /> I'm happy, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show unique meaning and crazy it to yourself and humor.
