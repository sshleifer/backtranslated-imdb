<br /> If you're at all interested in pirates, movie cinema, New Orleans / 19th century early American history, or Yul Brynner, see this movie for yourself and make yourself self about it. You should not put in a variety of substandard reviews. My reaction was that it is fun, well-acting (for the most part), there are some very witty dialogues, and that it does an excellent job of displaying the charm, appeal and passion of legendary Jean Lafitte's private. While not all the events in the movie are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel the movie is accurate in its treatment of Role Lafitte played in New Orleans history ', and love-loving relationships between citizens "respectable" in New Orleans and this villain was one of their favorite boys in the city. Do not worry about what the movie does not do, but look it for what it does, for example, for its study at one of New Orleans, and America, the most intriguing historical figures.
