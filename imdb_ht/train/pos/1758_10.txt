I was really surprised by this movie. Going to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd see, I thought it was going to be a dude Where's my car type of crap crap. I was waiting for bad sex jokes and farting with a pathetic lead character that will get put in the end because it's just how movies work. Instead I had a smart movie, amazingly original about a decent, average guy who had never had sex. <br /> Yes, the movie is full of jokes and jokes and vulgarity and occasional hey-look-a-new!, but it does much to the spirit of evil Santa rather than boy Sorority. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, lovable friends who just trying to hang up a brother and live their lives. <br /> I went to think this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's nice on the head (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old girl!), But it's pretty smartly done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you're really crawling for this guy to get laid, hard to say about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
