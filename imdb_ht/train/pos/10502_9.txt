one of the worst mario I've ever played. The levels are creative, have fluid control, and good graphics for its time. There's also a crowd of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrated, and if you leave out some of the difficult and still levels, need to get more accomplished in fighting a boss, it can be annoying. Another complaint is the angle of the camera; Even if it works fairly well in the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if you have a great time mario fan; that's for you. even if you're not a big fan of him, I would always recommend this one. It's a great game, and finding that you need to be able to take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short bursts of time. it will certainly keep your interest; it sure keeps me up!
