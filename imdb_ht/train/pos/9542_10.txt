Do not be fooled by the funny title, this is one sweet ride! A true successor to the Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the gor on thick until credit roll. It seems that the aliens are taking on the human body and modifies them to war-machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the entertainment of the species. The winner of the fight to feed the loser alive. That's especially her for scheme, but that cares when the gor is this good? I have no idea how many buckets of mold are used, but it's disgusting to see. There are interesting and effective uses to stop movement when shopping is taking place, and they love care about animals and make-up effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but that actually does not divert from the overall quality a bit, at least for me. This was really a fun and stomach-turn movie that deserved great praise, and it really touched its place in the fireplace of Classics Kilt. Find it and look, you will not be disappointed!
