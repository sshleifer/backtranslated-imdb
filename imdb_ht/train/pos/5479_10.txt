<br /> <br /> Arriving at the boxcar in New York City, the young woman and the BABY FACE begin to methodically move her way through the top floors of a big bank. Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as an emotional heroine of this influential pre-codable drama. Without a little of despair or regret, he frankly manipulates the removal or destruction people are unlucky enough to find themselves in his way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has every opportunity here to show her adequate talent. <br /> <br /> Very late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as fellow in one possible case can handle Stanwyck; His sophisticated style of act makes a beautiful counterpart in his mirror attitude. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook & Henry Kolker show a succession of unfortunate victims. John Wayne looks for just a few seconds of scan as an unsuccessful thirst for Stanwyck's affection. This should be the only time that these two performers appear together on screen. <br /> <br /> Mavens movie should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled. > <br /> The music heard on the soundtrack of the movie, perfectly punctuated by the draw, is 'Baby Face' (1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY is a prime example of pre-Code Abomination. In his franchises and unapologetic to deal with sex, it is precisely the kind of movie that the implementation of the Code of Production in 1934 meant to be eliminated.
