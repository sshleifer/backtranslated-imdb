OK here is how I do this. I movie movies about 10 elements. Each element will naturally begin with 5 points. It can then lose or get 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Attention: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Stop - I give this 10 points. It has a perfect balance in all five aspects. The action was fun and exited. The romance was not late, but it is still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long during the film and was captivated by the fantastic drama, and fixed suspension. <br /> <br /> Draw - I give this element 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been said. I found myself, sitting in the theater, back to my childhood, and at the moment I still believe in unicorns, cruel witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this element 8 points. While the film captured the story very well into the majority of the angles, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what happened just in camera. <br /> FX - I give this element 10 points. I love being used by C.G.I. little. The epic scene was credible. The magic powers were very realistic. All in all less is more, and this has it all! Put - I give this piece 10 points. No name and seasoned actors, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was beautiful villain, Charlie Cox did Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave the stars stars, and I never look to Robert De Niro the same thing again. <br /> <br /> Interesting - I give this 10 points. Even the Newbie Actors played the scrolls of perfection. Again, I will never look with Robert De Niro the same thing again. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I give this element 9 points. This felt a little running and I think if the movie was a bit longer they could make the characters a little better. Dialogue - I give this element 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun ?? even the draft was good dialogue. <br /> Score - I give this piece 7 points. I can honestly remember only a bit of music from the entire movie. I'm not complaining beyond the fact that the music can be more memorable. <br /> Finish - I give this element 9 points. Almost perfect finish! I feel that some aspects of the end should be more pronounced, while others might have been more submissive, but no wires have been released. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! Watch it in the theater? Most definitely! Under Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I recommend seeing it in the theater, I know I'll be back for a second!
