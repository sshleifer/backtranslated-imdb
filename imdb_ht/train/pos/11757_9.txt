Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play the 30-year-old guy who puts marriages in danger when they decide (Russell a bit reluctantly) to re-tie the heart and rival Bakersfield year after the reality. Williams is ok, but Russell is flat-out big as legendary Taft regional Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a beautiful and attractive turn as Williams' wife, who can live without this rematch. The movie is worth watching just to see Remo's renowned in action. Very recommended.
