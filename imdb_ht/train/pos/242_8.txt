I thought that this movie was very well done, Heather Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was impeccable. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and credible. How true it is that really happened I have no idea, but it shows how people sometimes come what they do. Perhaps those of the authorities were still corrupt and I found it interesting that more than 30,000 sign a Petition for Ned Kelly PA to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? In many ways she reminded me of cold mountain that was another good movie film. All in all I would highly recommend this movie and I'm a bit baffled why she did not do better in the movies.
