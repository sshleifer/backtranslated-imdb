It takes a very special kind of person who makes a movie that is so miserable, horror, disgusting and crammed, but making it in a way that makes it brilliant and quintessence in Liberal Cinemas Liberation. Crispin Glover, in all its "antique" antiquity and predisposition, really did something unique. In a world that has become part of partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively capture everyone. <br /> Right on the stick, the movie takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a pattern at all) and initially forms it with the love of the Shirley Temple in front of a swastika woman and nude pleasuring a man with palsy cerebral. It's rather shocking thing, but if you had the opportunity for Q & A after the tests, it clearly opens a bag of glass that lets you ask if this is art or just the lowest common denominator. In either case, you feel the tremor that this film will ultimately cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the assumed authors of the world who speak about the human condition. You may not like it, but it is certainly something worth seeing.
