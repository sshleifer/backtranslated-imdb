That's what one of the girls said at the end. Is the football game a metaphor for a skilled game between the girls (or more widely, a free-thinking group) and the authority? "For Germany" means in a future of hope? <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable Cinemas experience ever to have - despite the movie and sketch, and moderate over-acting (even though I love the cast - they're lovable and well higher waiting for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration they refused to give a game (they were female and a soccer fan) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a persuasive disguise. I wonder why there's no female section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can provide - to defeat the defective reason for the refusal. The movie is very cleverly done - the amazing title, filming during the real game, the spontaneous, and various methods to put the viewers in the shoes of the characters - the game is so important , but accessible (not shown), the luminous light and sound of batteries from the stadium, the incubation of wind, and the unnecessary of it when inside interconnected with the crowds celebrating outside. I can feel the comfort from the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course, kindness and consideration of each character to others. While the credit ends, I entertain that no character has a name - it's just any "soldier" and it's just any "girl" or "sister".
