Throughout my 60 years of age, I learned that when we look at a movie there is an identification (if we want it or not) implied with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character executes certain gestures, sometimes because the word spoken word is determined, or phrase ?? that we use or that we would like to use ?? in the determined situation. <br /> <br /> The movie in question, should see this point of view. Who now finds a parking space ?? In a mall, downtown, or on the street - taken by a car with drivers can not remember to think that it is not the only driver in the world? <br /> Who does not have the urge to "tire out" the sick face to spit? <br /> <br /> Haven said I asked: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES!, Then try not to get absurd details ?? comparatively with reality life ?? in the movie, because you will certainly get the ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>, and does he seize the bowels to use it?); 2- In the sequence in which Terry dies also falls; 3- In the sequence in which Della gets attracted by calling the "Mermaid of Chuckie". If you've already seen the movie, or if you plan to see, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies, movie fiction, politics, movies and movie where you can " wash your soul "? Explaining the past one, we can quote: "Tropa de elit". According to the newspaper, there were unanimous applause when BOPE officials took certain attitudes. (As I saw the movie in DVD, I could not respond to the reactions of the audience). <br /> As for partial direction (Susan Monford), interpretation (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition (William M. Anderson? 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card'? Outstanding Exceptional, 'Robocop 2 ', etc. It is well located in context .. In a scale of 1 (awfully) to 10 (Masterpiece), I to "When it came out" a 7 (regular).
