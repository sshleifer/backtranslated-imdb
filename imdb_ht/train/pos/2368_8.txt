The plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter former cop went through the "Peacemakers" after his friend was killed by the leaders. While there, she discovered that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do anything to achieve this goal, even killing people. The cast is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist alongside another bad guy playing Matthias Hues also is a good martial arts. The direction is good (scene of battle too) .The rest is OK, with Tony Burton who plays a friend in Kurt killed from Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl .From producers of another movie action / martial film (Bounty Tracker and Lorenzo Lamas) a good movie action. The best of the Martial Law series.
