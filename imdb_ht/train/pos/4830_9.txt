Although some revisions were clearly Luke-Hot, I found the story totally engrossing and even though some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boons', so what? It is good for us to see a hot story, earning in real love in these cynical moments. Many of the audience was renowned and surreptically wearing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are enthusiastic fans of each other, though, for political reasons, it was a marathon wedding. I did not even feel that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to regain the Queen's youth, may have played too much as a mischievous mummy. As it is rumored that it was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with his mother the Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convinced as the young princess, stalled at the stifling palace and courtier and politician from manipulating her. It's brilliantly showing the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which works well as never before, under his reign. I believe the word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for the most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.
