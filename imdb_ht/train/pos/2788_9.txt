This is a so-called 'feel-good' movie, but it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent but my parents did not let me study at the academy of sports, as well as the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to leave football. <br /> And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the fighting youth there and expectations of their parents have. An English-American girl with her parents, with the tradition and strong family relationships, and the other side of the English family with a daugther dressed as a boy, and playing football ... a combination that concerns her mother! This film also lit up the lives of ordinary people, as well as the American community in England. It is about to believe in your dreams, and live one life (where we have heard that before). <br /> <br /> Paramager Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Play Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff. In contradiction with his sister pinky, filling the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> A real must read, to see how a young girl beautiful wrestling with the traditions of parents, and to get her chance eventually. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as American hit songs. <br /> <br /> Pleasant to watch, but if you, like myself, ever played football, and never make it head, then this movie will make you melachonic.
