Hopefully the note has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review that convinced all of you to go and watch the movie so creating an instant choir in "8" s, true movie. mentioned before Chris Rock is the King! Previously going to see this movie I was not on the top of him, but now I knocked on the doors of Chris Rock's web site begging him to take me on as his protector . This movie is really funny, if you do not find this movie funny you really need her therapy and humor that is the purpose of all areas of society including race (warning), division class, love, treasure, work, dream, comedy stand. The list goes on. <br /> There is only one slight disappointment for me however. This was that in going to this movie I did not realize that it was actually a remake of the "Heaven Can Wait" another good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such I was quite surprised when I watched this film and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I was watching on TV a few weeks ago .. Whatever film is in My opinion is the best version from the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers with the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any ... get the picture. Well done in the current scheme of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there has been two reviews about IMDb so far that was raved angry about it, go see it because it is this funniest thing you might see in a long time, go and see it because it's a experience movies that do not let you murmur nauseum in the cost of movie tickets. Go see it because it is a good movie!
