There are some very smart humor in this movie, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. However, after a while she just looks like a drill in style (despite great gags like Balasko continuing in Dussolier, and very good act by all involved) and I wonder why Blier made this movie. Everything is revealed at the end, when Blier, directing Claude Brasseur, gets a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional and obviously heartfelt. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film exciting at all it's always running. Some really beautiful scenes and sequences, however, with anyone who likes these 'sacred mosnares' in the French movie should find a fair amount of fun out of this movie.
