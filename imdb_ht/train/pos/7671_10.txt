Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! Anton Mordrid was on Earth for 100 years waiting for Kabal, an evil sorcerer, to come and kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to form together as children, so Mordrid knows Kabal tricks. <br /> <br /> The movie like a little confusing to start with, but fast you feel part of the action. I will not give away the finish, so go and watch Doctor Mordrid! <br /> I found the movie to be very enjoyable because it does not have much violence in, or sexual scenes. The movie focuses on the plot and that's what I love! I find the best films are the ones where times seem to fly by. This is because you are so engrossed in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is an awful movie starving! I give it a 20 out of 10. Worth to see! <br /> <br />
