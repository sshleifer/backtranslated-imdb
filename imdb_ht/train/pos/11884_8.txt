I found this movie to be a fascinating study of a family of crises. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV + the reactions of family members alone with one another touched and strange. <br /> I never saw a family who were as physically present as this one; nor one chance to call to each other. I did not understand why the family felt that younger could not cope with the news but once past that hard I found this movie quite moving.
