Here's one more beauty of the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of stars that host other lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only to its controversy in cross-ethnic conflicts, but in personal and political conflicts in ethnic groups as well. For example, there is a moment when one of the high characters, openly gay, is visited by the hospital by his companion who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him before his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of left discomfort washed into the room. Clearly the young man is not as open as it seems, and the family is not as accepting as it might want them to be, while the companion is confused and dismissed. A good deal of complexity is packed in a moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master of efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity in short sequences. The film is also effective for the same way but it presents the mutual brutality that Israeli and Palestinians are inflicting on each other. If you do not feel sorry, you will cry to the last third of the movie. Even though the plot is melodramatic, it's so intelligence writing and acting that it reminds us of how to satisfy good melodrama cases.
