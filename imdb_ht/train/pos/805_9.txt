"Back to Thursday" is often remembered for what he did wrong rather than what he did right, and that is a shame, because the latest chronological slang of legendary Star Wars is a dazzling example of epic storytelling . He managed to wrap all story lines into the previous movies in one grand finale, and he does so very compelling. <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably serve to expand the Star Wars Demographic - and among the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire legend, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in film history. <br /> <br /> Back to Thursday has done many things that tends to neglect: it presents an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which came from a little implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" very convincing here), an exciting opening at the Jabba Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as Emperor, Luke finally comes to its own, the resolution of Solo and Lea's romance, and moments are very powerful final on the Indor moon . <br /> Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a movie generation that has long nitpick every single scene. It's always a piece of magic and moving in movies that also serves as a big chapter. It's not a movie 'good' - it's fantastic!
