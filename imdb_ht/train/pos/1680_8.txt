Well done and stylish while still finally making sense of this thriller would work best for fans by giallo to get interested in the genre than the Argento entries later that go further in all directions. <br /> For fans of these Italians crazy Evolution, they will appreciate George Hilton and turn his character captured and what he put in. The camera-work is cool and sniper in graphic and odd violence, but appropriate choices and a good score by troubling music as well. Less than you know about the best story of doing it work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing in keeping this out of being a great Sergio Martino is jealous is that the story does not have that extra sexual or psychological, or both the elements put on the head . It is a routine mystery, the characters are well defined but live or killed according to the scheme by their own virtues and deformities. The last DVD (2005) release is beautifully looking and definitely the way to see the movie, unless these ever find art home quiz that look like easy.
