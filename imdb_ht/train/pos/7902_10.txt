The film is outstanding in her gay iconography and finishes this beyond the asthetics of the music and cast. Throughout the whole movie exists an amazing child as seen in the eyes of the main character. It takes the spirit of the world around us that is funny and beautiful. In a way she's a slacker movie for girls. Watch this you fancy a relaxing movie midnight. Buy this if you like differently taking over the world of media and love combining (?).
