This is the ultimate one-man show in which Eddie Murphy is at his very best. Just forgot the Nutty teacher and the distinguished men, this is Eddie Murphy's real. His imitation of Mr. T. (pretend it is gay), Michael Jackson and other artists to assassinate. I think it's also quite daring to make fun of artists who really are popular at that time. My favorite friend is one of where he is in his annual BBQ and the family and plays his drinking father and aunt bunny who dropped out of the stairs. <br /> <br /> Show this is the best medicine when you feel down! If you look at the end of 'Raw' do not be disappointed. It is also good, but does not match 'Delirious'.
