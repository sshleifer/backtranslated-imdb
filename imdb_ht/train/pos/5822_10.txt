The three stooges were still some of the many actors I loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they did. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also many other great actors and actress stars that a lot have in many of the shorts! In my opinion Three Stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and is ever funny comedy team! <br /> <br /> This is a good three short stooges. It's funny and its cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, Jan Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin, and Bess Flowers. Stooges are done very well in this short! I recommend this one!
