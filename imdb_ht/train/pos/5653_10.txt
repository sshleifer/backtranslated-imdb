This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a show some way back when it revealed late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air in its very stylish pair. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I can see) to realize what a really innovative set of this is and how it keeps in the imagination. I now understand in reading the comments he received CANCELED that's just so incredible. What a bunch of 'turkeys without turkey' should have (or just maybe they are) running around doing this.
