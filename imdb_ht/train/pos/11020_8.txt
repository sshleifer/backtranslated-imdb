This film is a spectacular, interesting, visually interesting photo action and lots of black humor as well. This was one of the biggest hits in 1993. This is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a terrific funny thing. Stallone certainly made a brief comeback to this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a movie-maker. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp amplitude sharp (2.35: 1) and a terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has a follow track followed by the director and comment by Stallone. DVD also has technical crane techniques as well. DVD has behind the featurette scene, two deleted scenes and introduction by the director and more. Do not miss this action movie great. Screenplay by Micheal France (Fantastic Four) and actor: Stallone (the Rocky series). Based on a quote by John Long. Excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (Alieni, Demolition, Legend). Oscar nominated for better sound, better sound editions and better visual effects. Panavision. (**** / *****).
