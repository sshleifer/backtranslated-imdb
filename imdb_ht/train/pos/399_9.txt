This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy film, you should love this. This movie is the Asian Lord of the Rings: A high fantasy story, based on current Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this movie draw-less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you loved Stormriders or Warriors in Heaven and Earth, this one would be right up your go . This film is still very difficult to find in the U.S., though it was purchased for US distribution along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Monkey Iron. Well worth the search !!! This DVD is also worthy of being.
