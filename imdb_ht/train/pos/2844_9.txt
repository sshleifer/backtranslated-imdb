I saw 'New York: I love you' today and love it! I was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'Paris je t'aime' and in general I think I liked this one better ... Maybe I need to look 'Paris je t'aime' yet I do not know .. I read some of the comments here on NY: ILY and yes, the movie is not its perfect. When paying tribute to a city like New York - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems sufficient enough to make justice justice ... so without exploiting any of the movie's imperfections, I'll just write about what I liked. <br /> <br /> Unlike 'Paris je t'aime' in which every director's film was well segmented and titled, NY: ILY is not and many reviews about here have been found transparency in history and overlap Character here annoying and even confusing. I thought otherwise. I liked how the stories just shone one after the other and I especially loved the overlap of character - it might be gimmicky because it does often in films now. But I still love it because I did not get it forced. And the idea that we all connect to the end has a quality, smile, even capricious it - which some can get unreal, but I get nice. <br /> I love all the movies, but one of my touches was one of Yvan Attal and Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper. It was so well acted with scripted that revealed to the end - yet not the rest of the past - led me to tears and I was crying throughout the segment that followed. I still love Wright Penn and now I am also a fan of Chris Cooper. Those priceless first few sequences when he stood alone outside the restaurant, just before he got the call - talking about Cooper's ability to transmit a character not just that they had to say nothing. Most <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> others for a long time. It seemed to me (and I would be wrong) that the stories were different, but they all tried to drive home the point, the same need, to just step back and look at a new light to those things We were known in our lives for a long time; They see people and things around you and the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time. The other films that I liked were by Shunji Iwai and Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci, by Natalie Portman and Carlos Acosta and Taylor Geare, by Brett Ratner and Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby, by Shekhar Kapur and Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf and Jan Hurt and once again one by Yvan Atak and Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana when they're in the bar. I really need to see more work by Yvan Attal as I seem to love her so much! <br /> <br /> In general, watch this movie with an open mind. Do not read the reviews before watching it! He might not live up to your expectations of what a movie about and about New York love should be and I doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. Just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful scenery scenes, some sad-of-life comforts and a story or two that might just tug your heartstrings.
