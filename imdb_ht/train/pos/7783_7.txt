A young girl survived as a whore. <br /> A cheap hustler wishing to get the big score. <br /> <br /> They meet each other in Thailand. You can think of the opening titles of a violent film but it's also a story of love and two people in their own struggle to get money for a better way of life. This film feels like an essay sometimes because of its change in images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke but it is well said" says a character and it also applies to this one: We've seen the story, but this way we see it. Thailand looks at hot tones, the picture will be from one-colored in a multi-colored location. And he took the city as the casket of this imperfect man. There is also a good use of the music dot their actions.
