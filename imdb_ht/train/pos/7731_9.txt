<br /> <br /> "After dark, sweet I" is a strange mix of sensuality and durness. The film runs slowly, very slowly, but takes a pace to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a true performance), and Rachel Ward is all but sexy. The sexual tension, the pshycological heat, the footsteps of the past ... The flashback scene, strange to Patric's character, all becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this one cause is the most sexy movie that I ever saw. Check out the scenes, it's particularly sexy.
