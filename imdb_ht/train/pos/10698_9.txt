A funny movie. It is totally incredible, incredible, impossible. But it is funny how an introspective masochist can become totally dependent and fascinating, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows, but who could get down to his phantasms. Of course it is a denial of the crazy deals that you can find on the Internet. You should not believe that ten percent of what you are saying is and never, ever, ever accept to tie your hand in one way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. Most "business" have in one way or another go to fool you and attract you. But here the chap worthy of being victims of these gangsters because it is not only naive, he is absurd to sleep. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends with the victim of the crooked business that has the upper hand and end up playing the game even with his victim and has. Someone think is sure too. The English airport security is not exactly what it should be, but I guess it's not best anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened all the rules and regulations it's just fun to go through the procedures and the systematic foils . Then they have their revenge not to lose your luggage, a real misfortune on modern airports, and they do not expect to get fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle or open box because it can be harmful. I can see myself off my way to the side of the plane and a box case. Funny, is not it?
