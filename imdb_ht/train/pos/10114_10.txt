"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the life of man who made us movies such as "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster", and, of course, "Plan 9 from outer space ". This exquisite film is far beyond where other documentaries, such as "Look Back at Angora" and "The Compact 9 Plan," Fail. He rounded his survival entourage, many of whom went away from film, and provided an honest exam at Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that he looks back at the darker edge of Hollywood's time, sentimental to his treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who likes the director to fail in it days. All two hours of the movie are humorous and retrospectively pieces along the ed and evil deaths for the viewer. Best look at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.
