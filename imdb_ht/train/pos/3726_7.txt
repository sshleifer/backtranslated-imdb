I did not expect the highest caliber of making films and Joel Schumacher led this one, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In technique, it often derives from saving Raven and the unstable camera work, gray shots, the film occasionally runs like it's jumping a sprocket --- all these techniques Speilberg used to make his movie look like more realistic but in the end was more distracted than anything else. <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RIA, the emotional element was not as weak, as the characters of this movie seemed more like real people and the story less versus, not so wrapped up in the American flag ( Speilberg gets an 'F' of finerness) <br /> Next to the first section of the complete JACKET Kubrick, this is the most realistic painting of boots camp that I saw in a movie, and for that I think it's worth look. <br /> It's not a big movie, but neither is it a bad movie.
