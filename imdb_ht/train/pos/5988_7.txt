This film 1939 tried to capitalize on Michael Curtiz's best film "Angels and Faces". As Ray directs direct, the only thing interesting is how to appreciate these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the teens in America's inner city today. The movie is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were quite scared together. The dead children die have larger parts as the scheme focuses on them rather than in the older ones. In a way it's curious how fire has been used in the same way some property owners scrupulously did in later years here in New York. It was the fastest way to turn a property around to never consider the social issues it created. In today's climate with numerous weapons around there is a new reality. The young kids in the story seemed to pranksters only rather than the criminals. How to change times!
