"Castle of Blood" (aka `Castle of Terror ') is a quite strange venture, from Italian storyteller Anthony Dawson. Excluding black and white cinematography, flawless doubling, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate rhythm and a surprise (though totally appropriate) finish putting this one apart. Only these movies are sometimes hokey music and love rather than bridle on the first eye 'love between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) but an otherwise amazing movie. <br /> While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sat in a pub, telling one of his ghost stories at Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, asked an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of its stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expressed his doubts about life after death. County Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night at Blackwood's castle, one night those Halloween when the walking market. Alan can not pay the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday, '(aka' Mask of Satan '), the' Bloody Blood 'fairly stopped, the momentous violence even more obnoxious, especially surprising of a Director usually associated with these awful Italian movies in the 60s. Found is very deteriorated (and recorded) boiler and scan versions. Even so, it is well worth seeing, and weeping out for a modern rumor, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Hewitt Love in Elizabeth's role. Watch it and enjoy a movie that fits well with Robert Wise's 'Wise'.
