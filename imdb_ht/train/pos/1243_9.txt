Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. In a movie like "The Golden Child", especially. This is a movie you would figure would be star Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone. But Eddie really does work; It is smart, funny, brave, kind, courteous, economical, clean and everything else a hero should be. <br /> <br /> Have you chosen to secure a Mystic child who keeps the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied perfectly by Dancing), Eddie goes from California, to Nepal and back, all while beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonder if he is all saying he is with an old fool of the holy person (Wong, perfect as always) to know that he is. <br /> It's interesting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the hero of action only I know who might start a movie by making a rude note behind some guy a porn magazine and finishing it with smart-aleck remarks on Ed McMahon. <br /> No problem with this "Child": it's a "Golden" get. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
