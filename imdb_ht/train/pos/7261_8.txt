I agree with "ctomvelu" regarding the talent Jim Belushi. I happen to love Belushi a lot. Admittedly, I was uncertain when he first appeared on the scene, because I was like a big fan of John's late brother. But Jim has a scarf on the screen that has gotten him far - and has been developing it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of her earliest films - her weight is a gift (is not that true for most of us?) - and I love the movie. Yes, it is touching and happy, so if you're into car chases, explosions and gossip free, then you might want to spend on this one - it's a hot movie of three lost plants that get one and others. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the three key aforementioned in a successful movie, but I love a beautiful, solid story like this one. <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch deliver excellent performance, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely adorable. <br /> I do not know what happened to his career, but who will be responsible for dropping the ball (silver? parents himself?) should be shot. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and yet nothing of note has been heard from it since. <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
