Although written by Stephen King, an overwriter writer if ever been one, this is actually quite fun B-movie. Vampirik, incestuous creatures that live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgin, great cemetery scenery, heroic cats and very pretty girl. The soundtrack even has the Enya music, an idea that I found well ... nice. I'm sure King is disappointed in this little movie, although he has dialogue and ideas, all of them come from a true and tireless king potboiler. (Kwake Sleepwalkers, if I understand right, is a script without any stories or stories behind it). Still, these earrings in ointment spores show that it does not use a ghost-writer after all.
