Beautiful Family / Comedy drama begins MacClaine and Garr who amuse and warm the heart whenever I see it. Recommended for all ages from 9 children of age grannies. The beautiful period captured 1962. The story encompasses Garr in difficulty, its two children and Mat Zena (MacClaine) are trying to make ends meet without someone as head to home. The "family" heads of the west take the inheritance of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr a run down, ramshackle side street cafe right from the late 1940s. Garrels of obstacles, such as the sweet, but determined mother, become the whole family in the restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ...... Zena mathematics is an old circus scene and tricks cards, magic pads and a sense of jetters in humor ...... he loves to find the kids and it's funny and sometimes dangerous ... .. What's next is a delightful combination of "Miracle of Lord" thrown together with the Cuban missile crisis (with authentic TV news from the actual event) and a "ghost" tour that gets totally out of hand. This film is a fun, philosophical, religious issue and provides a remarkable unnerving fear in the October 1962 missile crisis in Cuban Missile. At the end one leaves with the wonder of faith, family and love to uncover. Oh, and music from the era of the early 60's is just great! <br /> <br /> Recommend strongly as a FEEL GOOD movie 10 out of 10
