Believe it or not, in 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very, very few films have been longer than that back then, but that's definitely not what's going on this odd little movie apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy might look much like production begins to love in Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that look just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy have yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so maybe that's why bugs are used! Using stop-movements, bugs are moving and dancing and fighting amazingly well - with a heck of a lot more realist than King Kong 21 years later! The movie begins with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a gay club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But unfortunately for Mr Beetle, he is caught on camera by a local film scrub. Plus, she does not know her, but Mrs. Beetle is also carried on with a painter treating healer. Of course, there is a lot more in this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is age-old and very fun for adults and children alike. <br /> <br /> Strange, but also very amazing and timely.
