After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that has something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but it was always OK. Morgan Freeman was just as good as God. Jennifer Aniston has some good times. I miss Steve Correll on "SHOW in everyday!" I love Tom Shadyac's choice of movies. He also made LIAR LIAR, ADAMS PATCH, and the NEW PROFESSOR. Of all three of these and Bruce Almighty, he took a great comedy star and told a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, can get his talent, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it's hard to find. My biggest complaint is to use more biblical references. I only remember three specific Biblical references and were three funniest parts of the entire movie. I guess that the first few drafts of the scenario had more Biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid to offend people. That's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> My class: <br /> 7 out of 10
