Taken into the context of the time he did, I found this a refreshing movie. While the details can be 'dramatized', the overall story was a nice primer. In addition, I found the spell actor I knew a real pleasure. Who would have imagined Ben Cartwright as a loose cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting you. As in the high casting, this film (as one would expect from a movie made in late thirties) boasts an attractive character actor, but the top string is right handed by Andrew Jackson's Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful, and competent ships acting all out, I recommend this to anyone with a taste for the camp a little, or an eye for a double-period piece, set in the dawn of America , and made in a great time period, with top tooth actors, they were a real pleasure to enjoy.
