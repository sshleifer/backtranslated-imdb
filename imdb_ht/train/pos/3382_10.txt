Not often I had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary. But clearly this movie has seed a prevention. <br /> We should not tend to be alarmist and see Armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions at the moment. But did not say this in "1984"? James Orwell was known on the Web to become reality soon after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he might reconsider his story as he did. Stop rewarding. <br /> It does not matter. What is important is that we often consider ourselves as superior in our environment but indeed become emotional about an "love apples" when needing knocks in our doors. A snapshot of ourselves in old age. Regardless of the time-line will prove to be for us, I know for a fact we have not seen the beginning of it again. />
