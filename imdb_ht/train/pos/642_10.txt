I was dragging this movie about four years ago by my French actress friend. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I sat in my comfort chair at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hated this movie, hated myself and even hatred the French actress. And then ... .. <br /> I do not know what happened but I pulled in the movie in such a way that I was not in year. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke down and made every change from them. I was in the theater for closing in four hours, but it was worth it. I think that great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then drop you to talk about with your friends about coffee or drink. This movie did. It was one of the best experiences ever to have. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
