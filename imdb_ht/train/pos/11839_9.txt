This movie was very fun. The band (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also enlarged and dramatic. The film is made from a mix of traditional animations, combined with generous computer images. The result is really stunning. I watched this movie at least once a week with my kids and never crammed into it. The story is compelling and well-known. I do not understand anyone who would file this movie less than a 7. Define a guard in my house.
