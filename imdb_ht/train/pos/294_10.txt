An important and financial arc when first released, critics have turned and claimed that this movie is the best Director. A La Ronde like the film's feel rapidly developed as the guys at a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, Jan Ritter and Blaine Novak) scare, fall in and out of love with some of the most original and beautiful women seen on film ( Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Many of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting that films in a brilezy feel. Ben Gazzara is excellent as convincing head of Audrey Hepburn after casting solo Colleen Camp and seeing cab-driver Patti Hansen on the side. Jan Ritter uncertainty follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately fell in love with her. Blaine Novak has a few girls chasing (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great performances by a supporting cast. The standards are Audrey Hepburn (he does not have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (with an inspirational choice for a romantic lead) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as Christy Miller's singer. It's a pleasure to look like it fire in line with a rat-a-pie pie pie. Highly recommended! ********* star!
