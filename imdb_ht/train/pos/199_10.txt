I saw hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classic (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Wings) but among them, my favorite is this movie (it may not be the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I watched it on IMDb, I noticed I immediately laughed myself because the movie was so beautiful and well-done gosh-darn. Marion Davies has proven this movie that she really had great talent and was not the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> The story involves a hick from Georgia coming to Hollywood and all hoping it would be an instant star! Its experiments with the interesting cameos of stars in the era make this a real treat for film film and a must-see!
