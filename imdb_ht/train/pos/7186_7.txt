There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the youngest to see. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Fighting Legion is somewhat different from other Zorro films. The first is a republic series in 12 chapters. With this time, Zorro does not play by a top studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but rather by actor-Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as a strong presence on the procedures like these other, he does an adequate job, which is helped by the fact that he is not the single hero here; As the title implies, it has a fighting legit to call on. <br /> Another great difference is that the environment is not California. The story here takes place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man poses as a living god induces the indigenous American population and a lot of bans to help him in his plan to reverse the revived Mexican newly established. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least an incredible cheesy moment for every episode, from the bow to "twang" bow to the sound effects of funny action. But in general, this represents one of the best reputable series of ever, and probably the best Zorro. The plot is stronger than most series and never gets incomprehensible or sink., And there are lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones cinema will notice many bits borrowed from this series.
