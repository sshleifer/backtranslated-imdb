He ran from 1959-1973. More than its longevity is hard for this series. He also survived the change in fashion and taste from the 50's, the psychedelic 60 and remained popular in the 70's. <br /> I remember repeating this series. It was a successful combination of all its components in history, cast and production that made it exceptional. Lorne Green has its iconic character in this series. His appeal was in all generations. All members of the family can enjoy this. It balances morality with violence, humor and gravity. A set of cartoon was made as a turn in this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series does not repeat and many will not know its meaning.
