This film was not encouraged here in Greece, though she received good actors, great script and pictures rather good is not a so-called "Blockbuster" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it's about the hard time that a new one went on when he returned to his village-village after being released into a 5-year prison (drug) end is rather sad. Mourikis is trying to keep up with his party and cares very well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for one more time to close off excellence ... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression!
