I like this movie. The songs and story lines are great fun. and the song "say goodbye" always moved me. What's a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life, in a way that you actually care about things made of cloth and cloth and whatever. great voice and great talent. why were all the other muppet films that came after this one less less interesting, moving and funny? is it mr. Henson is just so much missed?
