This is the best picture on baseball since Redford whacked the natural way our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into life. <br /> Face and dream - the flow of reality, the American dream is regressive after 9.11 and a true story about the Mid-Life Devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian-born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays an authentic West Texan better than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? Thrown as wannabe, the goblet and humble winners and psychological luggage as many average viewers at the audience. It is real. Chemistry of screen works. If you like bass-hot driver, you will love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there. My popcorn became a 'fashion' there. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! Rock music and bring the fabulous story! Synchronizing words and music prompted the story forward exactly as it should, a profiled area me more often than not. <br /> <br /> Critics: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about 'characters and hearts'. St. Rita and Nuns have been a beautiful decoration, but they never really find their place in the story to open and close around them. Shortly. Worth every minute of the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
