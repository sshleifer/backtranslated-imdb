YETI deserved the rating of 8 stars because it is one of the biggest movie ever made. I saw it in a midnight screening at L.A. and people were roaring and cheering in the crazy - this movie is one of these enormous cinemas where you think it can not find any stranger and have it done! The millionaire who funded the project to get rid of the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both pouring into a suitable trial suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors ever appearing on screen - and yes, There is a Boy mute (which kind of looks like a girl) and it is mute since it has survived an aircraft crash that killed both her parents (hmmm-perhaps therapy for the kid). Then this Italian hottie girl was seen by Yeti (once he thaws - that takes FOREVER) - and it is immediately in love with it - which is one of the most hysterical things on the movie is that This giant yeti makes "eye eyes" in it - it's like a great Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, once the big yeti picks up the hottie and he against his chest - he accidentally touches the Yeti's tip and yes, the movie takes time to show his great gray nipples !!!! Yikes Of All Yikes! Plus there's a dog breed in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and it was varied as they tried to get a Lassie - there's also the crazy scene where the yeti ate a giant fish - caught the fish great and use it in the girl's hair comb "Gee, thank you Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dying dead. You are the best." This movie is more rare than anything Ed Wood could ever dream about. If you are a fan of classic classic crap - get this baby out.
