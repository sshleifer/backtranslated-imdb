After seeing this movie for the 3rd time now, I think it is almost Adam's worst movie PUNCH Love DRUNK is worse in comparison to this I must say in the end when Dickie threw into the boat it so Funny (the hair is different with her and I love it when she jumps all.) This movie should only carry if you are a real Adam Sandler fan. <br /> <br /> The poor characters in funny movie comparisons Its like the Waterboy, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks depth and a story line decent and worthy to be at 100 below
