The but simple camera both gives some almost documentary feelings in this movie, and also relates to the pragmatic films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever got bored of these Hollywood-style brick bricks and brawny guys who receive james bail assignments would envy? Fed up with the bride-living-sole joint, divorced-but-family-man, the individual donut and the harder hunter? Ever wonder how the real police work is like? <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Put in the north between west Germany and Germany east, former DDR, a set of post office clerk begins his work, fresh from poleschool. He quickly finds his way around the usual customers, and gets accustomed to life as a policeman ... but this is not much fun. Other German crime films such as Derrick, The Old and Safe dignitaries are talking calmly with suspicion. These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting view, even more if you know that part of Germany a bit.
