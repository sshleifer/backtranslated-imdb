OK so a 10 for a 2 star movie 1/2 you ask? ... well see this one and maybe it will make more sense .. Hitchcock never intersects the scenes together well .... The movie tram scene simultaneously from the outset and yet you do not find that feeling your spread sometimes get when a movie runs you to the many characters it tries to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they do not disappoint you when they do. Screenwriter / movie producer Phil Hay's movies in life, blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation of life than the movie by the same title ... I'll be looking for more good things in this to the producer of the future.
