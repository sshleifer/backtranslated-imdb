A famous conductor decided after a heart attack back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes in Dutch and the local church choir, which will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign movies that are not English, and I've already seen a couple of Swedish movies in my life, but this one was the best too far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, in which one is the exceptional act. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as conductor, almost timid and devoted to Daniel Daniel. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is enchanting with her smile and her subtle act. Choir members are well developed, interesting characters and their own stories. This movie tells a story, a wonderful story, about music, love, pain, memory, death, about a man devoting his life to music, and trying to create a calm existence in the village where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and the way his life was until then. Home Pollack shows us that Swedish are outstanding movie creators. Going to see so it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's also comforting, in some ways.
