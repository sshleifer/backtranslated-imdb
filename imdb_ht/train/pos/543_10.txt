This film is the best movie film, bar-none. I like Stanley just dumps the women in the lake. I was a fan of Judd Nelson's job for many years, and she blew me away. It's a mixture of horror, drama, and romance, not many comedians. Watch his bad, but charming capture me right then and there. That in his eyes I will never forget. There's something about it, I cant describe.
