"Xizao", is the story about the conflict of modern life and ancient tradition, and its effect on a family of China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), a businessman returning home when a letter sent by his brother Ming Ming (Wu Jiang) made him believe his father Liu (Xu Zhu) died. He found that his father still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, public toilets. <br /> <br /> The movie center of Da Ming's family, and how she learned the importance of her father's work, something she has always been considered an old tradition that must have died soon. Also, the film explores her relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and issues in the small community and how the toilet is a place that cleanses body only but also the soul. Two main themes of the movie, the family and the issues of progress, are incredibly well-organized, and the movie never loses the point it tries to do, both the very good themes developed and we get a glimpse into Chinese society and customs . <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, leaving the character characters to do the job. It's a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I'm pretty sure that another style would fit the movie in this good one. Zhang has enormous potential, as it can tell a story without the help of visual rocket or camera tricks. The act is outstanding in its natural approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost seems as though real people were being filmed. The three lead characters provide remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show. Even though the movie could have been sticked in an "old day's best old" employer, rather than taking an attitude of balance, saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and maintain a balance between modern life and the old traditions. , and film touch. 8/10
