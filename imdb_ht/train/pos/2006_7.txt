At this point it seems almost unknowingly that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was already established by his critics to winning in other films (Leading Man, No Looking Back). But in the case of anyone still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can act with this one to expect from him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who bumps out on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I generally would not watch a horror movie. I've come to expect to focus on Gore sensational rather than dialogue and draw. What pleases me most about this movie was that there really was a solid scheme being moved together. The throat is not so much as to become concentrated in the film and not have a disturbing realistic reality in film and higher efficient budget techniques. So Gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike a movie action such as the U-571 where the dialogue takes a seat back to the bomb, we get a chance to know the "good guy" and actually take care of what's happening in them. A few scenes left unexpectedly (such as Derek's delusions) but you get the feeling of certain aspects as they have laid the foundation for an end. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown in Hollywood in this film, that will never happen. These few cases are forgiving to know that vampires might have been a continuing series. Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. Is it a great way to spend for hours being entertained? Yes. He will not let those who fear horror movies and insomnia and will not let the horror film lover completely disappointed either. If you are somewhere in between the horror genre cockroach and the horror genre lover, this movie is for you. It comes in a happy way with the effects and tales of one another. <br /> <br />
