When I first saw this film, the first thing I thought this film was more like an animated movie. The reason is because it involves vampires making incredible demonstrations. Exhibitions are many like the Moving Matrix moving moves too fast for stuffed stuff stuff and jumping around very far away. Another reason why I film is good is because the adorable animated will face them during the movie. Gackt in ways to make his pouting face or just way to act, very animated. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action of this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde is also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fan, you have to see it.
