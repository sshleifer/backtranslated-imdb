Here's a frightening, finding-a-bad story of revenge guy starting a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. It is three personalities here: a bottom-and-out-low-key-now-drunk mercenary, then someone loves daddy-type of a girl and then a brutal maniac on loose answer and revenge. <br /> The story is about Washington being hired to be a guard for a little Indian girl living in Mexico, where kidnapping children come regularly (at least according to the movie.) It gets attached to the kid, played winningly in the actress children of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the responsible men and spare no one. Beware: This movie is not for the squeamish. This is stylish movie-making, which is good and bad. I love it, but a number of people who have found it too frenetic to taste like the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tension scenario and it was fascinating to see, but it's (unstable camera) is not for every taste. <br /> In addition to the stars, there is still-interesting Christopher Walken's, in a low-key, uncharacteristically role, and a number of other fine actors. Film of the emperor's emotions are the basis of all of us, but it works.
