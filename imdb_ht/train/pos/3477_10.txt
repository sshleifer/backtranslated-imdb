some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined .. I agree totally showing the quality was not up or down and scratching, winning my opinion, as a very good chrecter.i looking at a poll About jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of those who say scrappys second series were scoobys downfall.OK for loads said yes, but 28% still cant be wrong. I do like the way most of the episodes focus on comedy.i believe the show would have gone garbage if it was even 5 people / solve mystery dogs in the same formul.scrappy even was a breath of fresh air. .The whole episodes and segments were very funny .I was intrigued by the yabba shorts and .But at the end of the day it is a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion, there are certainly no fact involved. But in my opinion this was a superb series that gave a start of tire shows us worth formula and lease of life.Nof said.
