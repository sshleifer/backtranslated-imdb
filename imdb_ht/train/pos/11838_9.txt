This is one of the coolest, relaxing, and beautifully made animations I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, the sounds and music can make you feel like you in the movie! This movie is not only great for kids, but adult too. It teaches you lessons, as you forget about who you are, you can do everything you stick your mind, and brave and daring. This film can make you cry at times, which is always a nice touch of movies. This movie is funny, sad, beautiful, and keep you on the edge of your chair! Some films really give you a soft feeling after you see them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a nice idea for a movie, she gave me a lot of spirit!
