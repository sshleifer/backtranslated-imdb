If you enjoy Cleese & all the British humor 'Pythonesque' at the time, then this little gem is absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! I saw this with friends on television when it first came out, with its classic quotes being part of our joke for 30 years, and will be done forever! I have it on tapes and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some revikers are taking it too seriously. <br /> I can not believe it is now only available in the U.S. (NTSC of course), and not in UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of British humor!
