The appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual image moving to life more than 100 years ago. Here are a lot of people leaving a factory, all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the inventions that they will walk before. I was shocked by a single review called this movie as boring as today's home video, and at least another mistake to identify it as the first movie ever made (the first movie was made at the rate of 16 frames per second, rather that then-normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see is a lot of people filling out a building and passing the cinematic on their way home from work, but this is a piece of curiosity for dozens of reasons, not least of which is that it was the first movie made by the Lumi√©re brothers, who probably had a stronger impact on the movie's development than any other person or group of people.
