But I thought "Nanook to the north" was the last word of semi-doc 'eskimo' echo cinema. How wrong! As a hungry sea-kayaker I stayed up to 330am watching this hope to get a glimpse into some hand-made 'pot-boats'. The film did not let me down. Any student in kayak / umiak construction should have a look-see here. (Note that SKERS: they seem to be using Norton Sound kayak and single blade pedal). But the movie went way beyond this strange interest. Though there were as others noted some little back-injection-fakey-bits films many hearts are just a minor annoyance. It was (from the very anthropologist's opinion to this amateur) probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early Thirty: The 'Talks', so new to them (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually let the Inuit speak in their own language. And there are many who have always been, despite the infused melodrama, authentic. They are really incredibly polar bears, candles and people of Caribou. A fifty version of this movie would have been so cheese and 'star', Technicolor, gum etc. it up. The sixty version? Not even. A very good film compilation of this excellent film is "The White Shadow of the South Seas" (1928) Geographically the iceberg image of "Eskimo" it also deals with relentless and profound disruption of Western culture / technology on an unsuspecting person.
