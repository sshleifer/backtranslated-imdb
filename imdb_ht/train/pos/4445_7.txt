This melodrama early, in black and white shot, is a minor movie, yet Flair's show of the German director to improve tired story lines in something resembling art. Set in 1910, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who was guilty of abandoning her small town and family for lunch at Chicago stage. He never fulfills his ambitions and is drawn back to the town he was left by a letter eagerly from his daughter to inform him that he also took a sympathy to the theater (a high school production, that is) . Back in her old town once again comes against small-minded, and she has dealt with her hostile older daughter, disoriented (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The plot has nothing new but the cirkel sets itself apart by creating sensory composition, with each shot frame injection, and it is to help immeasurably not have Stanwyck as his leading lady. It runs a 76-minute dry, and that's just as well, because the material does not really have the feet to go any further.
