First, I would like to say that, while I know my share of star wars, I am not a fan. I do not know how many chromosomes a Rat Wamp has or the family has extended to TK427. What I know is this: Star wars, all the movies (less so and 2 episodes though), captured something magical. It's hard to say what the Lucas button has been boldly convinced, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I must explain. Star Wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. It does so so obviously, so profoundly, that literally anyone from any setting can understand. Episode VI does very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and dad used and manipulated him, too, with the addition of the prequels, revealing even more of the story back behind. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader in the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth of it all. It felt real, as if capsules fell from the sky into Lucas's leg, detailing a historical account of a far and wide galaxy. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and I must admit, every time I see them, particularly this one, I feel very small. I feel like I was pushing into a world where good and evil are clearly defined. I get a tingle feel when I see them, a feeling that something, somehow, touched me more than anything physical can ever hope.
