The title says it all .. <br /> I'm not a movie critic or I'll act like the rest of the snobbish people to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie did not have a multi-million dollar budget, but the draw was very well done, the act was frightening and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had a lot of fun to make this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on one channel instead of both, but I imagined this could be a mistake in the recording of the DVD. <br /> I will definitely be check out other movies that produce brain damage movies! Dylan O'Leary, dropping and crew, I thank you!
