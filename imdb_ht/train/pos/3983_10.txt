Fully deserved its prestigious Hollywood nomination award, this is a fine small gem with lots of pizazz and some succulent surprises. Exceptional comic scenes include a hilarious shooting (and re-shooting) in a WW1 Slot scene and Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimist who does not com and McDoakes are hated as a gentleman Boyer / Colman ?? All Beady Ralph Sanford's eyes are delightfully irritable in the end; a McDoakes lost guided and re-guided by equally embarrassing Jack Carson; Assistant Chandler director at a McDoakes-throwing opportunity: "I'll be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace Funny O'Hanlon has a double role, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! Strange, Richard L. Bare who plays himself in one or more other enters the series, has turned down the opportunity here. In real life, Bare's a young, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here she was imitated by veteran actors (more than 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
