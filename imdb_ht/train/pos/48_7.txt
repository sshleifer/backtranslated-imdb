I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for this ... This is one of those little known movies that only play once on television and spend looks like disappearing into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS collection video and came across this title, I watched it, and had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent. <br /> I must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why I'm sure. This is the only movie made by this director ...? How come she did not do many films after this rather good ...? A potential person should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really want to see that he pulls his act together and makes a good movie like this one, please .....?
