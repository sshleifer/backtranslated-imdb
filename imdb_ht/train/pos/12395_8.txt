This is part of a short animation clip that shows the story of the Matrix, the war between humans and the car in the eventual creation of the Matrix. The animation is Japanese anime party, part of American contemporary entertainment, and it is very well done, considering the excellent directors behind the film. It shows the initial development of AI and the exploitation of vehicles by man, until the day they rebelled.
