There are many words I want to use to describe this movie, but I can not really do what I can? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity, sex, stripping, homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and that might not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Together with all the other debuts, I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I laugh now just to think about some of these stupid things to do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I'm going to say. It's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, such as Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they talk. So I keep it professionally. Best Movie. Heck yeah !!
