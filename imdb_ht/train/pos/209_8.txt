Walter Matthau and George Burns just work well. The acidity of Willy and the annoying amnesty al is a blend of heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's dish is a gem and the final stage judges up the perfection movie. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the semi-retreating comedy comedy as only he can, the intonation of the voice and the dramatic exaggerated coupled with his general misunderstanding of what will be in the form of a great characterization. George Burns distribution is legendary and nowhere is it better than in this movie, his calm aplomb and memorable dry desert replies. Look for the scene near the end when Al and her daughter ask something from the Spanish caretaker, and the Al reaction - priceless.
