"How To Lose Friends & People Alliance" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelity. He is a romantic comedy comedy based on Toby Young's book on his working experience as a journalist covering the celebrities. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a British journalist who took a job in an illustrative celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless in getting hold of all sorts of allegations alienated around him, hence film titles. It is chaotic, daring, and moral. But, nevertheless, for some very rare reasons, it is a slightly likable character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, Alison Olsen who composed, played quite admirable by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is primarily craving for sex actress Sophie Maes played by Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on hand skill but high on "eye candy" material. Sidney gets into every kind of tomfoolery in order to move the newspaper ladder to the coin magazine. These are the funny peaks moments of the movie. However, I think Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and authentic native rom-com materials by developing a romantic romantic line drawn between Sidney & Alison; Even though Weidstraughan team did formulate an odd narrative otherwise. Pegg has picked his character down to the thread and his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges has again built the "Dude" bridges and enigmatic works supported by Clayton Harding, chairing the magazine's magazine. But the rest of the acting movie did not deserve enough to be presented here. "How To Lost Friends & Alienate People" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publish it as a romantic comedy superlative. *** Average
