I visited this short on a DVD in the best new Zealand shorts, all the great but French doors were amazing. It starts slow and you wonder if anything will happen. As you relax in the hum drum in home renovation, the most spookiest thing is happening. <br /> <br /> EeeEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The films soaked in the primal fear of the dark and little, if not any, special effects. It thrills you right into the bone. A simple yet brilliant concept open all the memories of when I was young and dreamed up the most unobtrusive, but spooky situation. <br /> <br /> The visual movie producers are bang over and the lead character takes you compelling in the story. It's a good kind that I have not seen in some time. <br /> <br /> The French doors have all the features of a great feature, alas, it ends after ten minutes or so. Never mind a great finish that asks you to know more. <br /> <br /> Love it with well done and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders really turn out the talent. <br /> A new fan.
