I had no hope; I'd never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the movie has some character characters in it. I thought it was very fun; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is terrific (true, this is not his biggest role). I thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the movie and were well done. I did not expect much and I was happily surprised.
