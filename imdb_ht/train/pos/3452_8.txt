I thought it was a very good movie and should be released in the first theater. It would not be a great blockbuster but it would make some very good money. The film has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a great job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering it is his first movie he did a great job. This is a good movie to pick up and watch when you just do not know what you want to rent that overnight. It should go very well. The throw was great. So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!
