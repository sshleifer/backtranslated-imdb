First of all, the only reason people keep bitching on this movie is because they can not stand a few parts of the true story being "changed". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's movie was not a perfect proposal either. Well enough ranting. This is a very nice movie. The origins are gorgeous and taken from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the ring and up to the Battle of Helms Valley in the two Towers) and moves at a fast pace. The casting of voice is top notch and most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks awesome. The movie has a high score that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy fantastic fantasy stories but hate reading (books are even better) to give this movie a try, keep in mind it did 20 odd years ago. Also in particular note: Peter Jackson's adaptation of Fellowship follows almost exactly the same as the Ralph Bakshi (Jackson said many times how much she admired Bakshi's efforts).
