About 1986 I saw this movie not crashing on TV a night. I had 6 years. It looked like my casual look at the terrifying end by looking at Now in 1987. I went to Venice on the next year's holiday in silent horror, hoping God that my parents would not get to know I would look it! <br /> Would I have a idea if my parents knew I would watch Les Valseuses when I was a kid? I would probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays, and my mum probably disapproving in the afterlife. I do not know if they want to see it anyway. From the trap of a woman in the block of flats in the first stage sliding down the mountain roads and lattice satiated I never whether if this movie is a tender piece of garbage that respects the sexual revolution or It's a sexy movie movie to watch as it dawns about you that you can never be offensive yourself. <br /> It is definitely violent. She had a violent look at sex, virtually no recognition of love. Even a baby mutate baby in a vicious act of exploitation. But the storyline is very erotic and (my God so British) excited! Are they sucking her breasts for her own good? That's exploitation. So why do I get a Woody? Friends <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! I do not know. It ends in a really virtuous suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust Bowel, and has gone eeuurrgghh! No love for this movie, quite the opposite. Mutations where the boys started. Why is the girl in the leg shot? Why did he come back to them? Should women be punished to learn what is right in hand? <br /> I think of two movies, one of which I wish I had never seen, the other made me want it was not like a harsh world. Sweep Murder / Madonna what a pile of foliage does not calculate has never been so offended that a woman was punished for being a slave woman and her people maybe madonna she said everyone respected guy ritchie so so ugly i can not use punctuation ! Once upon a time in America / Leone God why noodles do it? Destroy the way to joy we followed him on his lifetime. So close to finally find love with Debora. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance, in both sexes. Very honest, there are no titles. No fantasy fantasy, no perfect Hollywood smooth motion. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness with jealousy and juggling here to call her a sex comedy. Forget putting on a nude hairdresser in the legs cosmetic it will come back & You will hang her up with your ex-con lover's Vengeant son and she will learn how to cum out of it. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are movies of rape and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God nobody wants to look it now! It's a brilliant movie!
