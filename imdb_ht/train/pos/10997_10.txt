WOW. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen - ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely LOVED IT! Before the opening credits made I was glued to the screen. <br /> It's a Sci-Fi Thriller - AND the edge of your chair Whodunnit. Incredible. <br /> I want'd it never ends. Lucy Liu is a crucial role. Anybody could play it. The lead actor, Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who liked games War, tennis, and track down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
