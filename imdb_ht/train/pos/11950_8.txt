I went to this movie to know nothing about it, and ended up really enjoying it. He lacked authenticity and credibility - Some of the things that the characters said and were completely scarce, and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed (maybe this is typical of Woody Allen? I ignored) but the whole audience in the theater laughed so hard. It was not even in the jokes of the movie each is, but in the movie all his head. Acting to remind me of the acting Seinfeld, where he tried not to laugh at his own joke - they are corny, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of ACTORS, not the characters . If you are looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
