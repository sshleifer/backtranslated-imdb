Saving Grace is a beautiful movie to look at a boring afternoon, when looking for something different than regular scripts and wants to have some fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana of it is like a crazy! It was the first movie I watched with this term (drug / marijuana) that did not really criticize it, only making jokes about it. Serious Trevethyn is a widow, residing in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since she was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who imagines they have some money saved for her, discovered that she needs to pay all her husband's husband to debt by losing all of her things, especially her beloved home. He never worked before, and it is in a tragic situation until Matthew, his garden who found lots of smoking pots, decided to make a partnership with him to sell marijuana in large scale.
