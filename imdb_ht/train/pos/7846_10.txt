I usually do not overdo a specific show (save to OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, i 20!), But no kidding, after an episode of Reunion I was hooked. I can not even tell how bummed I was that it's time-to-place conflict with Bush's speech last night because I was really looking forward to episode in 1987, Thursday. Again, this conflict was disadvantageous because, being a new show, he needed to build something and the second episode has pushed back a week to kill some momentum. <br /> <br /> That said, TV does not always have to be Emmy deserving to be enjoyable. I do not expect Reunion to take home any cost, but I hope it will be able to take my attention to all seasons. Ever seen the first few episodes of a beloved show year later? Sometimes you ask how you got hooked. Building characters take some time. The one-year episodes are wonderful, in my opinion. Only the other show I can remember to do something the same is 24, and every episode being an hour ... and with an experienced years is much more realistic than a day that is expected! Please give this show a shot. Relax in art form ... it's just TV!
