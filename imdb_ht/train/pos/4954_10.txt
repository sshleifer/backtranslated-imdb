A great, comic, sweet film with Morgan Freeman (who plays herself) and those who meet a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store also researching an independent film. I was a bit dubious about the movie for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store I really started to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not have any complex plots and it's easy to follow, but will awaken the infamous of humor and make you smile all the way in without having to look for little romance. It includes several scenes all the way through which to make you clutch your location and laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
