This movie is shockingly confused about IMDb. Like many films, this is not Shawshank. But it is a reasonably good, predictable, dance competition / personal growth movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female stage dancer, than I think you will like it. Judging from the ratings IMDb, I guess is that this film was approaching the top 250, and "voting bomb" and many 1s, as happens in many films that are not on the crowd, have no special effects, or includes non-white or non-character characters. br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not a US movie. Put mostly in Toronto's subtle signals, and some audiences may think that it puts entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border town of Detroit. <br /> I love the music. I love the dance (but not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> I agree the title sucks. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying these words, and he should have an "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). There is not much to hate on this movie (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hate it) so I can only assume that it's an expression of hatred for the personality of it, and that's what a sad.
