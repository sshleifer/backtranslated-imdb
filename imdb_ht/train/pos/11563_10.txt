I saw that many years after the TV series, and, initially, I did not care for her. Then, as my memory of the series declined with the passage of time, I looked again, and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the game stage by Neil Simon, it was not 'open out' much for the big screen, and that's one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and cast into the beautiful supports, particularly John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, certain moments can reduce me to water in the laugh - Felix interrupting the Oscar in the midst of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar split up and chased Felix in the apartment, giggling the 'Pigeon Sisters' brought low by Felix's fiction story, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene (later torn off by Nora Ephron 'when Harry Met Sally'). Razor-sharp dialogue too. When the boys think that Felix had taken a overdose, Oscar said, "They might be vitamins! It could be the sole one in the room!" Fantastic!
