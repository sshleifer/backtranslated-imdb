This movie deserves a 10 for her brilliant painting in the world as having self-esteem in a playboy. While I found the world morally annoyed, the film was doing better that storytelling would have to be done, and that is taking us into an experience that we would never experience. Tim Meadows is so convincingly featuring Leon Phelps, and the story thus drew me to the reckless world of Leon, so I forgot to forget that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it. The men lie the movie movie because its big and dark success storytelling at the price of its own success. Understand that the vast majority of cinemas will respond only to the story of this film that lies on the surface, and rejecting this story, I hesitate to be misunderstood and admit that I loved it. I liked it not only for its fascinating slots at the top deluded in the playboy, not only for its entertaining portrayal of the idiosyncrasies of the human sex drive, but also for its bravery courage to explore the shadows in heterosexuality. Moreover, it's just funny.
