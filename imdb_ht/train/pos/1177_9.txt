I've seen a lot of PPV in the past but this is the most fun, the most intense PPV and DVDs I've ever seen. Extra DVDs are worth it because it provides a different view of how the writers act after the show (such as Chris Benoit interview interviews / corner), some glimpse into the night night Monday, the first match of Hogan tag title There are gold and some promotional rhetoric. In addition there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Team Team: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley Against Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 This was a great good matching match starting at the show. Not too much to keep up with just the best physicallity. Spike can keep its own in table matches and Guerro and Benoit have given good competence to fine quality on the bed. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Cruise Tournament: Jamie Noble and / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The people really did not care about either Wrestler and did not get interested until Kidman made a shooting shooting press. Usually people expect a lot of great flying in a cruise crane championship, but this has been very small. In fact it was so bad that when noble hit his finisher, no one even cared or knew (you can say no of the camera's flashlight). The finish was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I never really liked as a wrestler, it lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but really did not get a chance to show off his high flying act, although he still did some good counters and added that fast pace to the game. It ended quickly that was perfect for this match. John Cena and Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny looking back at PP's very first Cena, how he used to act, how he used to dress, and how he was Used to look (look at her interview, it's very funny). This was a good intense match with Cena showing a beautiful variety of keeps, suplexes, counters and some aerials. Jeriko was sub-par but definitely helped Cena launch his career. Cena wins. <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Tournament: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both wr√®stler styles really match up well on the screen, and Brocks more power and raw energy vs RVD's full-fledged motion and speedness. RVD looks great at this match (better than its later matches with corners and senate) and match at all fast pace. The finish was working perfectly because he still maintained Brock's thick track while giving RVD dessert just in his home state. There is no match disqualification: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that missed a certain intensity as the RVD game but still a good followup. Although it started in a slow pace (which it still with great shows) Booker T was impressive and made a sick move on the announcer table. The finisher was scared, the end was a big upset and big move up for Booker T. <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Tournament: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 This was a mediocre game. Hogan comes out as usual in a great pop but its variety of moves misses intensity and energy. Then again Christians do not exactly have the greatest athletic abilities itself. This ended up being a mediocre match at best but was always OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for the Championship Context: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> Easy match of the year. This is by far the best best triple match I've ever seen. It has been closed down, many of the financial, have stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one can predict who would be from this one. If you buy this DVD I would buy it forbidden to match this. (Finish? look for yourself!) <br /> Overall this was a solid PPP and lots of extra gifts keep you looking again and again. Although this hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it is definitely worth your money.
