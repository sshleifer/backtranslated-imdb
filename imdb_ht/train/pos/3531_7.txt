Robert Siodmak performs a fabulous job and this noir starts with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Alan Curtis. And he does, I might add, without a lot of help from his male actors, so, Curtis and Tone. It's raining all the way, a lovely, leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her tokyo "Noir". Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadow, and music is truly remarkable as it tackles this genre. Shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook, egged over by an excited rain. It is the scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to new territories. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is matched only by rain, who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man. Franchot Ton had phoned this one to Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he might die and did not seem happy to have lived. And it's never, except for a brief moment in prison, seemed to be in love and rain. <br /> <br /> The fun thing about many of these films is that, as World War II progresses, interest in psychiatry is thorough. But often the themes are used incorrectly in films such as "Owned," "Spellbound," and "The Greatest Show on Earth." Tons called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his illness, but it appears closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by himself, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady does not have the greatest scheme, but it's well worth watching.
