Rohmer returns to his historic play in the real story of Grace Elliot, a British who lived in France during the French Revolution era. One still suspects that Rohmer was a conservative, but knew he was like a red-blooded reactionary. If you can setup the Rohm unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not easy to do, given that, for example, the French lower classes are described here as hideous layers), this is actually an elegant , smart and polished film. Lacking the money for a great cinema recreation in the 18th century France, Rohmer was rather the actor to play against the evolved painted board. It is a remarkably artificial artificial, but it somehow works. And new Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic to a character that should not be.
