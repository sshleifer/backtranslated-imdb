The 14 year old I'm incredibly happy that they can now really do look fantastic movie fantasies, and that they're all the rage, what and Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia History Make Money In Cash in the box office. This year will see (and already seen) several more, most notably the Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Esteler, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in the theater this week with little more than a peep. I saw no forecasts for her, only a couple of advertisers. Critical reaction is kind of blah. I would not even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see the Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else is interesting to open this weekend. Well, if you're forgiven the scarcely squeezed, the stars must have been aligned, because I went to Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero lay out to look for a falling star) filled with obstacles. But in what basic plan, the story is alive and imaginative. It's simply aimed to be a lot of fun, and a good little romance. And it succeeds beautiful. There was a lot of great movie this summer, but none of them were almost as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is said well and it's almost entirely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it definitely can handle the same type of ground that something like Princess Bride has (though I do not like it quite as much as the movie sooner). A lot of fun to be here if you're a fan of the genre.
