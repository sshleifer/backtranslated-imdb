*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Led by Woody Allen. Just after his job with Johansson on "Match Point" returns to "Scoop" a Corky, fun and funny ride ride. When a student reporter (Johansson) found a new effect from a deceased reporter (McShane) when he entered the materializer of a lame magician (Allen). The scoop being in the new Tarot four killer in London could be preppy Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and South playing Sondra detective fell in love for the beautiful would be killer. Allen finally hit a mark, not as good as "Point Match" but definitely more fun. I laugh much more than I hope, one of the years to be seen
