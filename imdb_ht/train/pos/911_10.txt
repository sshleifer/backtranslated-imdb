VIV in my opinion is the best film in 2006, coming from a director who has proven successful in all of his career. I'm not too keen on romantic movies these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I watched this movie three times now ... and believe me it's an awesome movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH goes back to the traditional way, shows simple characters in a tender and realistic story of the journey between marriage and marriage. The movie amuses all behaviors as it can be reflected in what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In this regard, Barretti Barretti has done his homework and has shown a very realistic story in a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Several sequences of this movie catch your interest immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way she tries to watch her without Do it too obvious in front of her and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when she came to see her - meaning a timid Shahid did not know exactly what she was talking about pulling in a decent conversation. Amrita's nature also limits eye-contact, shyness and answers to Shahid's questions slowly. Amrita's emotional shutters and her uncle (Alok Nath) when eating it in Shahid's part in the form of another's daughter rather than her uncle's uncle. <br /> <br /> Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress shows the role of Poonam and the beliefs that you can not imagine anyone else replacing it. It looks beautiful throughout the movie, and it shows an innocent girl with traditional shyness perfectly. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor makes brighter too. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when he comes to acting in a Bar Image of Barjatya. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a beautiful couple on screen, without a shadow of doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). Throughout this, VIVAH delivers what he promised, a well-done and realistic story of two families. The film has top-notch performance, excellent story with great movie costume film, as well as being directed by Fabulous Bark R. Barjatya. It's a must see!
