Strange enough this movie never made it to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video release. My expectations are high but where in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee there's fantastic act, an intelligent and thrilling scheme that has your guess right until the end with superb movie. Together with Unforgiven this is easy one of the two best westerns in the 90's. <br /> <br /> People who hope something on the line of Mel Gibson in the Patriot (korny) or Braveheart (unacceptable) are sourly disappointed, everyone else appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10.
