A wonderful and bravest fiction film that focuses on the inner torment of blind eyes Al-Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant it is the end of the heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was superb. But one bone to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets have shot I have never seen any water or dirt being kicked by their impact! It hurt the realism, but I can live with it. Fine performance by Eleanor Parker, again, as his girl friend.
