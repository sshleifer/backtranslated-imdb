Men's Mystery is one of those movies that gets funnier over time. There is a naive innocence and "niceness" of the characters. It has become part of our family "culture," and we quote the characters often. It's my favorite movie in the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we all love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks too. Well, we're not talking intellectual here, just Family Bonds!
