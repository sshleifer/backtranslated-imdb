As a rule, a logo full logo production is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave him a shot. <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but it's something else. The film involves a struggle with a mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate their world, with the title character. Dr. Mordrid also dealt with people, and the world's mundane authority, which he successfully. <br /> <br /> possible spoilers tracking. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions," and to do so to find a companion who watches a strong one; however, the guard was blind. Her eyes have lost her nostrils. So the wizard passes his hand in the other eye, and hey, presto! Her eyes have been restored! This sort of healing apparently only works with eyes. Later, Mordred and his "brother" host a couple of skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one has. <br /> However, side by side, the picture is not at all bad, though much like a comic book. Dr. Mordred's more "human" are okay, and Combs plays the role of convincing. <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
