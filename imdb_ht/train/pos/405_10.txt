I was a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since the school. This film is the best fantasy film of the years. I do not think that "action" is the right genre, though there are many actions and KongFu scenes. Waiting, I mentioned this is a fantasy fantasy ORIENTAL? Please keep in mind that NOT use this Hollywood movie formulas. And for the guy who "poo" around, I do not blame you, 'cause you are still young and you need to know more about "culture".
