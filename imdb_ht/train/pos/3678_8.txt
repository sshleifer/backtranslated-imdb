it is a very beautiful movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - The level of history has a great spectrum. Some of the scenes are very big and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not independent (if compared to coffee and cigarettes, each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you want to call it), but well, most stories are really good, some great and in general it's one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that's it!
