So it is quite nostalgic to watch the 1st episode because this is the one episode I definitely remembered. I like to watch the first season and yes compared to the action packed show we have now this show looks lame. but honestly I love the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than these new ones now. I thought it was interesting that Belisario's Airwolf and JAG had the same theme - the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) both looking for a family of MIA (brothers, fathers). asking whether Robert Belisario's personal life imitate the theme 2 shows. <br /> Question - Anyone who has Hawke cabin pictures. I like that cabin (as a dream cabin to me) and that's one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
