Like others commenting on "Miss Doktor" I stumbled by chance about this little gem on TV late-night without hearing about it before. The weird mixture of a bondage bond story on a sexy, but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and quite explorable war of the trenches on the other hand I was hooked in the beginning. <br /> /> For me this is one of the five best movies on WWI (others are "All the quiet on the Western Front," "Paths of Glory", "Gallipoli" and post-war "La vie et rien d'autre "). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; The horses and men appear as passengers in the apocalypse and gas masks. <br /> I only want I've stuck the movie.
