I enjoyed this movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. A number of people were the movie's, but it could be seen in the context of the story's history that it is. The film used the flashback to show Young Modesty and the events that formed him in the woman that he came. Before the Network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a slow trifle, and for my taste is not enough tension developed at the present day scene. However this is acceptable to just get such a faithful version. If you like Blaise Modesty, you will enjoy it and its flaws, if you just want an action flick and car chases - forget it. <br /> It felt like being the first in a franchise, but as I never saw it encouraging anywhere, I suspect there will be no more to follow. Unfortunately.
