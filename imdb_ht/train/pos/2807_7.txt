I kept the last half of this film on one night candle and was hit by just how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims is in his most distracted, the camera keeps going. The persistent shots of his body discovered and his concentration-camp face were compressed into a body of both moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you are already depressed. Then again do not look it if you feel really good.
