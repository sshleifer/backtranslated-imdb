... that this version of Bette Davis in this movie was better than the Novak Kim version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments here, I really prefer the version of BETS Davis, though the Novak version has a more coherent story line. <br /> However: Mildred's raw emotions seem to be more just in a sluttish girl that seems easy to become a whore. are those who are raw emotions that constitute * part * of what the poor physician falls in love with. He has emotions in despair, in failure, in "other" - strong emotions that he suppresses. Mildred Davis', on the other hand, shows her emotions immediately and without intentions. It has no feeling of despair, or of failure, or of "other"; Instead, she is merely surviving as a poor woman Cockney in the Victorian era. Novak's Poetry was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis, almost across the entire movie. Mildred Davis was ** never ** vulnerable until he actually had to go to the doctor and begs for assistance. But when he fired it - for his method of keeping his body and soul together, and always taking advantage of his love for it - he unleashes arguably the most devoted refusal of holier snobbish than the attitude you've ever seen on the screen: "I wiped my mouth I'm WIPED ME! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Realist Davis' was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb voting agrees!
