I did not see BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show, but he could not get into it. However, I saw Caprica Renaissance yesterday I felt a little lost, so I decided to watch the pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the sole side of it was on me is that now I want to look BSG as well. But what I really liked is that I did not have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what's happening in Caprica. From what I read in the net, they tried to reach the female population since BSG came in more ways, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> However, I suggest that if you're trying to watch the show doing it from the start with the pilot.
