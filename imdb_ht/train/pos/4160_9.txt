A word can describe this movie and is strange. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old for me to think it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must finally decide if he wants the body or not. Very unusual, if you're a fan of animation / science-fiction you might want to check this out.
