Rawhide was a beautiful TV series. Focus on a lot of lead trails trail by boss favors Gil Favor. Most episodes - especially in the first 3 seasons were really studying characters in Favors with his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon train they rarely dominate the episodes they appeared in. Rawhide was a true, western criticism and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance the show became a massive hit. Of course, his abilities were supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Roberts, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their mark in a TV story piece. Rawhide has captured the taste at that time in the west that no other set has for me, as yet anyhow, managed to do so. Later they tend to split their drive and give their individual story lines. For me some of that time this did not work - the animal leads and regulars to give the best stories. However there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained artistic headgear. Pictures of black and white add in a weak, realistic feeling that other western series rarely managed to take. Rustlers, Indian, Commancheroes, beautiful girls in distress, serious assassins, all were shown to issue our hero. The end came to the series slowly when the final season was axed less than half way. The reason - Eric Fleming left and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the bravest realism was gone, Gil Favor commanded respect and exclamation authority - he was never overused and this made him all the more interesting. We will not see his love again. Watch an episode every time you can, they rarely disappoint.
