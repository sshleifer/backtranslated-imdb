This is my first CG animated movie that I've ever seen. Usually, looking at other animated films made me retrieve seeing them. By Ice Age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the sabertooth hilarious squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was sporadically funny and in general fun movie to watch. The story is basically an animated version of three Men and Baby, putting 20,000 years in the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create convincing entertainers, it's something else altogether to create visual things detained with ice age is great to look and visualize its stylized. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for the future.
