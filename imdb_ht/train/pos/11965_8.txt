Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar from Woody. Fortunately, I could not have been more wrong. Granted, the Woody Scene is slowing down a touch or two, but the Woody writer / director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self in the story. Judging from the street and guffaws, the audience ate up one-Allen's material and dialogue in a way that I have not seen in many years. <br /> In a movie landscape dominated by arc-approved story software, twentysomething flavor and line-line ticket tickets for kiddies, it's a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his very personal and still rewarding path .
