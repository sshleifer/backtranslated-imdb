I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid a day on the wonderful world of Disney. This movie was in my memory for over 30 years and I was looking for it. I should say that from all of the films I've seen back then, this one stuck out more than all of them and only saw it once, I really hope I'd get to see it again. The story and image of this movie have been burned in my memory. At that day, I've never seen it after that day back in the 70s, in fact, I never remember the title until an earlier Internet search today disclosed it to me. I loved it and wants my kids to see it. Does anyone know where I can get it?
