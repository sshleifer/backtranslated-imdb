I found this movie to be suspended almost from the get-go. When Miss Stanwyck starts his narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that problems will come. The desert area, the series on the desert gas station door, everything sets you up to wait for it ... here it comes. At first you think it's going to be the little boy, but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. I found this movie to be really stressful, though I watched it before and was prepared for the denouement. Now, a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before deserving some sort of special rating, maybe a white award reward?
