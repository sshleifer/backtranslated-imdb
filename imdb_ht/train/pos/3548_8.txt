Just see this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dollars for a third time with my mother who has never seen this before. He was pleasantly surprised by the singing voice of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And he thought the Havana sequel where Simmons and Brando danced in an excellent storm. Those were my impressive impressions too, and they were usually upstream of the movie. Led by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that came as a story by Damon Runyon took a while and slowly slowed down in the non-music scene at first, but pulled it in after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not as compelling to me, but still had the charms especially during the Sue's "May" number. Also loved Stubby Kaye in "The Sitting, You're Rocking Pirate" number and performance of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theater look at all, guy and doll is not a great movie music but certainly a very good one.
