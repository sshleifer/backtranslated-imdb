My choice for older movie ever used to be "Laughton's Night at the Hunter" remains superb in my Canon. But it may have been reinforced by "showers" that are the most daoist artistic film I've seen. The care of others is represented by the flow of water, and water can make inspiration, comfort, and cleansing, and etc. is the essence of the Tao. It is possible to argue that the NOFTH and the shower terms are similar, and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity as operators of the bath represent the purest form of Taoism. I would not in any way argue against this interpretation. Both movies are visual Jews in the integration of ideas and images. But shower is presented as an unstylized view on the sacred day of everyday life that I give it to the head. I revere both.
