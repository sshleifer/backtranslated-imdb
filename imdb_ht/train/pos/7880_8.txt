The plot of this enjoyable MGM music is proven and only occasionally entertaining, faced with espionage and romance, but focuses in the film well featured on the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic dancing Eleanor Powell, abetted by Tommy Dorsey and Orchestra Read, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares bill bills with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are giving most of the comedy minutes, although Skelton is more effective when he, if he can believe, do as Powell's love interests, and Virginia O'Brien actually gives most of the movie humor as the dancer companion. The brilliant technique of Powell is proven during an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich contributed his drum skills and must see many times in order to allow one breathing to catch up with its accuracy. Director Edward Buzzell uses his great cast to move the action nicely alongside the rather deli - cated script and which he must deal with, and permitting Powell 's impatience to impede matters, as appropriate.
