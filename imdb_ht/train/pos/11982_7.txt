This is how I feel about the show. <br /> I started watching the show at reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I love the show but it was too much flaw. <br /> I hate MICHELLE & JOEY characters! <br /> <br /> Flying story lines from old TV shows. They were stolen from the "Partirdge Family." Then in the episode "Family Patridge" was mentioned. Actors who play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn is most notable, especially when she plays herself in 1 episode. <br /> <br /> Michelle the character would not take a joke but then having this kid acted out "revenge" of her sister for a joke by them. <br /> <br /> Story line has come & went to 1 episode. Joey is getting the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard of it again later. Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar. His episode 1 is football coaching, his episode 1 is coaching softball / baseball. 1 game & you are out Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey continue to get jobs really quick to have no experience. Only on a TV show. <br /> I did like D.J. & Character Stephanie. Wishful Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure & had an own adult NON drug.
