Yes, this is an ultra-low budget film. So the act is not material award winning and at times the action is slow-paced because filmmakers are shooting again sequences and not a million dollars then get edited in a movie. This movie makes up for this with an exceptional script that takes vampires seriously, explains it and develops a complete plot out of it. Aside from the vampire history, we get detailed genetic information, legal and law enforcement, martial arts activities, philosophical musings, and some good metal music. Kudos goes to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / main actor. It is beyond me that this man could have fulfilled all these roles and make them well. I think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well versed in all sorts of terms to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knowing about all of this. There are some great camera works, too, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack-something I have not seen before, but pay homage to the underwater zombie attack of Zombi Fulci. The casting is good, so far as the sexy girl is sexy indeed. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. Victims of women seem vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a budget support film budget, there should be more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. I'm looking forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
