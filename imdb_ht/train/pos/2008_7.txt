The original vampires (1998) are one of my favorites. I was curious to see how an end would work to consider using any of the original characters. I was quite surprised by how this was played out. As a rule, suits are never the same as the original, with a few exceptions. Though this one was not a big movie, the writer did well in maintaining the main themes & Vampire lore from the first one to monitor. Jon Bon Jovi was a disadvantageously initially, but it proved to be a half-decent slayer. I doubt that anyone could perform James Wood's performance in the first one, though ... unless you bring in Buffy! <br /> In all, this was a decent look & I would watch it again. > <br /> I left with two questions, though ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a slayer? Guess we'll just have to let that fantasy.
