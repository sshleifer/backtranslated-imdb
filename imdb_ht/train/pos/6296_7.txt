Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is constantly looking for his great crush. In the meantime, she works as a phone counselor for a direct psychic Manhattan line. One day, most unfortunately, his apartment building burned down. Parker and his cats make it alive but are now stuck with the job that is really hard to find affordable housing in the Big Apple. Word comes to Parker as a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) seeks a roommate but will only accept a gay male. Since Parker is right, but the price is right, she decides to pretend that she is gay. Samantha loves her from the beginning and receives her as her new co-creator. But poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? In addition, by Sam there is a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway? This is a sweet, likable, and funny movie with two beautiful stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a string of "how can I keep this cuddle" scene, and Sam asks Parker for shampoo while showering or pleading with him to keep him in bed when he gets bad news. Also, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" gay mate, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing it up with a man he knows. Hopefully, the gay community will not get this too offensive, as this viewer thinks that most issues have been treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small scale film, costumes, sets, and camera work were very nice, too. Therefore, if you love the funny stories of love, get this one soon. You will love what you see, I know it.
