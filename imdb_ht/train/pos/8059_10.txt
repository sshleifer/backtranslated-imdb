I just watched this movie on Turner Classic movies last night and was blown up by Victor McLaglen's performance: In every sense the word is a "tour of force". The atmosphere of Dublin 1922 has evoked in the cinematography and production design truly predicted techniques used in the best film noirs in the 40 's and early 50' s. Beautiful attention to detail also; During the ride Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford) wakes up, the torturers are all praying in Gaelic. Max Steiner is unforgettable. As in later films such as GWTW 1939, it affects the popular ballads borrowing local colors with a sense of location and time. John Ford: already a giant film in 1935!
