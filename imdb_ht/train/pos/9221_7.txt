Again, I was browsing in the bin video discounts and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time I found in the bin are crap crap (I mean terrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is better than I expected. I found it very engaging, even though it was obviously made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The Direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing and some good emotions. I hope it should be more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> For a thriller, this movie is amazingly good-natured. No bloody violence, no profanity, no stripping, no sex. Usually, these films require all of these four elements. The PG rating is well-deserved - not like "Six Candles" where the word "f" uses twice and has a short free nude scene. <br /> I just want the romance between Corey Haim and her love interest could have been developing more. The movie tends to be drawn-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between two of them, we end up looking at a three-minute neglect at their on-site initiatives. They end up kissing at the end, but there's a bit of chemistry that it looks compelling. <br /> <br /> The "Dream Car" is no gem, but it's fine, fun entertainment. It is quite forgettable - especially with a cast in unknown, except for Haim - but it's also better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
