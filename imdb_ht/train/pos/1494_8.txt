A stylish offering from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('Lavil Pavilions' etc.) turns into a clever 'four-hander' smart and a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt etc.) all provide stylish performance, despite a low budget that results in a few 'special effects'. The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old Chloe Franks that turns into effective checking of its part that makes one without running cold. Only spoiled by the horrendous title wanted on the film by its distributor, this underground release, a cut above the film-in-chewing gum 'n' bowel 'film, is for those who appreciate a little little thought with the horrors.
