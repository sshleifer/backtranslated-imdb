Life Stinks (1991) was a step below Mel Brooks's other production. It stars as a wealthy who wages a crazy wager with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live as a homeless man for a month. Friends shock and amused him to accept this strange wager. While she's "staying" at the bowery, she meets a lot of odd people who are homeless, one of them fancy her fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They hit up a friendship as he taught him the many tricks he also learned to live on the street. Is Mr. Brooks survived on his own without the luxuries of being wealthy? Will he have this patient? Who is his true friend? Find out when you look at LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> This movie was slagged unjustly. Make sure you are not a classic like her earlier movie, but it's still enjoyable. I liked the way Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've looked at the movie soon silent then you'll get the humor too. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
