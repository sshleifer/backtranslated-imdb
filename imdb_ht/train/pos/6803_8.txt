In one of his first cinema, Romy Schneider shines like Queen Victoria's Queen Victoria, as she is suddenly wearing the throne at age 18, learning to govern despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually romance and Prince Albert's married Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though amazing faithful to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. See this movie about British royal-speaking in German adding to its fantastic charm. On this front, one wonderful thing why an Australian film made on an English queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including British people. Maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this movie.
