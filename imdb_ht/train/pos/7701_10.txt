This was still one of my favorite movies, and will always be. Over the past years I have become the 50's / 60's saka-fi, trying to collect all the best ones they have made back then. I love so much about them from how corny they might be in how to technically correct some of them. The big and lying colors get me going too. It's a pity when they re-do some of those good old movies; They are almost always stuffing up, - just looking at the recent re-presentation of the Earth Day has always been, it's utterly garbage! Banned Planet is one of the movie space films ever, and now they are trying to re-make it too, and I'm tired of thinking that what's new will be like! In my mind, some things, such as fantastic classic cinema, should just be left alone to be what they are, classical examples of great attempts in simple storytelling, and giving people a thrill in the process. Once added to the techno-that we have now, the film just seems to be more dog meat at the Hollywood sausage factory, - nothing special at all. By the way, I noticed that the astronauts in banned planets were also used for "Queen of Exterior Space"! That just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, does not it? Hey, less money and better movie, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this movie from Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, with Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who was still the one my favorite actor), Earl Holiman, and of course the Robby Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too far-fetched. This is a great sci-fi experience!
