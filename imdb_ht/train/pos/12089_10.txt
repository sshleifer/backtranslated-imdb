<br /> <br /> Movie dominated by Raven-Haired Barbara Steele, she saw when I was seven or eight and she created permanent images of people who talk vampirically flexible and women follow a mansion, seeking blood. Steele is an icon of horror movie and an otherworldly beauty, with the opinions of dead dying dead Romero's dead night of the living dead guilty, unifying them in my mind. <br /> I do not see the connection between this film and the hounding, which is smart but ambiguous about the present forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretense, daring you fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer from the consequences. There is no such sketch as the overwrought Claire Bloom. The comparison of the haunting is superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this movie DO NOT need to remade. Not only is it a product of the sixties but high talentless cretins rates in Hollywood can not be formulated by the MACABRE formula for horror. This formula is based on one of the most important factors: GOOD WRITING. Classical classics such as CASTLE and Corman in Poe's films and R. Matheson and the Tournament at The Past share a commonality in writing. It's simple. Get a real writer such as Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic disruption. Additionally, let Hollywood try some original materials for a change, and stop exploiting the obviously superior product in the past.
