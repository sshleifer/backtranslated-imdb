So, you go to sleep? Does the woman visit the mother in law? You are in the house. Is it a dark night and weather and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher need to be stacked? So now what are you going to do? <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old fashioned cocoa (Frys is better!) Get hold of some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now go select and play Arthur Askeys world war of the thriller / horror Ghost Train, returning to that comfortable syndrome and enjoying the night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a real classic British war time! Arthur Askey and kick her side, Stinker Murdoch, amuse you and I suspect the cast, at a high octane, emotions and spills, thriller spy. It's set in the old rural England during the second world war. It is centered in a bustling group of people who need to stay overnight, in circumstances outside anyone's control, in an old bed waiting for the rooms that are discovered is haunted by an old train. <br /> <br /> The draw unfolds neatly and precisely and a credit is thrown to the whole it is funny at the party and at times really scary! <br /> (The story was written by Godfrey old boy in the hostage of the father and he is clever) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is fun and she is very at home preforming her routine for you and the cast, it also shows it can act a bit! Throw is never out of scenes though, even bear the train and help the parrot give the film the gravitas needed. Oh and when it ends, please note the lime chimney flue!
