Man and the gun are pretty much forgotten right now, but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned both Jett Rink into Giant (which was actually written for him, and was subsequently substantially reworked ) and intend to Charles Laughton version of the naked and deceased to do it instead. Despite some obvious production problems and some pimanan lighting that occasionally render both Mitch and John Sterling in unflattering tones, it's a dark dark praise that more than standing up compared with its blood earlier on the Moon as its 'crimson' city work in a city that has never had the chance to grow before they run down to badmen premises before turning out ?? possibly ?? Do almost as bad as the guys she sent. Certainly make his way into dealing with news about a family death ?? burning a saloon to the ground and goading his manager in trying to kill him ?? Do not inspire much confidence in its stability.
