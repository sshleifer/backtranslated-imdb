Bell Books and Candles were released in December 1958 and featured James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was featured by James Stewart and Kim Novak on the second on-screen pairing (after the Vertigo's Alfred Hitchcock, released earlier this year). This was Stewart's latest film as a romantic lead as he was judged too old at age 50 to play that sort of party again. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak who is attracted to a mortal play by James Stewart. She put a spell on her and fell head on his heels with her. I enjoyed the movie and cast it. This film at the time was a mild success which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Movie Comedy. GimmeClassics
