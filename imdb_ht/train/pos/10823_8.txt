I still love Johnny Concho and I wish this movie came out on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances of his career in this one. When we first met Frank in the role of the movie title, he is the brother of a notorious gunfighter who is out of town at this time. The brother hit the fear of the heart of the city and Frank took full advantage of these insidious townspeople safe and safe in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feelings for her. She is daughter of Storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two angels and other weapons came to William Conrad and Christopher Dark and turned out Conrad had killed his brother Sinatra and he came to his town to take over. They outraged Sinatra and ran him out of town. Kirk follows it. <br /> <br /> Sinatra Overnight turns out to be loose in punk and gets a man to look for some sort of backbone. It's a well-acting performance, almost as good as Oscar nominating the role of the man With a Golden Arm. Mercy for some reason has not been seen for years. Two other performances are Keenan Wynn as former fighter philosopher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand in front of Conrad and Black. Then there is Conrad in what I believe was his role career on screen. It is a villain of incredible malvulsion, worst fifty markets and talking on silver screen. <br /> But what I love about Johnny Concho is the highest point in an unforgettable location where Conrad and the Blacks are dealing with. Let's just say I believe Johnny Concho was the MGM's High Mid response and a primer for what you did when wrongly caused a break in law and order.
