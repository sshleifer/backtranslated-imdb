This is an excellent little movie about the solitude of the one man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Cluster Inspector (in Stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers). It's one yet no sign of how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, it really does not make any effort at all! <br /> It has a stoicism and fatalism that challenges any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same scheme yet at least making a brave effort for excessing his virginhood extended (it is 28 and admitting it never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor shots in Paris and Rouen, where people are software from traveling on business. They try various boxes and places, but all have no profit. My theory is that they are trying to wrong - they go to more-or-less 'gene' boxes; They should try the type of older person, their older age. Harel is increasingly becoming isolated and making a few of Niro's efforts, as in taxi drivers, asking his friends / colleagues to go with some stray strokes that pulled a beautiful girlfriend in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
