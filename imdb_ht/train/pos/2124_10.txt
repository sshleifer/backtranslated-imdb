This is a truly classic movie in its history, acting, and film presentation. Wonderful actions are replete throughout the entire movie, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart were the most advanced characters. In real life she admired so much, she likes Jimmy, and indeed gave her the basics of her first act and helped her to be more calm and her appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was still noticeable, and so warm and enjoyable to see. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrait. This story of young people, and how they eventually come together to the end is charming to look, and most fun magic. Her hearty presentations also provide other actors to support this wonderful story / movie. I totally give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 of this Golden Golden Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. A must see for all!
