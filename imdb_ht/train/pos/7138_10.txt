If John Thaw has never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or starred in the "Sweeney" and other productions, it should be remembered for the beautiful unforgettable performance of "Tom Goodnight Tom". Superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (Nick Nick Robinson in his first role), with an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of the beautiful spacious Michelle Magorian is a fitting memorial of his art. When I read this story in an old Norfolk interviewer who has accommodated a young man from London before and during the Blitz, I found an obvious mistake-time-mistaken mistake in her, and credit must go to the musicians at this movie for this error settlement. They also must be applauded by over-sentimentalising the story, and preventing what could have been turned, easily, in a bad mess. <br /> <br /> If you keep a CD or video library then this frail feel made for TV movie is an absolute must be inclusive.
