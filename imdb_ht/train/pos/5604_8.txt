If you liked the "Repulsion" Roman Polanski, you should check out the "Tenant" since it is a similar concept, just with Polanski leaving and playing the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorites in his movies - second, after the "Baby Rosemary", of course - and is a journey far ahead of the mental fall of a man moving to the former apartment in a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all inclusive and stickler on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'TITLE becomes a great deal with Polanski, who stars, becoming increasingly paranoid and succumbs to her delusions far beyond and more as the movie brings on. She gets to the point where she is dressed and acting like the former tenant and you realize she's only a matter of time before she decides to re-engage her fatal growth from the window ... the movie is a bit slow and dawdling For a while, but if you've ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it will end with a bang and this flick of films do not disappoint. It's also best if you do not question the intricacies of the quotation and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's very dreary surreal at times. Polanski is very good as shy, resident deranged that, somehow, attracts Isabelle ever Isabelle Adjani. We also get to see him running around in the drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! Damn, it's done for one ugly chic! So, fans Polanski - who can actually look past his pedophile-year-old pediatric treatment - should enjoy the "tenant" as a fun psychological self-travel ...
