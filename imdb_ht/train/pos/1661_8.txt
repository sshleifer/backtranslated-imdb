(Farmer?) <br /> while the historical accuracy can be questionable ... (and with the mass call of the LOTR is correct .. things are much easier to excuse now) I loved the art of it. Though it is not really an art home movie. It provides a little emotional scene from time to time. <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time does not explain. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Type: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
