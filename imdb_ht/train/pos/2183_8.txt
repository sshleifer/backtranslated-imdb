Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, with his insulting touch being apparent in this original story of ghostwriting composers who both work for burn-out legendary music by Oliver Courtney. Misunderstands are evidently coming out of the way quickly, thanks to the sky, and what remains is a witty and brizzy contest with some fine songs (and some more forgettable people), Crosby's best of it, a great turn Broadway legend Mari Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant give most of the cynical Barbie (Levant is in rare form and does not have dated at all). A delightful surprise, and recommend all fans of the genre.
