Yes, it gets full of stars. It's plain as days that this filling is engineering. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, beautifully unusual one day and Harris kept it on tapes, all that glories really true that you just could not be fake. Too bad he ended up in tragedy for the young man, if only one end could be written to this fellow story. Two other stages of the trilogy tell the story, and Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the role of young men, respectively. The world is expanding on the unpopular contextualized by the retelling, giving us a wider glimpse of the growing weirdness of vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!
