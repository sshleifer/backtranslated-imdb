The Wooden Horse is a very clever movie about an extremely escape and surviving escape from the British POW during the Second World War. It superbly acts with a sense of humor in humor, especially lines expressing in the Leo-Acne language-language. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks at Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is firm and fast-moving at all. Very recommended.
