Tom Hanks like you never saw it before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "Angel of Death". It's a Hitman replacement for his father John Rooney (Paul Newman) an elderly Irish fossilist. Sullivan's son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnessed what his father did for a living and both were soon on the road for seven weeks robbing the banks to deal with the murder of Sullivan's wife and other sons. Including Jude law as a reporter / photographer wants to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of pictures of dead mobsters. Films quite well captured the life drama in the 30's. Sometimes the speed bog down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustained the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, liability, betrayal and bonding of a secret person to his son. Other remarkable cast members include: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again proved to be excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
