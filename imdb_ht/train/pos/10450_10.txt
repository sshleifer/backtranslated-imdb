It was by accident that I had scanned TV channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful human beings that came to attract each other into a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other. Etan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This gall and guy, will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply in your past relationships and how you really want you to follow your heart strings with a guy or gall or deep down love and lose track of years. Jesse and Celine have great conversation, and great eye contact with a huge magnetic explosion between the two. I'm looking forward to this movie SEQUEL in 2004 and if you saw this movie, you'll feel the same way.
