"Johnny Dangerously" is a sort of hit and comedy missing with its laugh and "huh?". But I suggest giving it a chance. I think it is very much about watching. Not too many people give this movie a chance. He does work. Just think of it as a little imitation of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he did so well. Johnny is dangerously a criminal who wants to go higher in life. She just works her way up from the big bosses of a beautiful wife. And of course as a lot of these crowds, someone wants him to die. 90% of the jokes get a laugh. Like, I told him a chance. Just take your gang movie movie and mix a comedy in. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
