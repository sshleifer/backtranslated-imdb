Those who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week and look at it many times until their attention-grabbing attention has come to the grip and the possibility of being involved in a cause or even wonderful story in a wonderful place There is no other reason than because it does not hasten to make the points you need to persuade her needs in the short time. At first I was arrested in Brosnan playing a native American. Given the story line though, I think he's just dropped off. Now go back to my hermiting. -Jahfre
