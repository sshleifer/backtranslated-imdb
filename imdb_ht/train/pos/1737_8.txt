I like old Burt Reynolds movies. They're funnier and better than any other movie combined. They might as well have stopped filming after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess how can they know that was not going to be any more good to them? Man this movie good. Burt Reynolds has dressed like a chicken and drives around a racecar a lot, and Luoni Anderson's luoni is in hand, looking very warm in a purse style. Burt and Loni, these were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in his advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I'm sure that liked that advertisement! Plus there is this part of the film where the audience of the barracks is upset by something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and shows a guy at the bending audience on and sticking his fingers up his butt show off his disappointment! I laugh so hard I almost go to the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! Then never look another film again, because I tell you now: there's no point.
