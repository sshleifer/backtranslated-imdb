Strange yet emotional disturbing chiller on nurturing middle-aged people (William H. Macy) who ultimately decided to leave the family business (killing for hire) run by slowly on-demand dad (Donald Sutherland) while seeing a shrinking (John Ritter) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> Talking about a larger dilemma, but "panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "Indian Beauty" meets the "Professional". Macy and Sutherland are standing-outs here. First noteworthy for the first time writer / director Henry Bromell. I'm surprised that this film did not get a chance to stay in the theater for more than a couple of weeks.
