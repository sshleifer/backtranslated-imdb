It's interesting how the train in search can leak. I started from an article on the Cristo "Gates" in Central Park. The article claimed that the Maysles were Cristo's filmographer for years. Hmmm ... Then I got to look at their body to work. I believe one of them passed on but the other still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in the stages of creation. Gray Gardens sound very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the darkness or cut and of course it's been stocked. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women living in the past, and oh what a beautiful past was. Edith was well-born, a Bouvier, married well, had several beautiful relationships and became a singer when she was in her quanta. Edie, her daughter was a beginner, a fashion model and she had lots of beaus. He never married at some point in thirty he came home to recover. It seems there is a nervous disorder of some kind. Worry too much about these things. It is only a shadow of the world to live in though, because Jackie O. came up with spruced up the place for her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. It is a 28 castel castle that is torn down and torn out. But in the movie you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper trim you see it was a lot of mess. The Edie team comes with a very clever and creative. The viewer gets the impression that Edith loves to go naked but not in the movie. Edith was really nice and you can see the shade of her beauty as she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty of her day and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, but not for everyone. When the cat is urine behind the portrait of Edith he states, "at least someone does what they want"!
