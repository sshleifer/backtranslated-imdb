I could not have been more thrilled; Just eight years old in 1983, I went to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day in my life was about to happen. At this time, only my Star Wars experience was a few HBO protests in Star Wars. I did not even see the Empire hit back again. <br /> <br /> And boy, made that day saved for my less critical criticism. Jabba. Large rebel spaceships. The Emperor. A green-bladed lightsaber !! Wow! From that day to magic, I had to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can not even form an accurate estimate at this point. With these multiple looks, I have of course observed that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its flaws. <br /> In the context of a Star Wars film, these "flaws" are more like "Kapris". The Millions had their magic days in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had my. And this was my Star Wars movie.
