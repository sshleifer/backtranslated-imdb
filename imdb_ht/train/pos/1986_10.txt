A Challenging Tour! OK the kid who plays Oliver is a bit too sweet! Starting with the big movie, color, costume and most impressive performance this is a must see movie. I've seen several adaptations in this great novel, but this one stands above them all and its a boot music! He's a Masterful Fagan, never let his characters make a song. You never really know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions you hate it from beginning to end. Bill Sykes .... when you read the book hes a one means, and so it is in this movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife headed this prince. I went and saw his latest movie, Gladiator based on his many fine performances, not to see themselves. The music fits the times and attitudes. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
