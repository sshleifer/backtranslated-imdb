Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' American Friends. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real hit man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero gets more complicated the more he tries to eliminate himself. With little America, America does not seem to be the safer thing than the Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this film has many twisted traces and turns that seem incredible, but all leads to the discovery of catholic cells.
