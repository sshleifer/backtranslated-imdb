Viral, but naive, Big Joe Buck leaves her home in Big Spring, Texas, and hustles off of Big Apple in search of women and big bucks. In NYC, JB meets with frustration, and with "Ratso" Rizzo, a silly but humorous art. Somehow, this mismatched couple managed to survive each other in turn to help both of them deal with a bravest, sometimes brutal, urban America, on the road to an intense finish. <br /> <br /> Both humorous and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" rides on top of the vortex of change of chronic change, and thus confirms 1969 viewers that they, themselves, swept away the 1950s of innocence, and Falling, Dorothy and Toto love, at the age of 1960 in Aquarius. The film's direction is mastery; The casting is perfect; The acting is toothache; The script is dry and cogent; The cinema is engaged; and the music improves all of the above. So she won Oscar's best photo in 1969, and I would vote it as one of the best films in this cyclone decade.
