Playing out as a sort of runner close to the Great Escape 13 years later, this little British movie smash plays it straight that has no emotions and dare to do quite overkill. The first part of the film is to set up and escape after our protagonists, the second part also focuses on surviving on the run as they try to reach Sweden. The movie relies on pure and simple, effective characters, and yes, believing beliefs come to him, and he accomplishes its purpose beautifully. No small amount of suspension kept the movie ticking together, and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the frame time it suits, so a thumb of the movie may well be the first of its kind .. <br / > <7/10
