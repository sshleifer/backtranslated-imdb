Walking with Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a back look at all of us (2) specific to the past 5 million years: who they were, what they were like, and how they died out. Along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have about these species, Markets and Cavemen examine what it is that makes us human. I waited for several weeks to watch it, and I was not disappointed.
