The first time director Tom Kiesche turns into a winning movie in the mind of off, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, yet there was the taste of French movie Coen Early St. Andrew's ... and dropping into some Monty Python Aroma boots! Need to see more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one single stage in the next. Expect the best things from this writer-director-actor.
