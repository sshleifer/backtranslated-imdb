As B movies went, it was quite average (I warned the reader now that I can reveal certain key elements in the plot or other part of the movie, although I'm trying to minimize any of these trends). As a sequel usually goes, it was completely fantastic (despite a "cookie" knife approach trying to copy certain elements from the original movie movie. Despite this tension sometimes tiring, it seemed to work in this particular film, so long as The viewer could divert his attention to the comparison of the original "scanners"). The film was the same way in the series "Superman", in terms of the main character's description of his childhood and relationships with his parents (who seemed to model on the same lines as the Kents in the "Superman" stories ") and the theme of a morally best hero in extraordinary power from an early age, etc. Presentation of deep feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-adequate children, adolescents and / or adults was a term that reminds me in films such as "Real Genius", and (to a degree more superficial) "Doctor Mordrid" and hit a particularly solid code. The film had a positive message, and it was fun to look. I found some of the precision (in terms of describing certain aspects of paranormal experiences) captivating, and even deeply touched at times. These moments occasionally appeared among all the great formula driven by free sex (uality, in that case, as the sexual elements were nicely done) and the violence of B movies (or playing Shakespearian, for that matter!) Many fun to look! <br /> This is a must look for all comic books, sci-fi, "see" enthusiasts, and horror fans! With the right display in the right circles, the film can develop quite a cult, along with the original "scanners".
