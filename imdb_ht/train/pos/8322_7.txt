IQ is a beautiful romantic comedy presenting two great actors who seem to click on the screen on the screen. Draws is a typical guy bad for girls, guys become formatted girls but make the point solid that one must love with the heart and not the idea. Addition to Albert Einstein and his engineering group gives excellent comforts to rescue. In general, a good movie. Not great but good
