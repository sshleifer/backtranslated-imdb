"October the Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery, and lift your spirits. The story of Homer Hickham and her dream of creating a rocket seems so simple at first, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is as clear as the balls of coal in the mine. But Homer can not follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), her father's staff, and her friends, Homer tries to make her dreams a reality. But, as in any true story, there are many stop on the road. Director Joe Johnston reduces us to coal mines, where we witness the chilling chip scheme stooped under a ceiling of stone. With the candle and bent posture, they looked like foreigners insect more than those in the darkness. The extreme tests of miners and faces have been a constant reminder of the minor dangers they faced in their work. Contrast packed lugubrious half of them are the images of Homer and his friend rocket launcher. Under the blue bowl in the sky, rockets are placed on a pad and launched in the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> But what makes the movie so entertaining is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side as well. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. Love and support Miss Riley is obvious as well. Best of all, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not bind everything up in a beautiful bow. It tears you, lifts you up. It holds a time of reality, relevant to a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This film can be considered a complete job. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... that's a good movie to make a person. If he did his job, you will not want it to end. And "October Sky" just accomplished.
