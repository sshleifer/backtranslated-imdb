Some people say this is the best movie that PRC ever released, I'm not too sure about this since I have a place to love in my heart for some of the mysteries. I'll say that this is probably one of the most unique films, or any other studio, bigger or minor, ever released. <br /> <br /> The draw is simple. The ghost of a bad ferry was executed back to the swamp to kill everyone who lynched him as well as all of the spring off. In this mix comes the daughter of one ghost victim, the actual ferry. It takes on the ferry business as the ghost closes off to the man he likes. <br /> <br /> Hidden in dense fog and putting mostly on the salt marsh set this is more music poem than regular manure film. Rhythms of the dialogue, especially in the early stages, are poetic cadets. Similarly there is a caddy similar to the camera work as it travels back, from the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The movie reminds me of an opera or oratorio or lesson music lessons than a normal horror movie. It's an amazing piece of iron film that is probably unique in movie history. <br /> <br /> This is not the Guild Lilly. This is a low budget / mystery budget that tells you a little little story that will keep you entertained. Her story of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetic film to do with it keeping your attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dresses.) If there is any real imperfectness it's the cheapness of production. The fog creates a mood but also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry ground. Constant returns and around it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong I do like the movie a great deal. It's a good little movie that I some how wishing was a little less enthusiastic entry. It's definitely worth a look if you can come across it.
