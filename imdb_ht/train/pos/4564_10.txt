If ever there was an inspiring story that could move anyone, disable or not, endure despite the odds and make it (even when "doing it" as an expression, appropriate, there may be a wide berth that is a truth ultimately personal) I LEFT ITS IT. It's a hard movie to look at times: seeing the quietest aspects of Christy Brown's personality from two key scenes - one when his sister declares he is pregnant and is married to while his father has a bad reaction, and At a dinner table when the woman who came out of her, made it able to communicate effectively, now announced at a key moment (the unveiling of Brown's art) she is about to marry someone else - is difficult. Very, very difficult. More so because this is a man who can not react appropriately to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: through shouts, cries, and profanity aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of grief and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing against the autobiographical, but that's a man overcome his severe inability, becoming a human functioning with a force for are identified with the world of art. Daniel Day Lewis had an Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as Christy Brown was defeated, but obstacles, and Brenda Fricker did so well for his support role as Brown's solid mother.
