Based on a true story of how a man before his time - the great 19th-century American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - has made a significant contribution to how Western medicine treats people with psychological problems. Treatment of people with psychological problems, he started associating with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing psychological methods in time (brutal and unwanted methods), Walt rejects these methods and treats patients with compassion and dignity, encourages others to do the same> Walt's interaction history and psychiatric workers, patients and citizens are full in drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
