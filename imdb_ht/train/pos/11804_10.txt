Rent the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing at her that I went and found a copy of it and bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It needs to be said even if there is a rule that made the movie the best. No talk allowed while the movie is unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a song. I liked the credit at the end of the movie as well. "Thank you for the Jeep, Tom!" Anyone Tom I say thank you because without the Jeep or the movie can not have been done. In a short movie a big if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you do not mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit catching yourself a copy.
