I entered my first comment on this movie almost five years ago. Then the ideas presented in the film always seemed mostly fictional, if true they could ever transpire at all. Not yet. Now the politics, society, and media of the Running Man seem very close to real home. <br /> <br /> Consider the factors that were mostly absent in 1987 (the year the Man Run Out) present today: <br /> <br /> Anxiety and, as Richard Dawson's character at Damon Killian puts her, "traditional morality." Check <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort in the part of competitors. Check <br /> <br /> Camera everywhere. CHECK <br /> Restricted travel for citizens of the whim of government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passport ("pass pass" of the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. Check <br /> <br /> An exciting boost, intersection borders, government and the media. Check <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real movie footage (such as the "digital digital" of Ben Richards' image on double headphone). Check <br /> <br /> Jaile of conscious objectors or opponents of the current administration. Check <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> increasing the number of fringe groups reacting to alleged tightening of large government; civil unrest hacking just below or at the surface of almost every event events events regardless of its origins or intentions. CHECK, Check, Check <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a novel Stephen King. But just to be safe, I moved to Switzerland.
