This movie was surprising to me. It has a touch, a bit of center approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I've never heard about, but if you want a "Travelers", this is it. Great writing, production, and acting. I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why did not make more of this movie?
