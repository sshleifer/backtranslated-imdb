This is a really cool movie! I remember first saw it when I was really young and I used to watch it all the time like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and really cool it's how to shape the animals to do all of this. Part of the movie are sad though (like Sassy's time, the cat falls down the waterfall, and when the shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I saw the second Homeward Bound but I have to say it is not good first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and luck is the silly comedy. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, or talking animals. This is one of my ten favorite movies!
