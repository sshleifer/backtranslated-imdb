<br /> So, not a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The easy move to Goldsworthy, as it molds nature's beauty into its own work is fascinating. Watching him rolls all together at a hanging website from a tree to a close up for a few minutes while speaking to his work, and then getting the discount when the camera cuts off the wide shot. Be surprised by the ease with which it operates and then realize worthlessness when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web. The Genius Goldworthy lost sight of his limitations as his inspiration is his own nature. It is in the essential change in nature where his work, though complete in its own sphere, is made whole.
