Yes, Keaton looks like she really enjoyed doing this movie. With a jump in his stage of combat par-par, she will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young man who only does this to pay for his big-mother medical bill and sends his little brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerous until later on in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does not like Johnny one bit (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a beautiful song / dance routine while Johnny revels in it. I love the party when they're in the car that has changed! The cop who "calls all cars" is the skipper of Gilligan Island! Watch this one for the Gangster Street 1930! The gags in this movie are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look in the background of each scene.
