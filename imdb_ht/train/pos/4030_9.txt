This movie was absolutely wonderful. The pre-partition time and culture were recreated very well. Urmila again gave another brilliant performance. What I am really admired about this film is that it does not resort to Pakistan-bashing that runs rampant in movies like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a set, the film does not deviate from political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. The film is still center around the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai was excellent. The film actually shows how the people, both Hindu and Muslim, have suffered from this partition. The theme of having one religion is really prevalent in this film.
