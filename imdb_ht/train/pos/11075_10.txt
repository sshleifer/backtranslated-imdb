Having read the reviews for this movie, I understand starting to look at it with a great deal of doubt in my head that it would actually be any good. However, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The majority of reviews that I have read, said the complicated scheme made it too hard to follow. And some parts leave you confused, ending up ties up the last loose thing you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed a lot. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", in the sense that it is not funny (in fact, it's very nice), and it's a lot more intelligent, in the way you see the part of the scene out In different views (and, in one of the best scenes of the movie, Jason Statham spent five minutes in a lift with an argument with himself). The way in which it is similar to the two films I just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos, but gives a great performance no less. If you had time, and have time to think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really start seeing all the symbols and suggestions that are out of the movie. I think it's fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director of the game.
