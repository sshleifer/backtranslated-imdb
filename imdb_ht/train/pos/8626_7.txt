"Todesking" is not exactly the type of movie that makes you happy ?? The Buttgereit JUG Buttgit is a second cult monument in a row, which is actually a lot better than the infamous "Neuromantic", which exists in seven episodes. one per day of the week ?? revolve around the suicide people. In between these episodes are already very disturbing, Buttgereit inserts really awful images of a serious male body. The episodes are not all equally powerful but, as a good, "Todesking" is ranked drastically on the list of all-time film most depressing art-homes. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a person explaining his sexual frustration to a total stranger in the park, and one on Sunday, focusing on a smaller man to pull himself to die, are extremely intense and devastating they are observed. The added value of this movie, or any other chokumenary like it, is debatable and I am not even though Buttgereit has any kind of message to communicate here. There are waves to mention a string of stringent letters that encourage readers to commit suicide but especially to keep them informed about the motivation of these people at the end of their lives to dramatically. All in all, unlike I hope, "Todesking" is not exploitable or repulsively graphic! On the contrary, I could never expect Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful about the pain of human purity. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it typically shows different views of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of those flying on appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitable poor and the correction often lacking professionalism, but this is not really counting in this type of cinema. The subject is strong and forces you to contemplate the less happy? but also indispensable ?? Aspects of Life. GREAT use of tragic music, too!
