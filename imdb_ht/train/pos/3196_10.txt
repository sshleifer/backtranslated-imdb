This amazing movie for many reasons. Harris takes a very awkward documentary and turns it into a social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a young urban who is (supposed) well-liked for his many impersonations. When he decided to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is at odds with the social conservative environment in which he lives. That's the result of her doing various justice for her actions so that people will not think it is in fact a transvestite or other social releases. In the second installment, Harris exploits the struggle between Gary and Beaver in an attempt to make a narrative from the original documentary. The third installment and final trilogy is truly amazing for Harris' extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, the "Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly troubled character. He was struggling to accept acceptance from his own community and had no advantage. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distances him even further from the people who already consider him a social outcast. The movie is so real to show that, as reality, it limits itself to many reactions. Surely, one can see Gary as a ridiculous character, but it can also be identified as a confused.
