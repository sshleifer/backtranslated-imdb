Many people judge it as a fanfare movie because a lot of super stars start in this movie (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom are very popular singer in Japan). But do not judge it before you look, that's what I say. Gackt and employees are very serious when doing this movie, and they worked hard. It's a good movie with a touching story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I can not stop watching this all over again. <br /> The story was written very well but I admit that the acts are little irritating. This is especially for Hyde because his skill in acting is from the other and it is strange to hear the way when he speaks to other languages ​​except his native language (Japan). But it's comprehensible because this is the first time acting in the movie. <br /> I think Gackt tries to show us how a person can be so weak by losing the most important people in their lives. When Toshi died, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che was vampire like him because he will not let her die, when Sho's brother dies, Kei shot dead, and the best and beautiful scene is when Sho passes away ~ even I said Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up in that scene !! <br /> There is a time where the plot goes too fast as they did not say why why children can access local mafia and were Sho's enemies because they are a good friend of the past and also Son is brother Sho in law. Regardless, I love this movie ~ (many ^^). <br /> <br /> This is a movie action and a wonderful touch story.
