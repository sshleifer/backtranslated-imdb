If you're a fan or either Chuck Norris & Judson Mills then this is the movie to see. It has a lot of adventure in it. It's a great follow up to the Man's President. The chemistry between the three three stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. Personal opinion. This movie along with the original, turned out well, that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series. If you saw the man's president, I recommend this movie to you. If you saw the President's Man : A line in the sand but you did not see the man's man, then let me suggest that you do. You will not be disappointed with either one.
