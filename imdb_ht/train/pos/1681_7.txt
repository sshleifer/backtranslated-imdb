"The case of the scorpion" has all the necessary elements in order to make a giallo efficient film. The story is giant standard. When a person dies in a plane crash his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million insurance contract. The widows in Greece for the payout, but a series of murderous grouper follows it. There are many suspects, including an obstacle investigator (George Hilton) of the insurance agency and the lover widow. Director Martino keeps the story moving in a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your Vice is an Enclosed Room and Only I Have The Key" and "Who Saw It's Dead?") Is a stunning-looking heroine. It is one of Martino's best films.
