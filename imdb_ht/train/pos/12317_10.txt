A masterpiece of comedy, a prince of horror, a romance, if there is anything negative about a Chinese Holy History, it might be that the special effects look dating in comparison to modern technology. The film has a simple quote: a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt. Of course, it happens haunted as well. What I did not expect the first time I saw this film is that it's one of the beloved stories that I've ever seen; which is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you to the point. Contrary to some movies in Asian movies, A Chinese Holy Story is not difficult to swallow for people who are not versed in Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays on timeless, culinary theme of the paranormal and romance. <br /> <br /> Think of Evil Dead 2, if you throw a wonderful love story into the mix. This movie is for real, despite being neglected. It's absolutely among the best I've ever seen. Its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres, and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere, is nothing short of fantastic. Very recommended, 10/10.
