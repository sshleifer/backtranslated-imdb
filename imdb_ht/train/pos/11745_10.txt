if you have a chance to see this movie view it. It's quite shocking to part and really makes you think about many important issues but not pedagogical. In my opinion it is a piece of art ... beautifully filmed, fine music in many genres, the typically impressive level of act that someone has come to expect from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press ('Natalie' Press) is convinced of her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has a very well-organized quality that gives stability to the sometimes unnerving action and comfort of viewers of the knowledge that someone is actually actually 'normal', but the real star as always is Spall Child - surely one of the greatest actors in our time!
