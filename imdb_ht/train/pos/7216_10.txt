No one is best to spoil this piece of work! Awesome movie! Writing expertise by the likes of Ira Levin and representing Christopher Reeve's best career performance and one of Caine's best, this is simply excellent. I wish I could keep a scene version somewhere ... maybe one day I'm going. I hope this horror cross, neglected film does not become too difficult to locate because it's a must 'for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile or lover of great movie. One very few movies I could not immediately resolve or predict and worth a second look or even third, "Deathtrap" gets an 9/10 and earns every iota in it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
