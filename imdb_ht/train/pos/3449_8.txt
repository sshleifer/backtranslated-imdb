TACHIGUI: LIVING AMAZING OF FAST FOOD GRIFTERS Title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Present: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - ----------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Way back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii His brilliant animation of the Shell was triggered, which helped consolidate international acceptance of the animation - and also burrows himself in Andy and Larry Wachowski's concept for the Matrix. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, innocent (2004), Japanese animation was hosted by the film competition for Palme d'Or in Cannes, and it has turned itself as much for its style and innovative effects as to Its plots often unfathomable. <br /> Still the trendsetter, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: The amazing life of the Fast-Food Grifters ?? which was absolutely nothing to do with the Ghost in the Shell, or Japanese animation for this matter. <br /> <br /> Tell Oshii's creation of "superlivemation": not quite animated, or just live-action. Instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a simple simple paper-cutting fashion reminiscent of cameras. The movement itself is a stilted, suspended-style movement that echoes sequences from Tesuo Shinya Tsukamoto's exhibit: Iron Man (1988). <br /> "I could not think of any method but this one," said Oshii in a recent interview with Yomiuri in everyday life. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animations." Choosing to throw is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the secret band - appears as a devotee Burger fan, while renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in scarce mode. Others include Katsuya Terada, who dabbled and Oshii on the Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effect of those who worked on Godzilla movies. Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like the thing in a NHK documentary circle ?? which creates abominably the comic here as well as Yamadera 's career voice voice animated stoic character as Spike Siegel of Cowboy Bebop. And the plot itself is a rare re-imagined in post-WWII Japan in the context of various fast-food cutting-offs from rhino robot soba jordan stand-up bars; American dogs in the heat-up trays in McDonalds-inspired boutique-inspired restaurants store. "Food is a primal root of desire," proclaimed Oshii, by way of explanation. <br /> Throw in the mix is ​​a new breed of consumer: the fast-food grifters of the title, those who do not like to pay for their tucker and still fine-tuning their elaborate scams in free munchies scores. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his ulterior motive was the homage to the "art" of eating on the streets ?? Something is always considered a bit of a taboo in this country, and which goes some way toward explaining the use of "tachigui" in the title. The director of live-action cinema (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii has often misplaced the definition between the two mediums. Cellulite results here are deposited somewhere in the gray area between both formats. At times the visual experience here is exhilarating as it may be disappointing. Just do not ask what it all really means; Oshii films, which are equally cerebral and innovative parts, are often not particularly clear-story stories. Where Oshii succeeds is through a liberal dose of black humor ?? here are you finding Kentucky Fried Rat, Death by Hula Basketball, the world's fastest burger burger chef ?? and in many nature of the film surrealism. <br /> This is a man who defends the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and maybe as much of Andrei Tarkovsky as he does David Lynch. So it should not come as any surprise that at one stage a B-52 Bomberon made a fly-in of a look-alike franchise Yoshinoya. The 54-year-old writer-director seemed to think this natural. "Japan I showed in the film can not be necessarily faithful in reality," he suggests. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
