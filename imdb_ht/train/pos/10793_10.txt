There's a little flaw in this comment !! <br /> Unlike the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly set. /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills but also a great fan of Chuck Norris and while I'm going to admit that a few of the action scenes may have extended the line a little, the storytelling fit right in with each other weeks that are actually being revealed. <br /> Opening fifteen minutes and Deke runs out of the bad guys after blowing up the missiles were very busy action. I do not fail to see how many "professionals" could not hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, the hero, had survived. As for the comment on which need to "get the movie in the case to complete the time slot after the playoffs." This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January event and filming was completed in May 2001, a good 4 months prior to terrorist attacks against the US <br /> If the writer in the comment paid attention to the movie instead to try to avoid it, perhaps they would realize the plot of the story: Rashid, a Bin Laden like character, was planning to put in a nuclear appliance in the United States. The Man's President was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before trying to comment on it.
