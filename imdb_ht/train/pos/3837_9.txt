Returning to the quarantine, when cinema touched on unacceptable affairs in society "politely", found ropes that allegedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while cautioning those who know of just what was up. Probably there are no films in the decade that were freighted and innuendo as the unusual odd dark fury, set in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Saloon Violet and Casino is amazing to Mary Astor, to slip and sport a cigarette holder; In her town-handed-in-a-daughter daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor, was about 20 million dollars. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests a lesser lesbian and young, restless companion (one can only ask if Bezzerides' original script made this explicit relationship). Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely insanely jealous. Add Burt Lancaster as the city's sheriff, stir, and sit back. Both Lancaster and (amazing) Hodiak fall for Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak not only has a past and Astor, but there was a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun shed these ingredients up to a tough boil, with face-slappings aplenty and empurpled trades. Do not pass this wet melody, full bloom of kreepily exotic bloom, if it comes your way; it's a remarkable movie.
