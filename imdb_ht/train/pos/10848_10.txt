... Head, hands, and feet - a lot of the past, just like Strange Fruits. A whammy intestine. Those who claimed by this movie are either heart or under 40, and they had no experience in real things. Sad for them. This is an achingly quite well-observed little picture that is an excellent way to spend an hour or two, and will probably not even fade much on the second show. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the Fat Drummer (in many ways well the most delightful figure at all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neo-vocalist and front people all turn into super performance, and Juliet Aubrey Nice to see their eyes go with some sharp actions like Karen, who try to keep the band together as spectacularly self-destruct. Before one of all ridiculousness inflated, and the script never mawkish for more than a minute. By comparing this with Spinal Tape or the Rutles or Monty's full - it's dishonest about all of them. The closer comparison is their commitment, and that's not bad things. And any movie that can convey the memory of Blodwyn Pig - a lot I do not remember ever seen, but the name lives on - well, it shows someone in the team knew what they were about to do. A little fun, and thanks for the memory. <br /> O ... ... and I had another - little stiff fingers; a-one-and-that on steelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... ten inches to anybody? (You have to see the movie or being on the road)
