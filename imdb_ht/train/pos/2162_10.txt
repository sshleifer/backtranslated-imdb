I was amazed that when I saw this film many mekon ... I understand why some of you have this movie. Its speed is slow, a feature of Japanese films. But if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you will find this not a problem at all. <br /> I must say this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Are we Dansu?" is often regarded as a chief of Japanese comedians. It's very different from the Hollywood, e.g. Austin Powers or movie theater, in which a guarantee is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Instead, it is light-hearted, a film that makes you feel good. <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple yet fun. I was so happy to see that Sugiyama (the main role) found meaning in life in dancing. Before I watched the movie I was slightly depressed due to heavy school. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think of the bright side of life. I believe I was in the Sugiyama ship; If he could find himself in his hobby, why could not I? He reminds me of "exploring my own future" and discovering the happiness in my daily life. It is important to note that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you can find the scenes danced not as perfect as you expect, I like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance as the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> <br /> Over all, this movie is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, he does his job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> And yes yes is Aoki funny :-D
