Wow. I love the whole series, and I'm shocked by comments by those who thought he ended up seriously. Maybe it waffled a bit in 4 & 5, while staying better than anything else on TV. But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the developed themes of the more three muscular seasons. 6B began with atmosphere as an atmosphere and Janice was always keen to insight into the family's anguish - the lane line filled out on Tony's ticket to sit down and staring. Anyone who misses the implications of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's misery on the psychiatric study and its reference to the sociopath's self-deluding sensitivity to pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, and Tony's panic attacks on the ducks leave his pool resonance with Phil "wave of waves" line for his grandfather before the couple's grace in the final episode (not found in the Black Humor Chase). <br /> I could go on and off, but I'll just add that I thought the final show - starting with the opening tensions of Vanilla Fudge gives the ironic failure ("You Hold Me Hangin 'On") The terminal moments where Tony stops back to satisfaction with his family in cracks or blast apart as the SU AJ or Phil's head was, completely, completely PERFECT. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a deadly pathway providing the "jack-off ghosts" AJ derides (and then in which it promptly waits). A tip of the pork pie Mr. Chase.
