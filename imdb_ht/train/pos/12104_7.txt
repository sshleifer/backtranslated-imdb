Well executed old house horrors and very dark. Good set-up including the character of Poe, himself, talks about the history of a London pub. Although from here it is pretty much the one guy who took dances to visit the house on a particular night running out of the room room either looking for or avoiding people, it's always more enjoyable. Plus we have delightful and enraged Barbara Steele. There are some wooden dialogues with some unexplained bits and bob but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained at all, with the super music note that keeps this one moving nicely together. DVD from US and has a few extra expenses
