This is the first to watch the movie I saw in the last year! It's funny, incredibly original, incredibly great looking guy (they went for this super cool wide-screen Technicolor look at this awesome look,) and it actually has the depth of character and of what it says about society. It's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security in problem race, while at the same time let you laugh and realize how much they are life worlds of fear. Carrie Anne Moss turned into a comedy performance I never imagined coming out of it! It's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as the Father is priceless. In fact all the cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbors and the hot sexy girlfriend girlfriend (getting the idea right now?) Funny, though-provoking and just all amazing rounds! Go and see this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
