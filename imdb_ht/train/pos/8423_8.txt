This my Bush is first of all a very fun show by Parker and Stone, I thought. It is often very very funny, and its assets are subversive and crazy. South Park fans would surely find something here. <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. A lot of money must be put into this, and it shows. A lot of expensive little details. It's not a little show. And Central Comedy is not a very rich channel, but they put a lot into this show obviously. In a way I understand what was the death of the show as well though, too expensive. It surely could have been made cheaper and went to the will. <br /> <br /> The critics liked it, and it was fond of its little, but it failed to take a big audience. As we know, the show stops after 8 episodes, which I guess is almost 1 seasons. <br /> <br /> As I really liked the show it has its flaws. The problem of the show is kind of he does not know what he wants to be really. It's like trying to be a sitkon AK a parody of a sitkon at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well disposed, but in my opinion they do not always find 100% the scarce humor are supposed to be presented. <br /> I personally think that the show needs some characters that are much more down to the world for display at work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, which is the kind of realistic touch of the more looney universe. I think the quality of what South Park works. You need some seductive characters that you can relate to in a realistic way, and that makes the stuff so much more exciting too because your strength takes them seriously at some levels. If everything is archetypes and stereotypes it's hard to find emotionally included in the show, which really is what I Bush bigger problem. Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park that make sense of the frenzy of the show. We have nothing like here, and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another anchorpoint is Parker and stone flirting with the republicans. That's the only thing about them I do not really get what they're trying to do. Do not introduce Bush as nothing other than a dumb homer Simpsons adorable kind of character is kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people can not stand it, he thinks he's the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy world in Letterman and so so only satirizes every move to her ... but it's hard to understand if Parker and Stone actually mean nothing to her. It's like the joke is on us, but somehow it does not hit the mark. It looks awkward, because it does not remind you of Bush's real estate. <br /> <br /> In addition to that I actually thought the show was very enjoyable. Some of the jokes in here are hilarious. The pro-life supporter who has been a survivor of fetus survival is probably one of my favorite jokes not in any show. And the show is packed with great materials, and is sometimes insanely funny if you use yourself a little while watching it.
