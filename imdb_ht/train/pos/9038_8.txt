I liked October Heaven. Things I liked most had to be the music. He worked two ways: in the first hour of the movie, he gave the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from late fifty. At the second time, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the movie perfectly. <br /> I do not just enjoy the music, I also enjoy the throw. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave a first-class performance, such as Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> I saw this film about life's escape already laid out for you twice now, and both times I enjoy myself.
