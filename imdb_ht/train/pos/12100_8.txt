The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very odd. That's because part of the movie is in French with subtitles and the rest was armed in English from the French. Sometimes, characters change between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to get the movie to be just subtitled or just armed, it does not make any difference! Odd, but always look. <br /> <br /> The story pretensions must be based on a Poe story, though I can not remember that one. In fact, the character of Poe appeared at the beginning and end of the movie - even though he did not look especially like him. A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his chances he can not stay all night in a way home. It looks like an easy bet to win - even though the house is very creepy. However, it can not be easy, as the rich guy says that everyone who has already taken the bet has died - yet this fool is always willing to make the wager! While at home, she meets the beautiful Barbara Steele and falls crazy for her. Later, however, he learns that he died more than a decade earlier! How can this be? I could tell you more about the plot, but do not want to spoil any of the suspense. Watch it for yourself to find the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie becomes very tall to create a creepy atmosphere. The house, black & white cinematography and music work together to make a scary movie looking. As for the draw, it's interesting - especially because there are many twists and turns - so much you will ask just who and not among the undead at the end of the movie. The only thing is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was unnecessary to kill. Crazy as it might sound, I felt sorry for it and hardly seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> Also, parents may want to know that towards the end there's a bit of nudity. A beautiful woman hit appeared Topless, but it's hardly necessary for the plot.
