The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and fun, and the gang takes the modest music college of light (yet volatile) lights at Broadway full of typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempts failed with Kermit (leader of the band and author of the show) blowing himself; So the others all go separate ways so that it will not have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young fashion designer wannabe to make ends meet by serving foods in his dad's diner (the old man, then there is a particularly inferior line of non-secrets!). We found the normal appearance of the camera by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as a overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a trusting twoster), Elliott Gould (who was also in MIPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as her head ?? portrayed in a stylish restaurant replaced by the Kermit, fake whiskers, as an entrepreneur officially celebrating in an attracted advertising attire at the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director Jan Landis (possibly this movie scenes as a Broadway producer before Kermit appeared on the streets and menus and hilariously shades of color and an Afro wig!). Other Muppets are more or less than at typical tip, and (regrettably) less space given Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of a taste acquired with me, the scenes in which the spy letter on what it takes to be the romance Kermit and the waitress ?? and especially her violent reaction to this ?? are definitely funny. What's missing, however, is the climate show itself (after a re-expressive midsection where Kermit becomes amnesia and eventually chooses to advertise on Madison Avenue), rather than the spaghetti routines expected, to procure nothing more original than the ceremony wedding of kermit and her eternal flames miss piggy!
