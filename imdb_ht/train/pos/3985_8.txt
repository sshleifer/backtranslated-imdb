Watch this as a TV movie late last night either purely by chance. The Blouf for the movie said something the effect of moms staying with daughter and going on romantic trips, as I hiked in there in the hard chapel to work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the sketch was immediately apparent. <br /> It seems that the mother's mother's sponge mother is also the daughter's companion, so there are brewing problems and too many surprises. But I would have been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows a lot of space for stitching mirrors and adjusting scratches, when it arouses sorrow. The sex scene was fascinating and taboo-breaking. Should not the older woman's body stay covered up? Not here and we are treating in a delicious reaction to Mother's sexuality. Even more thrilling to the designs she made (SPOILER!) Once discovered she confirmed her daughter that something is going on here. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did not convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but what would be mine. With his wave of pre-Raph locks I kept waiting to see Julia Sawahla, whose intense face would adapt to the best confrontations of my mind. Bradshaw has a very happy face that did not bring the anger that appeared as the movie progressed. <br /> <br /> The finish is weak. If the Goodbye for Mother while leaving shame is so indifferent then maybe we could see some pre-ups of those goodbye lifting and seeing something of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she was a widower recently lost her leaving home alone she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of jam sympathy. For such a film full of emotions (and be warned of opening champagne, you will never get the cover back on) the finish is a cold contradiction.
