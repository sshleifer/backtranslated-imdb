This is an excellent film about a traditional classical family in Northern England. Filmed aside from Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force in his home. Or so it looks. Malen, the movie, based on the play, shows the complexities of family life. Thrust in support is terrific as well, and accustomed to face lending support.
