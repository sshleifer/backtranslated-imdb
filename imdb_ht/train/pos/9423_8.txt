I can not say whether post-WWII commercial comrades were produced in Studios Ealing are an acquired taste or not, but I completely addicted, and the man in the White suit is one of the best. No need to go to the well-known plot on the threat posed to both the fabric industry and the fabric unions are not an indestructible, fiber-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slingshots and arrows suffered by Sidney Stratton's naive ideals in pursuit of Polimer's vision for a fun comedy. Many of the well-known figures from the world of British actors - Cecil Parker's nerves, Michael Gough's devious addiction, and the unexpectedly ruthless Ernest Thesinger - set in wonderful performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is feasible as Daphne (just the way it enunciates the word "Daddy", making the movie all worth seeing). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
