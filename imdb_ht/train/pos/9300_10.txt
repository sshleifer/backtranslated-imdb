I do not know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra still seemed a bit too self-conscious full of self with me. So, when I call this one of my ever-favored, he has nothing to do with a tax-band tie. As another review says Mad Dog Time is about symbols, not realism. It is kafkaesque (a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when it was so good as Josef K), it's stylish, familiar, sardonic and slick. Jeff Goldblum will navigate his way around a variety of characters, trying not to get injected and acting deviously rather than dorkily, trying to stay aware of what he knows and others do not, whom he can outshoot with whom he can not . Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and look at cast-to-spot support. The symbol, the settings (one shot in motion out and Jeff Goldblum is walking down the steps seems really weird after many dirty lizardry), the dialogue (style, by practice, is the order of the day), it's all about characters communicate, not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, must have been fun. What critics were up to is really a mystery ...
