I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I had seven, the movie 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of sacrifice Gunga la. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Under the historic circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, one raised between people sharing daily life, which sees each other faces, who knows each Other names, but belong to different worlds, can only be displayed. Then at the most critical time a troubled question arises: "Who are you, first, supposed to be loyal?", Who, family, mother, whom you know near you. You do not have time to give a perfect answer, the emergency, and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer and the sacrifice of himself. Somewhere, in a confused way, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion is growing and the rhythm of the movie until one dies, just one life, nothing compared to many other fiction or reality we can see today, because This death, this disappeared unique life I lived, I shared with my friends unwavering friendship. She lived by the spectator I was. That day I released Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, later, my dear children, as I left out of then many worlds I lived in. I left all that good for them and these lines are today a short visit I did not expect to do this morning when you get up.
