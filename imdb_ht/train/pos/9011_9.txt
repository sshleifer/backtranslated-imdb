I found this movie quite accidentally, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stolen this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but the solid chemistry together made for a more enjoyable movie. This film leads to excellent movies that Branagh has made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turned here as a young girl crippling looking to fill herself was as good a performance as I saw in a female lead in a long time. Talking to a disabled person is difficult to pull, but basically only his eyes show his pain on his situation in life, he made it so credible. If this movie came out after the current wave of cinema and beautiful women "ugly" themselves up for role (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I dropped to certain Carter would be great consideration for an Oscar. If you run through this movie on the cable late at night as I did, trust me, it's worth losing sleep.
