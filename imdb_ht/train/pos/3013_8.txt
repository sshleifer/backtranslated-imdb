Talent detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) canceled his other river tour to investigate a apparently off and crush case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something more, a rather delicious murder! <br /> <br /> As far as mystery movie kills, it just does not get any better than this one. Population and suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all of the victims of Archer Coe's apparently successful suicide victims, it's really hard to figure out this one out or wrap one's head off but it's small Men, it proves the fascinating look unfold before us. Even the cops, the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful, caress out characters adding a level of unexpected reality unrealistic to this one procedure and ampinging its overall "fun" factor. I particularly enjoyed the funny scenes including the Coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), which seems to have been brisk and prematire interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injuries during this run time. Also the detective Eugene Palette Sgt. Heath is welcomed, often delightfully funny at his expense, critically criticized during Vance's inquiry. I can not think of any valid criticism of this film in fact except perhaps that it has not been dating particularly well. Do not stop the movie from being just plain fun to look though. Look and see if you can wrap yourself around this mystery. Highly recommended you try!
