In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), colleagues and friends remember how hard it was while looking for a scoop. Meanwhile, Joe's deceased discloses the identity of the cruel bloodthirsty killer in London. Reaper's cheats and appearing in the American student of journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the midst of a magic show by Sidney Waterman's (Woody Allen) magician in London, saying that the bandit is Peter Lyman's Aristocrat (Hugh Jackman). Sondra slams south in his investigation, seeking evidence that Peter is the assassin. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy outside Manhattan, actually again in London. It's ironic and clever lines are simply fantastic, and I laugh a very inclusive and fate it to heroes in a driving country "in the wrong side". South Waterman is very funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent form as comedy. However, presenter Muse Scarlett Johansson, whom I am a big fan, has more than-acting and is annoying in many moments, has changed her inclusion inclusion into an igre pronunciation. Her character is absolutely funny and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably the first time in her movies). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and refreshing entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("The Big Skoup?")
