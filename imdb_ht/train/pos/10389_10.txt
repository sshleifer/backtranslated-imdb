I saw this movie when I was a kid. She blows me away. This was before the TV days, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid in orbit. It's so impressed me, I went to see this film for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as was Rex Ingram as the genius. I found myself singing "I want to be a fisherman" for months after film left the city. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was like a villainous character as you would ever want to meet. Also, June Duprez has never been favorite than he was in this picture. The color was exceptional. Give this movie an AAA!
