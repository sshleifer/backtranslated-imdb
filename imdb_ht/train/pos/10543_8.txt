A light-hearted comedy, Nothing shows us a world that we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you do not like is to be a fireplace of bills, a bad memory, or even hunger can disappear from your wish. They approached this movie very well, with an exciting duo starting, there were only a few things I did not like about anything, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): Good for a chuckle, but what have you tried to accomplish with that? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we just heard a random assortment of noise and shout. He tried to set up an end to my opinion, and was not really needed, nor was it funny after the torture was reinforced from frames. Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD, and as others have already said, it promotes a horror movie that never gets. Oh well, my poor marketing guess. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your movie movie store, take a look, because there is nothing that is a great movie to watch. If you have a big screen though, you might want to put shades.
