This film is essentially shot on a hand holding cameras by the actors in it. In some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video journal from its killer is full of a "Columbine" style attack. While this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an insight into how easy it would get away with. Through the movie you show how actors are illegally reducing shotguns, made tap pipes and came up with an action plan for "Zero Day". The actors (if you can call them) were brilliant, they obviously lend heavy from having their own lives, but in no step I have detected them really act (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of the CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was engineering, but I'm not sure if we needed the most recent scenes. Overall though a really good film about a very difficult subject.
