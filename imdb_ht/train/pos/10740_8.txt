Born by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and narrated by Robert De Niro and James Hanlon Firefighter, this is a compelling and heartbreaking story of how New York's finest day is. The first time I saw that when I was a 12 year old naive, and at that age she always touched me. Knowing how severe 9/11 really saw this has expanded the entire effect of 9/11. We have found out which heroes were, how have daily life composed, and how to put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save themselves. These brave people put their lives on the line and watch this just increases my admiration for them. Look if you can, this is the best documentary I've ever seen.
