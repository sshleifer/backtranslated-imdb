I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the sneaker when this series was revealed. I must say when William McInnes first appeared to me, that is one vile actor! But as the series continues to tune down its performance and I totally love it. She was like a rotten guy but she made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bone, Monty Full) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers playing a beautiful, quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom's 'Tom Longs' muscles! Signs ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total and really brilliant hit. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a role, and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy history with a twist and watching Tom Long walks around with no shirt on ...
