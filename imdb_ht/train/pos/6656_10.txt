This movie is simply awesome. It was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb. This film did not create any conflict in India (as far as I know) and its advertising was also kept low.Initially I thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its tender and add a love story to original stories and spoil the whole thing ... most of the Indian viewers would agree on the topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> There were many films in India that would become important milestones or hit mega if part of love love should not necessarily be added. <br /> <But her treatment is very similar to pinjar film (also a must look). If he counts then I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) to make such a big movie.
