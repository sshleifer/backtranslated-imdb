A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie you do not see everyday. She has excellent actors going with an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but holds the role as it holds John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kill everyone on earth and leave a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a new direction on it. <br /> A man (Bruce) sent back in time to find out about a virus that has wiped out most of the types of people. The actor was scared. I must give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) met at a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> The principal has done an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a devastating future by a human virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the virus world did it feel like they run the world when people drive through underground installations. and to be seen and also to be owned. <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> 10/10
