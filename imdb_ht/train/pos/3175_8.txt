It's great how this movie pulls you together. I was laughing honestly. Do not worry that its low budget causes the stuff to work for me. To be honest my wife did not really go for it in the same way but it prefers a different kind of movie. He admits if he was very creative and well put together and probably all about a string of strings. The characters in life are strange and troubled to give me something they are related to in my own world. Just keep going and be who you are. The dreams are what you do in them. In this movie a second and third time I realized that some hidden moments were passed by me for the first time. What can I say, I love my hobby and some complexity. Anyway loved it. Hope to see more.
