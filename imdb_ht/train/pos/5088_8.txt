I never had an inkling while watching the movie that he meant for the idiot box. I always thought this was some very good movie success in late 90's. But after I saw the internet that this was meant for the TV, I was shocked because of a TV movie, it is absolutely fantastic! <br /> The thing that especially concerned me was the length. I felt that the one on one battle scene would have been removed as it was completely unnecessary. Also, he began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is a strong, very exciting, fascinating and magnificent and magnificent performance by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who looked decently turned a bit stupid at some scenes. <br /> I was pleased by the beautiful landscapes in Africa. Also, the first half of the film would make me this movie a 9. Still, it's a great movie for the TV. 8 out of 10.
