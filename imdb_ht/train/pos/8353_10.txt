I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night back when they were only one and only movie pays the duo of existence. Back then he was unridden and was the only movie of its kind ever to show on paid TV ... especially back then. I would like to see it now as an adult where I should more just understand the adult theme of it. It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen in porn at the young age of 7 or 8. Luckily I had babysitters stupid and party-to-go parents on the weekends. Most of my memory in this movie was the completely ugly sexual behavior of these guys. Breaking home from breathing chickens, feeding on a foreign milk breast in a public bus, and manure of a taxi at the request of one of the female subjects was just a few of the escaping escape men whom they were pulling off. A very movie film for the early '70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this film was such a thing. Most people I talk and never heard about it.
