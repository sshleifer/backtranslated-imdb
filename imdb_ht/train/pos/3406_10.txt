In terms of visual beauty this film is exceptional! I had no idea that Technicolor came out early. Although I did not like the finish, the movie all is fantastic and makes me want that I was in North Africa. Throw is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so enticing and I just love her in this movie flick. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not find on the scenery and lay them ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there ... The Legionaries also carry a "Beau Geste" feel of the movie. They certainly do not make movies like these again. Do not fail to watch this classic!
