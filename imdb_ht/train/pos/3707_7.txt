I found myself in six and seven while watching this one. Altman's touch and zoom in and out were there, and I expect these devices to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they sometimes were free, sometimes witty, often unable to score points out some ironic or other connections. In particular, two zoom-outs from the dolly bowl of savannah merely embarrassed. To be fair, though, a few zooms (outs and ins) of Branagh increase intensify his character, a La Pudgy McCabe or the Philip Marlow. Overall, the zoom was, quite, consistent, and sometimes even trite. <br /> Other Almanesque devices, like multiple veins in glass between cameras and subjects, succeed in suggests character 'artisans or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge. Ice cars, windows, and other screens are being used effectively and fairly, I felt, harking back to the player and even GOODBYE LONG. A few jump-off campaigns, especially in a commercial television suggestive, remind me of the use of short coupons, sardonic effects. <br /> But finally, unbalanced between Altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of Grisham-genre momentum, failed to motivate me. Chief of the 1970 director reviewed and deconstructed different types of classics, including the detective chandler film that seemed in some ways; This time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analitik earthquake to hit any significant blow to the underbelly soft in this beastly genre. Has he been muzzled by famine producers, maybe? Or do I miss something, due to my weakness in the genre it takes over here? However, the filing was excellent all around: Tom Berenger (for his dire face), Branagh for his (deflated) hubris, Robert Downey Jr's haze, Robert Duvall's method of garbage, and Davidtz's femme-fatality cache near perfect choice all. But except for a few slips from Georgia in Chicago on the part (brunette) Daryl Hannah, accent was compelling south. <br /> <br /> Suspension and mood were refreshing, though the story did not quite rivet viewers. The atmosphere of a barge pre-cyclone hurricane diving was exclusively, rendering performance - I felt like calling to Usher to turn on the cooler swamp pronto. <br /> <br /> Tear, in the end I judge it a 7. <br /> <br />
