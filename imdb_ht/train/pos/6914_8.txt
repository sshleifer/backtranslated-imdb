This film has one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances, as an actor who plays a dictator and makes it so compelling that his own mother does not detect the empowerment. Also, this movie is funny, yet there is a reliable side as well. What is especially intriguing about this movie is Madonna's character, who is the mistress of the dictator, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress political leaders has added many of the quality of the story and the movie's entertainment value. And the main character, who at the beginning of the movie is a difficulty actor and a bit of a buffalo, evolves too and at the end of the film to resume commands. I liked this movie.
