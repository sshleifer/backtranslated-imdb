After watching the trailer I was surprised this film never made it into the theater, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time watching her, saying that this movie is much better than some major animation movies out there. Of course, it has its flaws, but I can still really recommend it. The animation is well designed, very fun and unique and the story keeps me watching it all the way to the end. Some of the backdrops are just gout-dead gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance feels somewhat dead, but that's how Lian-Chu's character shows in this film. So, in general, thumb, I love it very much and I hope it is successful enough for all studios to involve continue to make great movies like this. I would recommend giving it a chance and be surprised how big a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of her moments are Stitch-like hilarious.
