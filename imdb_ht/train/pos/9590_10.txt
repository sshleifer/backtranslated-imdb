Documentary begins in 1986 in NYC where Queens and Dragon's troops hold "balls". That's where they dress up however they love, strut their stuff in front of an audience and they voted on. We get to know many of the members and see how they all keep together and support each other. As one says another - "You have three hits against you - you're black, gay and a queen." These are people (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only in the balls. There may be whoever and whatever they want and must be accepted. Then the movie cut three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragic for some). <br /> <br /> Sound depressions but not. Most of the interview people are actually very funny and get a lot of humor from their situation. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - as they should. We find them all living in "home" running by several "mom" and helping each other out. The sense of community in this movie is fascinating. <br /> <br /> And this movie from 1990 was controversial - with a big hit. He won the best-selling documentary at many festivals - but never nominated for awards Academy. The reason was "Black and Spiritual Dragon Queens by Academy materials". Fascinating is not it? Homophobia and racism altogether. <br /> <br /> See today it's still a great movie - with a piece of period. It just is not like that again - NY shows no longer exists. The balls are always kept, but not in the mind we see here. Also dragging has become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard the houses go away. This kind of sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know of being killed in AIDS but I have no idea about the others. And what happened to 13 year old and 15 years old to show? <br /> Still, it's one of a kind of documentary - fascinating, funny and fixed. A must see all the way! A definite 10. Where's the DVD ???
