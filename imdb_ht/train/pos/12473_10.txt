A hot, touch movie that has a high quality fantasy. Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb. Samantha Mathis has given great performances, but there is just something about this one that will hone your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you've got to see this amazing 5-year. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by his presence, I bought the movie so I could watch it again and again. It is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress.
