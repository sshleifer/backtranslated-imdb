All of them do not even come close to the sum of the parties. There are no problems. This film features a line-up of some of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some really famous names of the cast. The segments are invented around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the resemblance to the finish. Actually, considering that the approach to the theme from all the different directors takes shape so much, it's amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same movie. There is no great effort made to turn it into a whole. This buffet has many great ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in a single dish.
