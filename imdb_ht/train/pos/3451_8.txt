First of all, this film was not released in the theater (TESTEMUM quite hard to say), I say to calculate the story of croaking cops, politicians and dedicated newspaper people made to death, just send it DVD & Cable TV > & take money & run. <br /> <br /> That was said I usually love this type of movie, especially with this called cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Still, John Heard & on the left, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. They were made to death, but dropping above bring life to violent films & it is actually watching. <br /> Justin Timberlake is well-suited to young reporters for a cast-edited journal by Morgan Freeman, others are either crooked cops, & politicians or gentlemen decent, 2 ladies are girl friends at LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & doing what is needed, It is quite violent, many assassination etc, not for kids. No means is a movie of great, but for what it is & the cast It is definitely good, <br /> <br /> Evaluation *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) in 10 )
