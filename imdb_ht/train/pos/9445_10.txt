This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking for sometime before the rape scene. And when I saw it I really shocked thinking "What kind of sick movie?". Today I've seen it from the beginning and really understand how big this movie really is. It's interesting, scary, shocking and in its own unique disturbing way. But the best thing about it is the end of the audience to show that this experience will hamper the characters for the rest of their lives. It will twist their conscience and will be worried for the rest of their lives on the bodies found in that river. And nothing can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most joyful endings in film and very clever and glamorous films and anxieties <br /> And the act is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Magnificent acting in this movie. All in all, John Boorman created one of the best movies in all film stories based on Dick Dick's novel. A must see for all the movie lovers
