I just came back from a pre-release look at this excellent sci-fi movie cinema. It's style is definitely unique and very well done. It is filmed with current actors, but transforms into a black and white-striped-white style you never saw before. It goes one step beyond Sin City, and it does well. It's a successful combination of French comics and film films. The history and artifacts remind you of Blade Runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. The scenario is smart, never boring and it has some pretty little twists. This film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely do not like sci-fi or b & w.
