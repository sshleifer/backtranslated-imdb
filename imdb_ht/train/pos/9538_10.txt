Why are not more films (especially Americans) more like bullet machines? <br /> <br /> This is my first online review and I'm charged with "Electrical Ecstasy" after choosing "Ballet Machine" as my first effort. This is a review, so I'll try to think only with bowels of emotion. <br /> I mean, this is one creative piece of work though it is inspired by the classic TETSUO now! So what if it's not all the original? I own both of these films and though Tetsuo is one strange son of a brunette, Bullet machine is far superior and can sit in without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of drug idea to change clarifying meaning movie. Bullet machine is as elaborate in its history as it is in its high bloody and gore mob. Thanks Jesus for Japanese Movies! <br /> Simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by the horror vision happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could picture in my dreams a language coming from a phone for the weekend. This time (in 31) my dreams were pleasantly wobbly inspired. <br /> In this movie the human body film of aliens whose only purpose is to try and satisfy their never ending for expensive people and blood. People become Cyborg eating meat! There's more !!! Fight Scene! Great music !! Great point-of-view shots! Dental act of the woman Siborg (at least better than her boyfriend). The battle is seen in the end worth ten or twenty times. <br /> Oh, and I've forgotten to mention it in a love story! Wow, I hate love story but this takes the cake! <br /> I can not wait to have friends over to watch this movie once more just to see the reaction on their face. Unfortunately, I took time to write this review because I'm terrified by friends and family who do not understand Machine Meatball. The truth is America as a whole not prepared for bullet machine. <br /> <br /> Lastly, my wife walked in while I was watching the climactic battle scene in the end and he was speechless. Normally saying something like "why are you watching junk?" This time he had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not junk. This is not just SPLATTER (splatter for splatter's sake is also great). This is my friend's art. Art. <br /> CHACHO
