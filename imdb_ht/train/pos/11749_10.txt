Finally we get a TV set where we get to see the acting talent! One episode was excellent! The script gave us a little bit more than usual, yes, it was always "I'm not your father -I'm your father and you're cheating on me!" garbage but the script allows actors to actually feel and live the real moments rather than show us what it would be like if - like so many TV soap. <br /> <br /> The camera work also gave us a little over normal, there was no boring vaccine to repeat the angle for hours yet there was no unnecessary vaccine 'inside the vaccine or shotgun Adding an "artistic" corner gives you what we need to see and also some nice scenery pictures as well! <br /> <br /> There was nothing that was over-dramatized or melodramatic to being real people in a real place related to real situations, the show was lacking in drama and was completely relevant. It was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented actors can be by providing a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, ten canals and all work with crew -wonderful work !! please keep what you are doing, your efforts greatly appreciate and not go unnoticed!
