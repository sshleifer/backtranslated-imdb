WARNING !!! Tons of tomorrow trips !!! NOT READY IF YOU DO NOT STAY THIS! OR you can, regardless. <br /> <br /> They are some words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and out and another; Liars, cheats, maybe even some words that can not be explained. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's death shows everyone who thought the series was old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or those who wanted the heroes (or Villian) just stopped for his final breath, , This movie was read. <br /> This movie begins with a parody of the Oz Wizard, then you see a kid who is called only as John Doe, who is the last child of Springwood, Ohio, leaves and gets out in Freddy territory. A woman who lives in a hospital / place to get the child to the type of places that meets this boy, and at the same time, have a dream about a man, a water tower, and a promise of a secret afloat in her head, go back to Springwood to figure out this scary vision, and soon find out that she is Freddy's kids, and we soon find that Freddy can only leave Springwood if her daughter can be a sort of host for her. And beyond that, great fear is. This movie looks striking the nail on the head of all you wanted to know. This film has tons of humor, and comes up with appearances, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a young stoner who sees psychopathic vision of Flowers and Iron Butterflies "In-the-Gadda- da-vida ", then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts. This movie will either make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more. Best of the best.
