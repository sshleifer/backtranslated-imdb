This was done for the crime "No Another Teenage Girl" was made for the school. I laughed all the way through as 2 bug gang wars with each other and among themselves. An unhappy comedy using bra bra and gag that kept me rolling all the way. I suppose the biggest gag in the movie all this time has never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's.
