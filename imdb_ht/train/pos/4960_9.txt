This movie is a small ray of sun in a dark winter. It celebrates a quality that is best described as ancient plain landscapes. Morgan Freeman plays a very character like Freeman himself - a successful 70-year-old actor. She traveled to a small shop, rather gloomy supermarket idea in search of a party she might play, as a manager in such a place. It's just entertainment with the customers, especially the beautiful, if angry, young woman (Paz Vega) presides over the "10 items or less" cashier line. There is a big statement to do and does not pretend that it does. He follows Freeman and Vega as they become friendly, and as the older man offers his advice, in exchange for a ride-house-movie-movie company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and Freeman has forgotten numbers her own phone so she can not call for help. I had a little bit of the blues on a Sunday afternoon grid in New York City and this cure healed to my sick.
