I know it is bullies, and I know it's not all PC, but it's so funny. If you can put it in perspective that it's from the early 80's and brings all the stereotypes of the time - and the movie always makes you almost go out and laugh - than it is really a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what the comedies was for thousands of years, the subject of this film is overestimated. If you can stop your policy regularity for an hour and a half, just have an all-out laugh, please please watch this. Would anyone please wear this out on DVD, it's hard to get on VHS again.
