Well ... easy i favorite TV series ever. Call me a clich√© walking but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drug etc. in a show and you're already getting points in my book. Combining everything with the superceeds that you've never seen on the small screen, adds directly to the movies of the old and most important type of writings that blow your head (with a few brains a time in the way), and You got yourself a show that will be very difficult to compete with. <br /> <br /> Above all stands of actor, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife's wife ... as for Gandolfini, he fits his roll in a way that words can not express, if you have not seen him as tony again see it now! <br /> I can go on and on and off on every character of the show, the psychological brilliance, the scenic incentive etc., but you might not stop me for all that I can say is that this is about The only show along with Seinfeld, that I can look over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more.
