This is one of the first and best Columbos, starting Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appears on another Columbo, similar to several other bandits, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner, and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. <br /> <br /> In this one, Ray Milland persuaded her beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, she had an affair, so she hired Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail business on the side, so it gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley and the real one if he does not pay. They get into a big fight at Culp's house, and it winds up to murder. Enter Column. <br /> Culp does everything he can to find Columbo in the case, including offering him a job, but Columbo is on him in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Excellent episode.
