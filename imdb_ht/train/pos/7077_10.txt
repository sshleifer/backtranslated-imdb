One of the ever-great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but it is outdone by Pitt to turn incredibly frenetic that in contrast to anything he did before or since. Even Stowe is not out of league here, though. The story is very coherent and offers quite a lot to think about. The climate scene is pretty much, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scene of the mental hospital is creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Many of the black humor in display here. Fantastic production design and decently bad synography. In my top ten.
