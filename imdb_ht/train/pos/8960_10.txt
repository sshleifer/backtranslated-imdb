this may not be war and peace, but the two Academy names should not be forthcoming if it was not for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I 'has fallen in love with a child and goes back in without dissatisfaction. If you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not, BB & C is a visual holiday. <br /> I do not say it to her best job, I have no experts to be sure. but looking at this movie is amazing. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the Hoo-doo oven, the retro-downtown ness; but the way he puts on film is breathtaking. <br /> I am like inconsistencies pointing out on this page above, and "special effects" that look like now. it all creates a truly consistent world.
