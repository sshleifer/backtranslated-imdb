I read the Schneebaum Book (same title as this movie) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see in many ways to "other" (its own and the people of the Amazon with whom it lived and loved) a way to live a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continued demands. His description of his sexual relationship with the men of the tribe was way ahead of his time in the early 60's, but his honesty and opening on it were welcomed. This film very well illustrates both the competition and generosity of the man, but also gives a glimpse of inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when men "civilized" intrigue traditional societies. Similarly, Schneebaum itself has moved into a higher quality of innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructive.
