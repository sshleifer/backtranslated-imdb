I was not a fan of watching this movie at all but when my gf called me, she said she had a free free screening tagged along only for seeing evora longoria and laughing at jason biggs antique. <br /> <br /> overall it was actually better then I hope but not much. This was such a hybrid in how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like the sky. a typical romantic comedy and moments I guess. The movie was quite short (though 85 minutes) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghostly haunted her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a great job of keeping up the sarcastic and ruling paul and the rest of the supporting cast (mostly jason biggs) keeping the laughs coming at a fast pace. <br /> <br /> In general I liked the movie only because it had a good number of laughs to keep me going otherwise I would give this movie a lower rating. His hey a chick flick and I reviewed this movie from a guy's perspective, it would be more of a fair fight if women reviewed this movie and he had to think about it.
