City Hall is a bit mixed mix. Vineyards in NYC's life, and moral history. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque boss and presidential dream, gives once often to dip or persevere performance. There are once couples when it chews the scenery, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where it shines. John Cusack gives a moderate and generally impeccable performance, without going through the caricatures of a New Orleans dialect, or sliding in melodrama during the movie The Climax. Danny Aiello as a torn political leader, is also very good. I love showtunes, too. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with City Hall, and it is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum. It comes more like a documentary, than a motion picture. We see the action or track the story in a peripheral perspective, and of course, the viewer does not become involved. When the viewer does not participate in a certain degree, they become indifferent towards the characters, and eventually, the plot. <br /> This tends to alienate, and what should be a fixed, detailed final finale, came as a "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say you "can not fight the city," such as breaking the crack tear away. But it still can not stop you from thinking what would be, if they just tightened up the scenario and rhythms of this movie.
