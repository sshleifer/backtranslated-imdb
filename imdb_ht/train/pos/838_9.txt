*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Filip Baker Hall. Led by Richard Shepard. A well-formulated and filmed story altogether, Brosnan was never better in a movie role outside his "Bond" cinema. After the 2004 "After the sunset" his newest role brought to the streets with a great time. Professional knock-man, so to speak, Julian Noble at a job in Mexico City winds up the exact opposite meeting on himself a high-tech businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also on the business. The duo on the screen produces a comic packed, riot laughs and it does not happen to deliver the laughter. Davis at one of her best roles since "American Splendor" has given another good and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable and best movie years. My final rating is 9/10
