Doghi is a wonderful movie with Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So, Uttara Baokar is usually excellent in most of her role. Together with Kairee, she's an example of the Marathi movies in her best. Some parts of both movies are trending in the pedagogy - it would probably reinforce the movie by having the few scenes where the social message is layered in. These scenes are probably derived from the film-maker's political anxiety but the film is realistic and move enough they do not need it. But apart from these minor quibbles, it's a movie that deserves to be seen more and one I recommend. Sumy Bhave's anxieties and the brightness of humanity.
