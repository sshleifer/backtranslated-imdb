What a fun movie ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN is lush, emotional and enchanting music, this film remains a pleasure to deserve to look more than once every year. Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! It was fascinating to look, one found himself on the man's seat corner just hanging on it every word and laughing hysterically with it. One of the most exciting characters I've come across. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending "the cute queen-hind of pork ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" He spoke of the Daffy threat and clearly heard it, Ms. Bates (played by Emma Thompson, Phyllida Law) who looks forlorn and lost. How funny that Emma would avoid Miss Gate to build herself up for one really grip-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig into her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the way to tears and just breaking one can not help but feel one heart torn out on his name. It's a classic scene, one to be rewound and played on & over ... <br /> The finish is right up with "Sense & Sensibility" and gives one of the greatest lessons of life on how one would must get married best friend one ... <br /> I hope this movie will fit you as much as I have myself. <br /> <br /> I've been worshiping it!
