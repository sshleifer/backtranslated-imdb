My husband and I love DoodleBops as much as our baby 8 months old do. We bought her the DVD and the CD just so we could look and listen to ourselves. They are fun, energetic, and very fun. Children are encouraged to be active, sharing and care. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns himself toward the TV and starts bouncing up and down in excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is bird singing. You just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
