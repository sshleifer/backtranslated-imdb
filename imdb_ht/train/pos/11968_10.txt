Full House is a great show. I still grow today on it. I started looking at her when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and always look at her. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. It is my favorite. It had such a sense of humor. In case there are people on this sight who hardly watch the show, you should because you will get hooked on it. I was hooked on it after the first show I saw, which just happened to be the first episode, in 2002. It's really a good show. I really think this show should go down to many generations of families. and it's great too because it's a proper show for all ages. and for all parents, he teaches lessons about how to go on with their lives. Nothing terrible happens, such as violence or swearing. It's just a really great sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? Oh and the best time to look it is when you are home sick at school or even the old office. It will make you feel a lot better. Believe me hardly at home sick but I always know that it will make you feel better. and everyone who thinks the show is stupid, well this is too bad for you because you will not get as far away in life even if you are happy with your life. you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it. I just tell you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this awesome show. Well I need to be going to have some lunch. Remember you must start watching full house and soon!
