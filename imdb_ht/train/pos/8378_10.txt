What a great movie it is. Nation in nations send people who fight each other with giant robots is tackling. The finish is not just a tight one, it's more inspirational. <br /> But I am intrigued by the characters. It's a pity we never saw the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and Athena's crises for Achilles's security. The Romans are very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
