This definitely is NOT the intellectual film and deepest mission, so I really do not think there is too much to understand in case you do not check. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, very funny and sometimes, maybe, little morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý) so the authors. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and the two films should not be compared in that way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and some luck he will succeed. <br /> No bad movie, not the smart one, but I loved it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
