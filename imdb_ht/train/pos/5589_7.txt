Flush with symbols and full of beautiful movies, extract is so much more than the erotic drama we all came to expect. This is almost a silent film, with which dialogue there is in German, and very simplified German in this. Perhaps the filmmakers intend the movie to reach the wider possible European audience, as anyone with even a slightly high level German high school can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, and the movie succeeds on a cinematic level, not one narrative. The symbol of fertility and the power of nature overwhelming the human character - there are even scenes where dark-colored figures are supposed to be stars Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments here that will remind viewers of their work at Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the movie has any message to transmit, I think it's a single policy: bourgeois people are timid and important; working class people is a happy, creative productive; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she made a child. This mixture of Socialist Socialist Socialist and Dogmatic Socialist Socialists does not cover the film by any means - it's a beauty to look from the beginning to end - but it does put it in a very different artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get his kit.
