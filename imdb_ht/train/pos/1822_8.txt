An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of Nimh and the Land before time, this was a very touched romantic touch. I remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well it starts out a bit black, a dog that escaped from the book, and comes to kill an old friend, ending in the sky, and returns. But it gets sweet when it befriends an orphan girl who can talk to the animals. Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other designs, such as the sequel to Charlie's dream, but everything else was okay, and the songs were just. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, ahehehe. With Judith Barsi de Jaws Revenge, let God rest his soul, poor girl, he did not deserve to die, but he is in the sky now, all good people go to heaven. Overall this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to be animated with Disney shame. Recommended for the whole family. And knowing this, if you have the original video of this, you will find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, having to love that guy, ahehehe.
