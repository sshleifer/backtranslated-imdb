I just saw this movie on TV .. <br /> I lost my dad when I was young and this movie surely touched me .. <br /> I can feel the loss of the girl's Desi feel .. <br /> the feeling of wanting to see his father again .. <br /> want to talk to him .. <br /> or at least give the chance to say goodbye .. <br /> and I'm so touched and The letter was written back to her .. <br /> she said her father read her letter, and sent her back to someone to answer her and buy her a present because there's not a store in the sky .. <br /> it just lets me feel that miracles exist ..
