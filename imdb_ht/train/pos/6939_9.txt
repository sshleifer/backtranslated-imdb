I was very impressed with this movie. I should miss it as one of Europe's earliest era. I say that for everything: acting, mature dialogues, nonsense stories and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who did several movie noir films around the same era, also did some west as this one. She had the same movie-noir look. Man and Jimmy Stewart collaborate on the west during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend to the River." In a nutshell, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam," (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he has just-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed over from the cruel villains. All of these villains are interesting characters. Help Stewart act in such exciting stories as Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson play an American ("Young Bull"), but you can not have everything.
