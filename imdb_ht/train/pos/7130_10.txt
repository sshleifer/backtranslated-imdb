Well, when I first saw this movie I really did not know whether it might be mine was ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best films I've been looking for for a very long time, a real classic family. The story of a young and new 'foster' father evoked, this movie ticks all the boxes. I have not read the book (maybe that's a good thing and meant I enjoyed the movie more) but with regard to the story, I really can not think of any bad points, hence making it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything guaranteed top brand!). By the time William was proclaimed 'I can ride my bike, DAD!' I was sobbing my heart out (anyone who sees it will understand, I'm sure). Really heart, and definitely recommend.
