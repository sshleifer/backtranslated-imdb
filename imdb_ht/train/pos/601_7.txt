I was amazed at the low rated movie that was given by the viewers. I saw her a late night on TV and she hit the spot - I actually thought she was back in 1989 when she first appeared. But I remember it very well, with a nice twist or two, with an exciting ambiance on a Windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks decently robust for his role as the sumptuous sum of the unfulfilled promise early in his career, and everyone else plays it very straight forward. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the terms, which might have seemed somewhat disrupted in 1989, may now seem to tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "edginess" is often just used as a The necessary marketing tools, sort of such ads just get noticed.
