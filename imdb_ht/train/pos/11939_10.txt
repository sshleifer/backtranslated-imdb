I was always like this great baseball movie! She has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film is Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza, and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and acts throughout the movie actor! Baseball scenes are all realistic! The music by composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits the movie very well! Some of the actors remind me of the current baseball characters. Stoney Jackson at Ray Mitchell character reminded me Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders commentator in my opinion would say how Al Hrabosky looks today. This is a fantastic movie for those who are not with Baseball fans and I recommend this movie!
