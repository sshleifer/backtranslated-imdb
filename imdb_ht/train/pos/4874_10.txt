Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laugh and laugh, what a party! The music is widespread, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy cats, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, everything colorfully visual to entertain only. Most movies in the sense. A wonderful experience to watch. And one is especially grateful when good comedies are so rare, and so wonderful. Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed the previous movie Kusturica, you'll love this, although, as in all comedies, it's about a chemical reaction and you have to do in the mood for it.
