I can not tell you how much I love this film. I have read reviews that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete". I say that these reviews have no imagination! For anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever like to play Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you, (especially if you've got to the Oriental Adventures) I'm just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. :-)
