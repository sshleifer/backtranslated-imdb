Oh, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about the theory that we all are linked by someone. If focus on living a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of this show, she did not keep my attention to all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then I saw some episodes ... and she liked it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different to each other. There's an addiction alcohol, a woman with fraud cheats on her, a woman who just loses her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... Unlike what we are using, most of the characters communicate with each other in accident, as in our daily routine. Great! My favorite ones are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. Then throw in. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", shows here the ability to act her in a more 3D character than before her work as Paxton. Other are also given great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the ratings low. <br /> It's too bad it did not have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
