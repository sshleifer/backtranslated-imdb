"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and has been plain and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. And it does not mean a tearjerker. But I mean that in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how they have been afflicted with AIDS that affect their daily life quality. It's almost hard to say whether this was a kind of movie or not, because it was so discouraging that I had to look for other ways to respond. It is an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable documents, sincere I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It does Hollow-wood production on AIDS looks like hip and heartless. These guys made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You're my Sunshine" Mark and tell her goodbye is the real thing.
