Look back over the past 28 years (since my first exposure show), all I can say is: Once you find it-it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) annoyingly overacted, 2) under product 3) unlikeable character <br /> Well, two years later I watched some bouts again and found it almost as annoying. A year later I was able to catch the whole series from the beginning and quickly became pushed into the bittersweet story of human fault and perspective on happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the production value of the date would be difficult to cope with now. But I still think about the show at least once a month and a tear waves are longing for what seemed like the simplest times ... <br /> My btw is a married man ... (for everyone who thinks this is a show for the women)
