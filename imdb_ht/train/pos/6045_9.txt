I was in the movie too, but I do not know if they actually put this scene in. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they did the movie, and we asked (all of us) to run in and call Go! Freebird! We were all around 10 years old, could anyone watch the movie tell me if this party was caught in the movie, it might be great to know! I remember I thought the film was never out, because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released. All in your comments seem to be good so I guess it was quite a successful movie, I might buy it, but first I would like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
