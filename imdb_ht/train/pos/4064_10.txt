I have never met one person (from hundreds) who hated this movie. Package that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur, or a victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself: "Are you a fan ...?" Then go see "Laputa". <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this one rank among my top five. And I saw a lot of movies.
