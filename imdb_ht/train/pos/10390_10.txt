Next "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz," this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a true shame it's not as well-known as the ancient films (perhaps because it sticks to a legend based story rather than contemporary or sci-fi environment, and that it's British, meaning a smaller market for film), but its wonderful know that it deserves reputation. Like all great family films, one can be a kid, an adult, or even a teenager enjoying this movie (I currently 18), but one must appreciate the classic movie first. I absolutely adore this movie. He has an extraordinary musical score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film scores) that rivals any Williams Star Wars, a fast but not flashy pace, nice set, dialogue, and the use of colors (both together with symphony was Oscars), and the state-of-the-art Oscar-have special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). And, of course, the hot Dupont Jen Duprez looks like Princess Rival in Catherine Zeta-Jones' (he even looks like Jones in a way!). <br /> In conclusion, this is one of the all-time favorite films (next to the "Adventures of Robin Hood") and it really deserves more attention. It's a true adventure of enchantment at all and, along with "Robin Hood," it's my desert island movie that I could look over and over again without getting annoyed. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
