This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frames from artists all over the world. Documents vary and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing that they shared was 9/11 as a term (very minor in some cases). Some of the shepherds are weak while others are very strong; Some are politics, some are not; Some are just about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a touching theme on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been monitored in any fashion by anyone to think that you see them are very rare and powerful. This is a very controversial movie, especially for American Conservative. I think that two segments could really tick on their right-wing (one in Egypt where a U.S. dead soldier and a Bombon bombing bomb came back as a demon; another from UK that recounts reverse US-backed in Chile on Sept. 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and terrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was more powerful, telling the fall of the towers and the resulting death in living mode (you have to see it to believe it). Even if the final product is uneven, and some segments were almost "pointless", I always recommend this. It is very difficult to sort this movie because the segments vary everywhere (some weak, some powerful;). I give this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually have to be controlled (segment Mexico, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
