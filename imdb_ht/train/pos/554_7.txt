(there is little disgust) <br /> It's interesting as Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra in "It's a nice life", so it's easy to find the parallel between these two films. In "It's a nice life", Bailey came to see the world as it would have been if she had never been born. In the "Far West", Webster Stewart Stewart does not get involved with helping anyone else (except himself), to see the same thing: A world in which he (for all practical matters) does not exist. / / <br /> Not getting involved (and trying not to care for anyone), Webster forced to see those for whom it can not help but take care of the pain, push around, and even kill while that he stands in and does nothing. This recalls the viewer of George Bailey watching a world that has turned head-down because he also decided not to participate in never been born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end up with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell. Stewart, by turning his philosophy into non-participation, he was, it would seem, touch his "wings".
