Ah, the 1970s. A time when he was in to be a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but it just felt more daring then. Joe Sarno offers up a very good soft-core film. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a draw and character development. It is pretty much what you would expect from a swing movie. Two married couples openly re-ignite the outside of the milf of one of the women who came for a visit. Not much of it. <br /> Of course, when the milf is Jennifer Welles then it's a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as tasty desperate as Ms. Welles. It's worth the price alone to see Ms. Welles look at himself in the mirror as if it's Aphrodite. She has no "Mother Stifler". It is sexual way. <br /> I also dug Anna Chris in the Jordan. Jordan resembles many sounds like Elaine Joyce that I thought he might read "separate from birth" to twin or even Elaine himself. Anna is still eating, but she must have incredible metabolism. Like the 1990 Soft-core porn, the softie 70's porn was caught up to the hardcore movie realism (something the 2000-year-old stuff brought on the occasion rather than 90 music and box orgasms) and is here in full force. It's not real but it feels real. <br /> For those who have enjoyed the Quebec that produced "Two Girls Who Were Os", you will enjoy this one. Another classic movie on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 can be one month you can pass.
