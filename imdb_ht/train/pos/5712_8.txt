This is one irresistible big-happy and technically very filmed movie! The movie features some of the older insights you'll ever see in a movie '30, though it's all too clear that they lie, rather than real location locations. Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressively, the whole set would obviously move. The best moments in the film were silent, more old fashioned, slapstick quality moments. It shows that René Clair's heart was silent to make films. Humor in general is really great in this movie. Also of course the musical moments were more than big. This is a really enjoyable and simple early French music. Even though the best moments are silent moments, this does not mean that the film is not filled with some great funny dialogues, which are very well released to the main actors, which all seemed like my stage actors, in which case This has worked very well for the movie in its overall style and beautiful no-anxiety atmosphere. No wonder this worked out well, since this film is actually based on playing by Georges Berr. It's a really great movie movie, and also some great camera-work innovations in it and some really great editing, which create some quick going and nice to watch the enjoyable sequences. Never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart director, who knew how to construct and comic moments in movies. It's a very creative movie to make, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel like a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, which never seizes entertainment. <br /> <br /> Last last hour is especially fun unforgettable, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as the most creative moments of comedy comedy comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, which of course are all very stereotyped and funny and they are obviously dropping because they seem. It all adds to the wonderful beautiful humorous atmosphere and incite of the movie. <br /> One of the most beautiful movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
