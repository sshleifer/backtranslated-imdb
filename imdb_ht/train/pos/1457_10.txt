I watched this documentary twice - and although I'm a bigger movie film, most documentaries do not keep my attention. This film however was fascinating. Nearly every shot is perfect - it says more than an audio comment (which does not have this documentary). This concept is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras pearl - who would think? Amazing and excellent choices in interview - footage of a factory in China - the movie makes you feel like you are actually there. <br /> I'm aware of politics - and I read several books about globalization so there was nothing in this movie that was a surprise to me. However, it made me think so much. I would also like a lot, that this world was a better place. <br /> One million kudos in the movie theater - and thanks for making this movie too. <br /> <I wish everyone could see it.
