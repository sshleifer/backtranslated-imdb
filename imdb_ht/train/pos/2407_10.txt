The first time I saw this film, I loved it. It was different. <br /> I am a Christian (Bible believes). I do not go along with the crowds of right-wing believers. I dropped out of this atmosphere. <br /> For me in the attempts to take on our government are doing what Judas tried to do. I call him Judas Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not find it, though Jesus said that His kingdom was not in this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed some of that. I also liked that Jesus liked the simple fun of playing games with jokes and his followers. <br /> <br /> Also it was a very gorgeous Jesus. It's a look-on and film. <br /> <br /> Very satisfied.
