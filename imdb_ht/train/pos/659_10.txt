One of the last classic of the French New Wave. For directions, Cineaste Jean Eustache drew out of simplicity in early cinema of centuries; For history, Eustache drew on the torments of his own life complicated love. So many things can be said in this movie - observantly brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally poured ... etc. etc. In my mind, whatever complaints that can be brought against this movie are easily overshadowed by its many forces. Every student film, writer, or simply anyone who wants to handle a 3-hour movie with no abrupt cuts, there is no overstyling video music, no soap opera-like twisting draw, and no ordinary dialogue must make it a point to see this movie. All things must be admired: the writing (short, smart, amazing funny), acting (everyone, simply, is perfect in their respective roles), and simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the movie ) to make this unforgettable film. This is undoubtedly a movie left with you.
