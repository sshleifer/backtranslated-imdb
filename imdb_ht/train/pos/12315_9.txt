There are 21 comments I add to this list and there is barely a criticism. This is because this movie is terrific entertainment and it has a bit of everything in it. It is perhaps a little scary for younger children but my 15-year-old son thought he was fantastic in every way out of action, in the humor and even the nice music note. <br /> I buy DVD only when I know that they will regularly watch and now that this is finally available in the UK, I will certainly be adding it to my collection.
