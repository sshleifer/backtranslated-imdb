This is one of those unique horror films that require a more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated. The main thing that people can fail to realize is that this story is said to be a boy's point of view, and, like most younger children, it becomes fearless. Mostly because he simply does not understand things, such as why his father is hardly the leg for him. From watching the movie you can see the husband discussing his wife balance between working time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the boy does not. Also one can imagine the boy being scared of the woods, as he established early in the movie, that the family is out of the city. Also, at the beginning as the family is traveling to the house to hit a deer, then get held, then to discuss with the locals about it, and the little boy surely did not get this introduction into the beautiful woods at all. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" is finally what his youth, innocent minds are inventing to explain all of this. There is Indian Indian legend, but when looking at the scene where the boy hears about it, he is explaining it as sudden and simplistic. Not because that's Wendigo's actually is, but because it's like he understands it. When you look at this movie from the point of view you can really start to appreciate it. Obviously it was low-budget and inexpensive injection, but the montages jump, use light, and general generation more than make up for it. And the final question the movie asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> Rated R: profanity, violence, and a sex scene
