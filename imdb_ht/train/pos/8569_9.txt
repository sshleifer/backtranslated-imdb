This is just as good as the 101 original if not the best. Of course, Cruella steals the show with his outrageous behavior and teamwork, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more in this round of time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, rather bumbling the male lead. To use Paris as the highest point the movie was a smart idea. The movie is well worth the look of your age, giving you the like.
