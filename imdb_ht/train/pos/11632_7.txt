Greet again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is actually thrilling! New "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "Notebook") dominates screen time in this cute little funny suspense suspicion of renowned film director Wes Craven ("Movies" cinema and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" ). Craven even has a comet as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this one job is realism in the first 15-20 minutes as we see McAdams interacting with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. It is a natural one. When it meets Cillian Murphy (the episode of "Batman start") of what appears to be to happen, the film really flew. Watching the yuppie-type little game while the audience knows a bad thing is brewing, it's the kind of movie-making! The rising sequence board is fascinating with the further 30 minutes onboard excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing as the involvement of others and if someone comes to his rescue. As with so much subtleties, the disappointment only occurs during the climax when the lamb becomes a superhero. An exciting draw device leads us to believe Rachel has the paints needed to frustrate this view, but we can not help but cringe a bit. The most exaggerated scenes involve riotous hotel invasions, an annoying airliner passenger, the Cillian crash and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological game between the drives. Unfortunately the Brian Cox veteran screen is under-utilized, but in general this is a high-end suspension suspension worth seeing for all but the final.
