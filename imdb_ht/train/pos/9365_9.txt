I saw this in a screening last night too. I was totally blown to how much this film was happening. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current drama events and have not fallen apart from the conclusion. <br /> I will not bother rehashing the plot too much because I think less you know about this movie will make it the best. But I'll say that Adam Sandler's performance was really worthwhile and real. It was funny, and very funnier than most of his most recent comedies. Don Cheadle was credible as always. This movie is not funny as Borat or Billy Madison but it has a fast pace on it. I would say 90% of the street audience for most of the movie. Midway in the movie slows down to the end of the drama of things and does a really nice job to tie it all together. <br /> I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up all friends of black / white friends things they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
