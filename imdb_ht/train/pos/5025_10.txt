Man, some of us people were in cold weather. This film was artistic. Instead of seeking reasoning or message to justify it in your reality, why not understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of the people here are trying to film critics - and they're not doing well. I'm so impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton in the direction, that I'll contact him personally to tell him. Well, if you did not try to analyze the heck from the possibility of the story line, you might just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends have done!
