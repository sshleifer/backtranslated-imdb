Clark Gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard-boiled Dame Jean Harlow. She tries to suck her while she brushes her off with her hard-hitting attitude. Despite their cynicism and disadvantages, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally killed a man during a sting he ran out of Harlow loyal to women's prison where he discovered her in pregnancy. Anita Loos 'and Howard Emmett Rogers' writings are excellent in all the characters that are drawn and surprised (including a Jewish prisoner of socialist woman and a black woman prisoner and her father preaches and hardly a trace of stereotypes). Gable and Harlow show their masters as actors add added nuances and curious characters to their sentence beyond the typical Gable and Harlow Roles. With the direction better than you would expect from Sam Wood. A nice shot was Harlow being told in the prison, then headed out of an amazing snow lake as the tracks cameras after her. This is one of the best of both the "criminals of love" and "women in jail" genres and some of the best-hard-boiled dialogue ever written.
