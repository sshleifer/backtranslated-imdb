I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme, found it touching and tender. It is not for someone who has an idea-reality as it is full of fantasy and beautiful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I only saw him in the rumor of the Long, warm summer where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes everywhere, as Hank considers things that happened to him, were beautiful and sensitive. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and pretty as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was superb and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including one in which Hank realized that Max really was in his life. It's not for everyone ..... especially those who are not in 'feel-good' movies and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. But I think it is well worth to re-watching, which is why I've stuck it. (Yes, some of us still have VCR. :)
