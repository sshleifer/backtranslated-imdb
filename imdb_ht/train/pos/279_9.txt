I love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your chair while playing it. The way the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit, very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that just a game and you are not really there. Sound effects and audio are amazing. There are a lot of weapons and different spells to throw and you can even choose which spells do stronger or not. You get this stone that can hit back enemies while you recover your enemy mons explosion and even more magical. The best part is that the whole time you play it you are really jumping and scared for what might persist around the next corner or what might jump out behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try to play it with phone head over.
