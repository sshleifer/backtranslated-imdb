Going for something far out of spitey stuff that she usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the glamorous world / art. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a teenager working in the Baltimore class who loves photographing things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovered his job, he offered great breaks, which he accepted. But once he hit it big, he has reconsidered everything. Basically, "Pecker" looks at how she lost her friendship with her normal life once she became a celebrity. The sort of thing that we might expect, sure, but with Waters directed, there's always something a bit of shock (you'll know when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also begins Christina Ricci, Mink stole with Patty Hearst.
