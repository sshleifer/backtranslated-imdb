Throw perfect for a drama-some people. Simon who died but somehow rose from the outside. What he saw has appeared in empty orchestr spot shape at a magnificent score in German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of the dead he would see on the other side. Her girlfriend tried to keep her in life but failing, she decided to follow her after her death finally came. Very touch and move, deeply psychological, but somewhat slow and somewhat boring.
