Eddie Izzard is the genius and humor that does not stop it. I could listen all day long. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His knowledge of discovery (such as the Heimlich maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laugh that hard in your mind off-beat.
