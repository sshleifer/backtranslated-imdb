This is one of my favorites along with Marleyte Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and the Moors-and-Small Spacemen episodes. <br /> It is an important take away, from the middle of 1961, over the Cold War long as the US was then impeding the beaten down-down city-scene, the sparse diameter characters are near-dying, uniform The filters, and the action is minimal "say" it all: the absurdity of a subconscious conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that sweet and crippling about it. It is a "fairytale" because it did at a time in which, the events had turned out Similarly, like the second Berlin crisis (Spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban missile crisis (October 1962), it would actually have been a reasonable representation of one of the largest United States, lost and filled with some miserable survivors. I see it as a "fairytale" because it is not just a caution, but because it is the most reminiscent of all our popular myths: it is a love story, put in an impossible situation, and involving two lovers very mismatched.
