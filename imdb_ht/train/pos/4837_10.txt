I was a young filmmaker in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Rhinoes became Sofia Bulgaria and Premiere Konchalovsky "Siberiade"; Tarkosvky in "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberias" 4 and 1/2 hour epic and he spoke. Way better then Bertolucci's "1900". Not far away! <br /> <br /> Expect Andron will somehow find the negative and make "restore to restore the full version" one day! On DVD of course! Also I fiercely fighting in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equal to the Soviet film and bad taste! Time is on my side.
