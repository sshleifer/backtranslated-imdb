Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just look for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it has some laugh-out-loud moments. This is a movie you look when you need to eat for thought. <br /> <br /> To postpone this movie as simple racist is to miss the point entirely. This is not just a satire in the South Song, it's also a book biting on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group presented in the movie shows them as the grotesque cartoon of the stereotypes, which in turn are caricatures of the real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the cinema shows just how absurd these tough beliefs are really. <br /> <br /> If you are the sort of person who wants to recognize the reluctance of the prevalent prevalence of American culture still hold, and if you are not afraid to watch your own prey in the eye, this movie can be yours.
