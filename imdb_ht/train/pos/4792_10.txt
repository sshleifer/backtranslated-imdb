The right story is a multiplayer exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. At one level a slow walk in the heartland, it is quality people, with yellow grains, to another level of growing old and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that many can say silently. A remarkable movie that will rest quietly with me for some time to come.
