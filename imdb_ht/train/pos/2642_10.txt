Surely this is a 'heart-heated' movie. It was the George Peobody award, winning on "Root", so that can tell you something in this movie. I am looking for the Internet how to order this movie since my former father in law, Eugene Logan, co-writer this movie has been dead for a few years now so I have no opportunity to receive information from him. I would like to have only his daughter, my daughter, see this movie, as well as to pass this wonderful story about his big-son. My oldest daughter was seven years old at the time he had been exposed on television and I was looking forward to seeing him again. One of my friends said he was his favorite movie. I will not 'spoil' this movie for you.
