This is a short, brass animated by David Lynch (as it says from the beginning), and follows the misadventures of a weed, in general-wearing big man, and a wife with a stress disorder and a baby men annoying. Both of these elements are being detained over repeated in the short episodes, and no real plot to be seen. It's easier if you think of this as an odd exceptionally, a little tricky Looney Tunes - with more gore, profanity, blood violence, and occasional moments of hilarity. <br /> I bought the DVD along with Eraserhead, having previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - this is nothing but. In fact, it seems almost there is a statement against things, as its rough style features in dealing with any sort of animation convention you can see. As Lynch says, "If this is funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of it all."
