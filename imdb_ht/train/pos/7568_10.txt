I saw this my last day at the festival, and it was my pleasure to stick around extra couples in the day. Poetic, moving, and most amazing, funny, in its own strange way. It is so rare to see the director working in this style that can be found true to strangess and humor in a too-realistic world, without seeming precious, or troubling the balance. Manage looks like both, but completely controlled. I am reluctant to make comparisons, because these filmmakers really have their influence influenced (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like the modern director of this tradition ( Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you are in for a real treat. This is a wonderful movie, and I hope more people get to see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
