I loved this movie so much because it is a true true story of the Amazon, part of the world that still has my intrigue. I believe a condensed form of the book was published in the "Digest Reader" soon after the current event was held. <br /> Because I'm a "baby bomber," the character and the actress is my contemporary, and for this reason I am related to the movie. I also believe the film is invaluable to teach coping skills if the viewer observes these characters in the streams that lead to the river and coastal coastline where it can get help, as well as other surviving techniques. The most important wanted him to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope the spectators learn something from it, in addition to seeing it for entertainment. <br /> I wish the movie should be released in VHS and DVD soon as I would like to add it to my video collection. It should also show more often about the movies.
