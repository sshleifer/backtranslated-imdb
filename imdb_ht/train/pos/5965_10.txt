I gave this a 10 out of 10 points. I love it very much. I'm a child of 80s and totally heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons I like this movie very much. So cool to see these posters in the room of that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and her vinyl collection (Evil Injury by Exciter, Rise of the Mutants by Shock metal meter impaler and killing is my business by Megadeth). Also the band by FASTWAY is totally incredible and fits perfectly with the scheme. If you are in metal, then TRICK or draw is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or genre SIMMONS because of the movie for a second, watch it because the band and the story will take you back to the 80s glory. You will not even be the next person.
