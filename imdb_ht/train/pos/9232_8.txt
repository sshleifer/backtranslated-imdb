Asked why women are relegating the high role in the best of life as in holy scripture, it is confronted in the manner that male domination can break the lives of women, insulting riots fueled by ranting of semi-dig older Sister Agatha (indelibly described by actress veteran Maria Casarès from LES ENFANTS Marcel Carné DU PARADIS) and - more constructive - not a Muslim invasion.
