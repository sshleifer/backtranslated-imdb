Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad movie. But he failed to take the taste and the horror of the 1963 film at the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he still is, and most of the cast keeps up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right to feel the character of Luke. But the biggest fault with this version is that she lost so far the story of Shirley Jackson in her attempt to be breathtaking and losing some of the thrill of the movie earlier in a cutting trade for special snazzier effects. Again I will say that in and in itself it is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction fright of the older version more.
