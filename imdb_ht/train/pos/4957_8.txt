10 PROBLEMS or less made in two weeks on a budget touched by writer / director Brad Silberling, just a little movie shot in Carson, CA that feels like the whole story was etc ... in the best sense of mo a. Silberling had good luck to fear veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between its major projects, and Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages that manage to improve the life of the other. <br /> Morgan Freeman plays herself - yet part of the comedy is that she is portraying as an actor who has been out of work for four years, calculating a place for a little 'filler filler' to get back to the sink these. His role is to be that of a market manager and it's falling in marketplace seduced at Carson where he encounters, among others, one red, the girl in the article 10 discussions or less cashier lines. Not only is hey red at his static work, he is also generally angry about his filandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), now Sleeping and Laughing the Scarlet College (Anne Dudek), and his lack of ability to get a work decently elsewhere. The pair after some sharing issues and cuts are going on a 'road trip' that results in each of the growing characters in the presence and life stories of the other. <br /> It's a simple story, simply said, but because of the tender bond between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships that were vulnerable to changing and exchanging the message. It is well worth the look, and this is a DVD with featurettes that are touching, informative, and funny - a fun view. Grady Harp
