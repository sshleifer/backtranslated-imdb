This film Batman is not quite as good as the Batman mask in the fantasy and Batman and gentleman subzero but it's still a good slice of the Batman cartoons that it is equally good as Batman Beyond the movie. This film is good for all the same reason the storyline is good not quite as good as one of the other but still very good it has lots of action in it Effect of the Good Drawing Voice of the Actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbara Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The bandits are good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with mystery batteries in the Batwomen. So be sure to rent or buy mystery batman in the movie Batwoman because it is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall note: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
