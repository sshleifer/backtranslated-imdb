This movie is so great. He put back at probably 40's and Meg Ryan's character to be known as 'smart.' Plus Tim Robbins is so beautiful in this movie. And everything about it has a magical sentiment towards it. Every time I look it I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I love it. I love the music too. The violin is scary. but besides that I think it's a nice story and everyone should watch it.
