This is a brilliant sci-fi film that is very unusual in how men and women both see the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie and almost every guy liked it, saying it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just lousy and stupid! This is the only movie I know of whose polarized views are based on gender. Maybe many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing schemes - but whatever the cause, I have always found the fascinating difference. The movie begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future with the head of the major international Soylent Corporation being murdered. As the movie unfolds, you quickly realize this is a terrible American society that is terrible and very inevitable. The rich live in gorgeous apartment with security and all the fun money can be purchased (including "furniture" - an euphemism for paying mistress that comes along with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor dust, work and in many cases living in abandoned car or apartment halls. Overpopulation and smog have taken a serious phone number and the next seems awful! <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth he could not live with me really should be discussing - he could ruin the movie for you. However, the movie has a great draw and act and is super-interesting to watch. Plus, he presented Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the sidewalk crushed Heston. Even if not for easy depression or chic, this is a great sci-fi movie which is allegorical and profound.
