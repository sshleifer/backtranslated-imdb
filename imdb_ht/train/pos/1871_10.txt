I was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the problem the fisherman was in the movie but I still shared some of the emotions and this film really helped bring them out and force me to deal with them. It even caused me to realize that I had a "missing piece" and I'm going to look for my parents' birth right now. I called for almost a day later I saw this the first time. The Confrontation Confronted with his birth motherboard juxtaposes and his father's family reaction to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our birth parents.

No matter if you are adopted or not, it's a heart-tugger that can not be ignored by any person concerned about our society.
