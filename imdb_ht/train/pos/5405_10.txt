Brothers, I have Pokémon 4Ever on DVD. We watched it as a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad it was a new Pokémon did not talk this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> The Iron Mask Maker was nicer to mean when he captured Celebi with his black ball. Good things Ash and Sam controls to snap it out of control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song of credit to end Cele-Brate's call made by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever Become a Success Since the previous three films and people are still enjoying that movie.
