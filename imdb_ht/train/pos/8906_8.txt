Some of these guys are watching movies and complaining about them for a living to forget something: DVD menu system. I tell you the people, I look at the main screen in this one over 35 times. He was scared. A cinematic carpet of bright waterfall came from where it was, which began in much. Often the sum and Bam! I was hooked. Over and over and over. And over. <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And that's just the soundtrack! <br /> I'm set aside in the bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and soft evening is again soft. The cat is comfortable with my ankle that meets me, is already resting. I popped into the DVD. I was fascinating. Through the night. "Do not go out, the doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> The pate. See it. Steve Queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs way up!
