This movie is a classic that should be. It's not quite, certainly. The rally, while perfect for the stage, is in film form slowing as a turtle and arthritic knee. Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. It fully displays talent enough talent, skill, and compelling craft to play intelligent, passionate, and confident Joan, but, unfortunately, the director misses the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite author. In no other play the dialogue was more sharp, nor the more musical lines. However, this film process requires you to look into it as an attorney. This movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. This is how this picture is to be enjoyed. 7/10.
