This is my first review of IMDb, I did not really want to write one, but since there are only 2 for this great movie now, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not associated movie maker in any way (yes yes how many times you are here before ;-)) my fii in my late 20s <br /> 1st in all i have to admit i really love anime movies because what you see is limited by The imagination of the creators and was very imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of history but to succeed a very unique and imo cool visual style. The characters look good, but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairy-like world. But the origins and the world in general are full of awesome visuals that my jaws have dropped several times while watching this. Blue, bunny-like mini-dragon shows the show and has readily some of the funniest times in the movie, he is already an instant classic, much like scrat from ice age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-hero has to go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but that cares if the movie looks like that sounds good ;-) 1 thing I have in Point out, imo movie does not fit for very small children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe scary for kids under 6-8 I might say, these are just very few scenes but worth mentioning emo. Anyway, I had a great time watching this and can not wait to hit the stores in the high challenge to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.
