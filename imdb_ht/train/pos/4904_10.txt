Spacious in any way, this movie is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good. If you like jazz music, it's a must see. If you enjoy seeing the love character that makes you smile, can bring a tear in your eyes and swing like no tomorrow this movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy art pieces to dissected and analyzed perhaps you better stick with something by Darren Aronofsky (in other words - djjohn reviewer up, you do not know a good time when you see one!) My only complaint is that the movie was just too short. I guess I'll just have to look it several times more to get my filling.
