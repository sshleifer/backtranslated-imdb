It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but this man is funny. Cline and Garden are great. (He launches the line "God, you are so lousy" as he climbs into his window - great! Kline runs into the door after Skoping out Teri Hatcher - great too!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together perfectly - Until he finds out that he really is ... a soap opera turns out to be every one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the end of the Chinese food area has my kids and I rolled off the floor - which alone is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Do not solve any world issues or show the underbelly torture on daylight TVs (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
