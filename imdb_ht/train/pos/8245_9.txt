Even without saying a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "mother"?, Even better. Friendfriends girlfriends <br /> <br /> "... my dad to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> And I thought Dawn of the dead was good. It's kind of like aircraft to meet (meat?) Night of the living dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> And do not forget my coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just way cool! <br /> And yes, the social comment is just too much to start commenting on. <br /> <br /> Sufice it means, it's all really working!
