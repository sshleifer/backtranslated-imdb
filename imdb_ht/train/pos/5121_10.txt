I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reason. I think Travolta and Winger do at higher than average rates, I think that lying was representative of the place and the era, I loved the sound track with the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed at the current club and Gilley had low ceiling - maybe 10-12 feet high, and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" was hanging 2-4 feet under the ceiling. The camera managed to get shots in the smoke and focus on the actors, the calf, the bar, women, the dance, low-level light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Be sure to have an auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it must be low-light vaccine. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was outstanding! She had some shots she had no hope of achieving and the impact they had brought a sense of reality to the movie. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
