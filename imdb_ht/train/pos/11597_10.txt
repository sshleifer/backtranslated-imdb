I read many comments that I, too, shared on reminding this movie and wanting to seriously see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, because of doing a research and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realize that this movie was in my mind. I then did a research and did get the movie and were so happy to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and so I want to thank all of you. I want to share how I could get this movie for everyone who was looking for a copy too. It was about the WMS version of the Wonderful World of Disney's "Called Courage" containing 2 cinemas, the second one being "legendary of the boy and the Eagle." She touched me now as much as he did 40 years ago and now I own my own copy of it. I think it is available only on VHS. I found it on eBay and I saw several copies of it. Enjoy it, I know I did! <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and eagle she was taking care of. When it was time to kill the eagle, the boy set the eagle free because he could not allow it to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after the eagle's release, the eagle, too, saved the boy's life and more than that, teach him how to survive. Closure that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert were so moving and filming was really remarkable. What a wonderful era was this. I never saw anything coming even close to this movie!
