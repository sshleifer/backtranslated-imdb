For me a matter of life and death is just that - simply the best movie ever to do. <br /> Since starting at the end of the classroom. It is interesting, intriguing thought, a world war of war post and the relationship between people. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning with the effect of combining monochromatic and technicolor accent their world of different transparency work. The characters and scheme development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a well-credited fantasy. <br /> No matter how many times I watched the movie - and I watched it so much - it never failed to touch me. She makes me smile, she makes me laugh, she makes me think and makes me cry. It is as cool today as it was in 1946. <br /> If I allowed just one movie to keep and look again A matter of life and death would be that movie.
