I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the bandits were interesting in their role and the unknown bands created an interesting "guess" game. The movie, however, needs more Robin in it. She has appeared in the movie from the beginning and occasionally throughout the movie. I still think the new animated series did little justice to the character of his own new Robin, let alone Knightwing. This movie just continues that bad tradition. The movie spent too much time on Bruce Wayne and her romance that would not be so bad in a movie if the romance was not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.
