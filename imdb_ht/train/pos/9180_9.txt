I felt duty bound to watch 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of "Jane Eyre," because I would just write an article on the BBC 2006 "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. So I approach watching this way I would approach doing homework. <br /> I was irritable at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everybody / everything is washed out in a clear light shining light, in some scenes, shadow drawers on the wall behind the characters. <br /> And the sound is incorrectly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a high school game. <br /> <br /> And the make-up panc is way too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. They are too fierce, too Martha Stewart. I just can not see Rochester Bronte related to Martha Stewart's domestic arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester has lived in such a sizeable cave, very suitable for the Roman Gothic mood. But ... and all those objections ... not only is this the best "Jane Eyre" i I've seen, it can be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. This "Jane Eyre," in spite of its technical flaws, brought the feeling back to me in reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. The critics of this production say it's too close to the book. For me, someone who values ​​the book and did not need it to be any less "wordy" or any less "Christian" or any more sex up, faithful version of the novel broun are actually written its best advantage. > <br /> Bronte wrote a good darling book. There is a reason that it lasted 150 years more, while others, slickers, sexier and easier texts, disappeared. <br /> As a "Jane Eyre" fan, I was preyed against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famously, not nice; Jane and Rochester are the most popular couple of ugly literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if it's not stunningly beautiful. But Dalton gives a fascinating performance as Rochester. It just blows me away. I have never seen anything like his complete devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and Rochester's love for Jane. Dalton brings the Rochester page to make life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester stands for a bit scary. Dalton is awesome. Welles got the scary track down, too, for example, when he spoke "enough!" After Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scared more than once, here. You really can not say if he's going to hurt Jane, or herself, to his deportation. <br /> <br /> Rochester's uncle, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton translates all, sometimes seconds apart. It is stunning. <br /> And here's the key thing - the actor doing Rochester has transmitted that he spent about a decade in his life of utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, secret life to destroy No actor others I have seen trying to partake of this black hole in despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current favorite Toby Stephens fans do not even try. Dalton knocked it out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton doing Rochester in a single bar, I would say, "This guy is a problem, not even looking at it." It is that radioactive and tamped down agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only, in general, Jane's best I've seen, it is one of Janes's very producers who wanted to throw away the book of Jane books. No, folks who know "Jane Eyre" only in the 2006 version, Bronte did * not * describe a statuesque, robust Jane and eyebrows arch arch and mouth pouty. Instead, Jane Bronte is, indeed, poor, plain, dark, and little, and not beautiful. Zelah has a tiny mouth, eyes closed, and a bit of a nose. It's really "little." It does not have any fashionable models. And it is Jane's best, the true of the book. <br /> <br /> Some describe it a cold or boring. No, it's true of the book. Bront's Jane is not a hot red mother, it's a shelter, teen with inner patience out only at key times, as the Zelah does here. Jane in the book is someone you have to look slowly, carefully, with patience, observance, if you want to really wash his depths. You have to look Zelah, here, to know who he really is. <br /> I would like to see more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but this is one scene from five hours of which is it, otherwise, very good. In spite of its closure of the text, this version, like any other version I saw, shys away completely explains the Christian terms of "Jane Eyre." Christianity is not incidental subtext of "Jane Eyre," it is central . <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructed Jane of Christianity, thereby giving her a subversive, cultural counter way, and living, apparently finishing, trapped in life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who persuades poor, plain, obscure Jane to value her, she needs to live up to her ideal, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. This was not done completely clear here. In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and the adaptation of it, of those I saw, mining and honors novels best of any adaptations I saw, and hard to say. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not completely honor the book, end up being a chore to look at many places. If you do not care about what Charlotte Bronte has said about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on resemblance to money, your adaptation to many of the book will be something fast forward to going to the scene Kiss between Jane and Rochester. This version, like the Roman Bronte, realizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experience at Lowood, and his relationship to St. John - is a part of Jane's relationship with Rochester as an explosive and unforgettable as it is.
