Five years from the Tenco Survivors return home, and from Marion's double-sided "Well this". <br /> It's now 1950: time meeting. The whole gang here is: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and Maggie and Alice. The story unfolding is a beautiful one: as perfectly written and acting, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original set. <br /> <br /> All questions that hang at the end of the series are definitely answered here. From Marion's family to the Joss health center, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the better. <br /> A trip to Dominica's touring carries a lot of trauma and some really corner-of-seat tension. There's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate takes on and women are fighting for their lives. Dominic finally shows his true colors, and some moments call drama-to-telly in drama. <br /> <br /> Location of Singapore in Singapore, with an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they become friends. It is such a shame that this really is the end. I could look it all over again. Perfection.
