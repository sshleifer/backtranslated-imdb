Petter Mattei's "Love in Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a film that will tell you how much money, power and success can make people in different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> This was a variation on Arthur Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same, the director transferred the action to New York where all of these characters are different to meet and connect. Each person is connected in one way, or another in the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Gradually, the film has a sophisticated look great. We take into account how these people live and the world lives in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing one gets out of all the soul in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one resides. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relationships find genuine gains, as someone who is discovering is the case with most of those we meet. <br /> <br /> The act is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talent, make these characters come alive. <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and wait to worry about his next job.
