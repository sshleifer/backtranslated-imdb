Honestly, this is the best way to show anyone who has ever come up with. In order to win the money you actually have to be smart. Not only that you had to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. It actually requires skill. Not like some lame-ass shows that in those days. And yet, they have only two seasons in it! Bull .. they need to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> Although, they will have a hard time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. It was great. <br /> But seriously, it was an amazing show. You never knew who would be when. And it was so much fun to try to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted! <br /> Bring back the MOLE !!!! Bring back the MOLE !!!!
