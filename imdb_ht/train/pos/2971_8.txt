I found this movie to be very funny, I loved how he did in the politics of modern day sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park but it's very funny. And since I'm a sports fan I loved how to make fun of some of the most ridiculous things in sports. This film is great for sports lovers not too, probably better for them actually since they have to go into life asking why people follow sports so close when there are so much stiffness and intricacies of sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the real game they had come up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horses with base and psyche outs (for the person to shoot). Overall I highly recommend seeing this movie, and believe you will end up enjoying this movie. However if this style of comedy is not your favorite probably will not like it. (but that is with any comedy movie)
