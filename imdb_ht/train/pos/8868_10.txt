I said that Higher Learning is one of the 3 movies I've ever watched. It has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life at university can be. There are 3 main story lines, skewheads, African Americans, and gay. I was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that came to me most was the storyline about Kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After seeing the film 25 times more, I still cry. I would give this movie a 11, but I must settle 10/10.
