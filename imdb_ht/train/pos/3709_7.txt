Any adaptation screen in a story by John Grisham deserves a Hollywood approach approach, and Robert Altman is on the last director I would go for a mainstream to take on anything. But this south-fry skin-pot is very good. While it's not among the best Altman, he certainly is not among the movies she's made that lets you scratch yourself and wonder what he thought. Altman had tipped his hat to thriller the mystery and harmon noir before, in his 1973 film "Goodbye of Long." The "Gingerbread Man" is nowhere near as good as film, but it holds just fairly on its own. Kenneth Branagh is a fantastic lawyer who finds himself framing for murder after he gets involved with a customer (Embeth Davidtz) who has been engaging his help in protecting him from his father-in-law (Robert Duvall). The movie is set in Savannah, Georgia during the approach to a tropical storm, which lends film to an oppressive atmosphere that I love so much. Twists and turns toward the end of the film becomes clunkier and clunkier, and Altman proves himself to be not all that skillful in shooting shooting, but overall the film is not a bad addition to the Cannon Altona. Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Ana, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen.
