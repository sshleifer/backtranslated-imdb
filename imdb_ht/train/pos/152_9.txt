I saw "El Mar" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. It starts with an episode of life in the life of the main characters 3: Ramallo, Manuel Tur, and Francisca. And we flew over 10 years at a hospital where 3 friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and horror sexuality in all the films created with intense films and full blood pressure. > <br /> I see people complaining about the film being too gory and I think they miss the point in the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People must suffer. Cry. To do harm. For bleeding. And I think that the movie shows, is not done for the best value of the trauma or is presented in an unpleasant manner. I know that some people love the "own" films, even those who have violence in it. But sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel comfortable at work. This is one of those movies. With a big movie it is. <br /> <br /> The only fault I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some details drawn by being 100% clear, and only after thinking about the end of film, it all made sense . But it did not matter much of the story in general, so I still give this movie a 9.
