Story about four young girls growing in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the highest level at the top of the bunch - but she wants to move from her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and males and beats him with his father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks it is more mature than the rest of them. This is nothing new from what we've seen many times before - but this one has a big difference - it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the movie) and I was surprised at how realistic she was. They had dialogues, clothes and attitudes down. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before this out. This film hit me harder than any teen movie in the allotted time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school were just like this! The movie is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The act is good on all counts and Foster gives the best performance. The relationship between him and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done. Even Scott Baio (who has a role as a girl friend) more or less realistically played a teenage boy. <br /> A very good movie - look essential if you've come to age in 1980. The movie has a worthy R rating (many drug use and swearing), but should be seen by all adolescents. I give it a 8.
