I was well enjoy this movie, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is his grouping and other war cinemas, this movie was mechanized! It's not a movie war more than "A Fly on the Cocoa Nest" is an asylum movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about individually, nonconformity, self-confidence and costs such personality. The draw is the same as "A fly on the Cuckoos nest" and "Cool but Luke", its in good company, and it holds its own. These films it should be kept accountable and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Plato". <br /> Eric
