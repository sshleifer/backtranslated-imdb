Take 4 married couples who are already on rock and put them on an island paradise where they will be tempted by 26 singles. This quoted in the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. Let it give Fox to throw morality out of the window and let the flow of crackdown. It was like a real life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about convincing people & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship. People either enjoyed the show or hated it. It was kind of slowing down in view of a terrible traffic accident. You know you should not look, but you can not help but look. Dram aside, there was a lot of candy in sight.
