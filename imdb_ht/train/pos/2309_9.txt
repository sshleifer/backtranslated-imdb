He changed the life, he really was born !!! Man of the Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch.The play was fabulous, the storyline was great, and this was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career and did not see how anyone could love this movie How, it's not the best movie ever, though it was close to it, but it was very fun to look, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and a lot of other laughter little. Of course, there was some crying your heart out too, but this movie was enlightening, and it shone up your day, although you have to get a little depressed in the story every now and then, I can not believe that this movie did not have at least one award, and I can not believe it was seen by the little ones on this site. Watch this movie if you do not have it is definitely touch.
