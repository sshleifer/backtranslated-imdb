I read that this was not quite, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels he has failed in a way. <br /> I do not agree. First, it is well executed. Volckman is doing well for not just trying a new technique, but having a focus that is worth thinking about: would immobility reduce the value of life? Big question ... <br /> I can see it trying hard to build a feeling, and it's not compromised. This is to be applauded. I'm sure it was an exciting exercise to build characters in these forms. I saw that artists have reduced a minimum form to construct intensity at a time. I identified this movie with that. Further, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater's rakoto-skoping, and Volckman's story has more significance than later Linklater's history of a wasted life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but no one does. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in which are far better. <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
