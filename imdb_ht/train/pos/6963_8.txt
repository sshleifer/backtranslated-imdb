A great surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. The reviews were highly dismissed in it, though they all seemed to agree that the concept was gold: a man found out her new girlfriend is a super hero, and found, when she wants to break up with her, that she's kind of a psycho. I was hoping it fell apart, but it never really did. Sure, he does not do as much of his awesome interest as he can, and chooses to be short when it might be best to expand the film universe. But I can not blame it for that. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar superhero, G-girl. And I discovered, after several years of his desire, Luke Wilson could be absolutely perfect when dropping like a slumber. He gave two of the best performances in 2006 (the other in the very unreleased idiocrity). I absolutely split up in the expressions on her face when she and Thurman first sex. It is one of the sexiest scenes ever. My real complaint is that they make G-girls a bit too much of a psychic, as almost unbelievable. Perhaps with some background I could accept it better. I can forgive its flaws, though, because I had a really good time watching it. Melee, for sure.
