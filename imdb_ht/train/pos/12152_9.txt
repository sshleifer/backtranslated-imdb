I just saw this film on HBO, and it was really good ... a true love story really! I really appreciated the fact that the guy in the heart of the story was lost in the use of his leg in an accident. It's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically disabled. Love has been developing between this character and the woman who comes to his life nicely to describe how I would like to think of love to cure someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all at 27 when she made this film ... was great as the woman so full of her life can revive this guy's heart. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and it is not, "problem" develops. It's about playing HBO some times this month.
