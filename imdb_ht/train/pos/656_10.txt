In all the comments I read, most people were very hard on Alexandre. Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed to be particularly desperate to hold Alexandre, it was only a little clever even though not all intellectual, as most of us, however difficult it can be for anyone who admits. Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally cared for, getting and giving what he wants. Girls will allow this, veronika love sex, marie is her boss. Is anything wrong with any of this? Is anyone in love? really? I do not think so. Though French New Wave Cinema tends to pretend and so, it is pretty simply because of its lack of a need for a draw in order to create emotions. Facility is perfectly beautiful with everyone in the position of Alexandre, in an urban area that requires. I am looking for an employer, anyone interested?
