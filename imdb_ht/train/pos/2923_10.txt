Eddie Murphy really makes me laugh my ass on this HBO comedy show show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden in the "Honeymooners", Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson. The Ice Cream Game , Goony Goo Goo, is also funny. I saw this for the first time when she came from 1984. I laughed so hard, I almost fell into my seat. I still think this is very funny. Eddie Murphy, when she was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so hard, he is one of the best people out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is better off its next performance at "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs and 10/10 stars.
