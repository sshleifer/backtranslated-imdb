I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theater. "October the sky" feels and looks oh so familiar. And it is. All compression plots and emotions are explored before in other films - and possibly even better. But despite being familiar with resistance to all hollywood formulas, this film has love and every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is inspirational for this journey of heart, mind, and soul. Just as the characters from the music of Merrily music Steven Sondheim, we wanted to go up agape at the top of the apartments hoping to launch their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle.") Sputnik has a similar effect on the boy boy rocket in this true story. While colder throughout the 1950s charter was postponed, Homer Hickham saw Sputnik as his ticket from a mining life. <br /> <br /> Hold the direction and drop to make the trip to Homer boy rocket and pale it looks fresh and new. Especially affected are subplots regarding Homer's young teacher. Notable constraints are depicted in describing delicate relations. Also remarkable is the superstar of the father / child of the film frame. Perfectly played around. Even Homer's mom gets her momentum clamor or intrusion. Its ultimatum in her husband is both showing dignity and warmth. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> A great video game that I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you will love this movie or your money will be repaid. For once, I agree with them. You will never look in the October sky quite the same again. <br /> <br />
