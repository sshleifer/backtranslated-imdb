If you read Mother Night and enjoyed it very much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element in Writing the Vonngut - beyond her story lying Vonnegut herself, and that you can not put a human mind on the screen. Its white and humor just can not be transcribed by a scenario or even better performance in acting. I believe that this film goes beyond asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but these are often cynical moments of satire found in the page they do not get on the screen. Does this mean that the movie is missing the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the film succeeds because it does not try to recreate the reading experience of the book (this is not a way for too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's most artistic treasures and presenting it to a framework without pretense. I saw other movie versions of the book Vonnegut where the director obviously tried the Vonnegut engineering channel and lost the grip on his own craft. I would not put that movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own lap as one well worth watching. Do not take Vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie narration or trying to insert it however he can, Mother Night tells her story brilliant, and preserves the fundamental lessons of the story without confusion, distraction, or deception.
