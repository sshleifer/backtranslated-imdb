By touring the name of Hazlihurst's non-force (which won it an AFI Award) is at least on account of its efforts in FRANCE three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and, for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as the nursery, and Michael Caton (best known for the CASTLE) is a bearded penthouse. (Also interesting, Hazlehurst is now the host of home and garden form programs, and Caton is the host of property-type programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT OWN, etc.) This film reaffirms the popular belief that was born that Noni was arguably arguably Australian women's during the early 1980s. Rating: 79/100.
