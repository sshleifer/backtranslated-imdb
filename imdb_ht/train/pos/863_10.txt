I was totally engrossed in this movie from the first minute. It is brilliant shot, with many interesting and original angles and technical staff. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues alike. She hired an assistant to work, with her true intention to find love. He is an ex-con and he takes advantage of him to avenge revenge on those who hurt him. In return she must help her with an heist who asks her lip reading skills to pull it off. The movie transcends into a dark black film, with a couple of really great scenes, and a final finish. The real beauty of this movie comes from the way the director takes advantage of the main character's disability. Use sound to keep the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silent noise to keep the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and abondones of erotic sexual repression you had their marketing in a huge movie. It's the sort of Hollywood movie really want to do, but just can not.
