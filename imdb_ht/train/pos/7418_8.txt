"Shower" is a story about loyalty, on the advanced advanced in modern worlds of detriment in rather traditional ways and more people in their lives. A man was forced to choose between his successful career in business, his big-city life, his wife, and delayed his young brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. The modern China against the ancient one. The public bushes and its rally, fighting its cricket against the shopping centers and the skyscraper. Many men and women are no longer needed. China, a country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... though one of them is killing the other. <br /> <br /> Tense, moving, full of funny moments, and in bitter-sweet ones.The tender are weeping and laughing equally. The actors are enormous, especially someone who performs the role of the boy; and Yang Zhang does a great job, easy, simple, leaving the story just shed alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Me: 8/10
