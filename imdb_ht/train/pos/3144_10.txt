This is one of the best comedies ever on TV. One season was hilarious as they were most of those seasons. The only reason that I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut people's imagination, often depicting the famous TV shows or movies from the 70's. It's a rare show in that I liked every character ( with the exception of the final season ... too late trying to develop a new character and feats was not nearly as funny). The Red Tree at the beginning of your mother has never been old, nor did the Kelso stupid. Bravo fox to hold such a good show long, too long.
