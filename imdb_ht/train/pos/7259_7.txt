How the viewer rating for this movie should be just 5.4? Just lovely portrait Alisan Porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating. James Belushi is good at this too, his first good serious role, I did not love him at anything but last night until that. He was very good at gang related to Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you have to love it. Well, I do. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
