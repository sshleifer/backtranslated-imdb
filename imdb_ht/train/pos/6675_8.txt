Directly behind this film was fantastic for a comedy. Many of the scenes appear to be from a comic book and lots of darkness (visually - not wise stories) than what I hope. Granted, this can not be the hottest movie ever made, especially if you are in many sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others as something about Mary or American Pie). As you rip it, several jokes stand out and find funnier. If you ever read a comic book or watch a comic-type comic book (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and love them, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the film. If you do not like them, you might like the ridiculous compliance that this film has for such. If you've done like this movie, the DVD has some cool extras. (8/10)
