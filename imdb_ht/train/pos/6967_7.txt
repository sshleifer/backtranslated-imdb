A prequel of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as the new series of co-creators Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in development that would become the Cylon race. The pilot and the series are set to follow the two families; The Graystone including Daniel (Eric Stoltz) a computer engineering and corporate tycoon and Zoe (Alessandra Toreson) as well as its brutal rebels, while Adam's includes Joseph (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son William The Admiral of Battlestar Galactica. Like the Battlestar Galactica series includes some great actors experienced by Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker as well as some relatively talented new actors including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. In the Pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present, but are smaller part of this series. The scenes about Caprica while reflecting a more advanced technological society also have retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architecture, costumes and ways it has been shot. <br /> While the look and feel of the series have some substantial differences in the terms they will seem very familiar, the religion is still very important here, while the racial theme rarely touches over at BG is far more important. We touch on terrorist existence of a soul and if not a machine can be one, as well as issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The Pilot has released direct to DVD in an extended and unrated version before time on TV, the series is set to begin in 2010. Like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver
