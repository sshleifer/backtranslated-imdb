As we all know a romantic comedy is the genre and the already-known finish. The two drivers still have to get together. The third act I tried to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end together. A sign has been given right from the start, but you will never achieve it until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It must have you covered a lot of the usual ground, but take a cool turn as ever as possible. I loved all NY characters and I loved where they were. It's a postcard in NY. Also it was nice to watch a movie and not find anything offensive to it. So, if you like a good old fashioned romantic movie ... then this is for you.
