I only want that back on Thursday, led by someone else, I mean, there are too many ewoks scene scenes, completely unnecessary. In addition to this time our hero resembles different people: Princess Leia does not fight with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as wrong as before, and Yoda just dies. <br /> But there are many extraordinary things to go about this episode that I just can not hate her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The 3-Emperor (now evil) 4- Speeders chase in the jungle. 5-Battle of the Past. 6-Scenes of seductive black side. 7-Back to Anakin in the right side of the force. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of these are so good that they can bring tears in your eyes. If some scenes were cut, and another director was hired, this would be as perfect as Episode 4 and 5, but still extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
