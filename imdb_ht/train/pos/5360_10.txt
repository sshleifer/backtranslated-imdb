Among the movie one movie liner films in action, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If those in charge of casting have put "good" actors in this movie, it would be worse (except Richard Dawson who actually behaved, if you can call yourself "acting"). I like this movie! The Running Man is likely to luck the god of man (okay maybe just men). Definitely the most quotable movie of our time so I'm going to party with my favorite line: "It's all part of Brenda's rich life style, and your best f ***** g get used to it." Ahh, more people have called "Brenda" for the sake of quoting this movie than I can possibly imagine.
