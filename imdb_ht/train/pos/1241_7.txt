This movie is very fun, with any criticism based on personal preference - not the movie quality. Other than the too much common profanity in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great car for his humor style. It has some very special effects, and exciting action scenes. As a child loses, Murphy's character starts looking for a missing girl, leading him on the path that others believe he was "choosing" - to protect the Golden Child. The boy is born as one illuminated, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose life is very in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mysterious help / guide / protection. /> <br /> There are also philosophical lessons for challenging audience members who are interested in reflecting on deep thinking. One such scene is where the Golden Child, which Murphy's character is required to protect, tested by the monks in the hill temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of decorative necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. This is a fantasy / comedy based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world that most people are completely unaware. As we accept this quote of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a daily perceived fact, and prepare for the earth and walls to break, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us. <br /> <This is an excellent film, with a good plot, fine act, and for the most part, very decent dialogue combine a serious topic with a health balance in martial arts battles, and Eddie Murphy humor.
