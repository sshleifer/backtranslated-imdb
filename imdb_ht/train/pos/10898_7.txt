This movie is not as bad as I hear. It was enjoyable, funny and I like that revolving around the holiday season. It totally has me in the mood of Christmas shopping and listening to holiday music. Then this movie comes out on DVD it will take place in Christmas Holidays in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy but I think he just adds to the movie and why they must be so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I loved it. No, it is not Titanic and it will not make your heart and anticipation book but it will carry on a laugh or two. So go laugh and have a good time :)
