This is one my beloved military drama! Tom Berenger is playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This marine has no nonsense, in your face, and there is no question that requires the type of person to get the job done. There are Billy Zane (the "Phantom" and others) who play Richard Miller, a former SWAT D.C., work for the government and take only orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are scared, sparks should fly. And how. Beckett, however, teaches the bureaucrat's youth about his work. When the other sniper hitch, it's wits against blood, cat vs mouse, gun vs gun. But when the season sniper retains, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you a pro like Beckett, has taken command from no one's hand, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is carried out despite the politics. The movie was a direct hit. Look-l. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
