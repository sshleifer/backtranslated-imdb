I do not know which films some of these others have looked, but they must have seen a different "Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration" than I saw. <br /> I think the movie was both well done and inspired. I think it's definitely worth seeing. It's apparent from the outset that a lot of care enters into doing this movie. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> I think the film does a great job in presenting Joseph Smith both as a person and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are described with taste and reverence. I would definitely recommend watching this film.
