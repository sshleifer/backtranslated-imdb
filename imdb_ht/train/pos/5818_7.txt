Actually this movie has silly moments, both in part of claymation and Joe Pesci's and children's parts, and it's worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz," "Captain Eo" and "Fantom". But like a dead fan of Michael Jackson since nearly eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can not complain too much about it. Just see this cute guy and hear his wonderful music it is a journey to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm scared, that it would get a much lower class for me, if my Mike dear was not the one to start at it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, he has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.
