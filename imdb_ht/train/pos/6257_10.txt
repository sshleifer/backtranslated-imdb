This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw it tonight on channel channel Turner Classic. I think I'll see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. The movie film does not look all the timely and ineffective as you might think from 1925 B & W silent film. Put in Iran in 1925, people in the nomads of documentaries left deserted and crossed a raging river, men, women, children, animals ... then got up and over a snowy mountain than all Barefoot. It is leaking or swimming and up or dying. In search of grass for animals. They have cattle, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene a man is carrying a moth too sick to climb up the hill. Children in the documentaries all look happy and healthy. They were such a difficult life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran are still living like this. Have you appreciated modern life in the USA.
