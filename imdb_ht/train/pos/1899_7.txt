Arthur Bach needs to grow, but this is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do. According to his very wealthy father, Arthur has married a certain wealthy Susan Johnson or was cut to the family money ($ 750 million worth). The problem is, Arthur does not like Susan (even though I heard her do some good chicken) and she just fell head-on-heels for the waitress and part-time liver Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting fellow. It's really just a big kid, made of wealth and at least someone looking after her every second of every day. Working just rub Arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, humor, and of course, drink. Drink to Arthur a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while that gets it into all sorts of issues, it's absolutely hilarious to look on the screen. Dudley Moore is great here in this movie as Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe winning for her performance. Moore is fantastic with the comical aspects of the movie, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable gold comedy, but it is also great to bring Arthur down to a level that is relatable and makes the character likable. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the Spiritual Who Arthur can not get enough of, and John Gielgud is terrific like Hobson Butler Arthur. Gielgud won Oscar best known for his performance in this film, and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a rock-solid circle to understand and glued to mood, but he's still looking out for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's movie Arthur Arthur is short and simple but delivers a lot-laughing.
