This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular movie genre. I was pleased to see William Powell touching a detective and charismatic and charming story, and without the humorous attitude of Nick Charles's character (from the "Thin" series). While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz's fantastically imaginary direction. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured film, and Curtiz shows an incredible order of the medium; From scratch screen images, to strange camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrated that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Very recommended if you are fond of this type of film.
