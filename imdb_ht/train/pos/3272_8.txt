Coming to the same director who would make "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised at a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I have never heard of until now, yet it must be one of the best movies in the late 80s - in part because it's down but the worst film period in recent decades. (Not speaking of Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The act is not brilliant, but simply solid - unlike some people here claiming (to have been dreaming of this "beautiful acting", much like Anna) . The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that ties the whole loop close together neatly. These unanswered questions are probably left to the goal, leaving it up to the person's interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with that with such a theme. "Pepperhaus" is a bit strange weird in children's films and horrors, with effective use of sound and music. I love the fact that the central character is not typical film-clich√© or ultra-shy but-in cache-brilliant social-outcast girl, but a regular, normal kid; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who are sick-like children in their books and on their screens, as if anyone cares so much to look or read about yet another toddler, as if they are all there or as if the kind of background character holds a good potential monopoly. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoked feelings of both wave and entertainment - assuming that he was supposed to only 11, but his adventure turned out Burke was 13 or 14 then filmed. I have no idea why they did not upgrade the age character or find a younger actress. It was quite obvious that Burke is not young. Why directors always throw kids more than they play, hence the realism lies, I will never know.
