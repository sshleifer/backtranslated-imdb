A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that recalls laughing from the beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the oldest comedian who has taken part with his former partner (Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final stage show. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau silver and nephew, and the two have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's character - it's just as it always is, and yet also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, as absent-minded old man, is just funny as Matthau. > <br /> Matthau: Want some crackers? I had coconuts, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Matthew: I did not groan. I got coconut, pineapple and graham <br /> <br /> Burns: okay <br /> <br /> Matthew: In the cupboard in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about this: Matthieu: When I was dark, white they knew what I was saying! <br /> You've got to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> In all, an interesting hilarious, sweet, tender, warm, belivable comedy character and a heart of some of the most memorable quotes are ever. <br /> They just do not like them again! At a time when all the newest comedies are bullies, juvenile and stupid, this backs back towards the sensitive core of what really comedy is - funny characters, intelligent and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment. In the best friends of all ages, right standing with "aircrafts, trains and automobiles," "lethal weapons," and "the hard way". <br /> You can have a hard time finding this for renting or watching TV, but trusting me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> -.
