This was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable had done together and would go on doing several more. Star Crawford is a rich young girl who is wiped from the stock market crash and has nothing left for her and her brother. They never worked before with William Bakewell, becoming a Gable worker, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy task but gets in on himself very fast. Crawford becomes a reporter in a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories, but given the worthless things to work on. They are a massacre in which several of Gable's people were killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a good movie but not one of their best.
