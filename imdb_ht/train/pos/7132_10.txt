A cancer film. The superb abbey acting by John Thaw, who has been spending over recently. A man who was still subversive. He was one of England's top 10 actors certainly in my time. <br /> It may be remembered for his famous role in Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in 1970's TV series Sweeney and as a barrister at Kavanah QC. A must see for the whole family with a great DVD for my collection. The film will bring back a few memories for those who recall Britain's wars and certainly those who have been evacuated from London to save the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and William's boy were really well-versed in the book by Michelle Magorian.
