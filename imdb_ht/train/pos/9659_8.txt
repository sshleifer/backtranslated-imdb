'Rene Presque' is a very well-portrayed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Explain both stereotypes and preaching, it's a wonderful naturalist, superbly acting film, shotgun and a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If anything is almost too realistic, as there's little in the way of conventional plot, just the scene of a life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might be in such a subtile sketch world. 'Risky Presque' might not be the most exciting movie ever to make; but its simple human being serves it well compared to the pre-pregnancy or bigoted frequencies that are often marginal treatments in this term. Worth a look.
