When I learned about Sir Alec Guinness's death, this was the first of his many films I thought of being re-seen. What a wonderful comment the movie gives even after all these years. And Guinness helps them tie the charm of each frame. Her eyes and figures are as glowing as her white suit puts. Both of them and the movie have to be considered lifetime favorites.
