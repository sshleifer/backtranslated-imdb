I pitched up late flanking cables a night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes to the start - every time I even thought of going to bed, something caught on telling me to keep on watching it though It was way way past to sleep. <br /> <br /> This could film another easy slam dunk anti-gun film, but instead chose to examine after the effects of shooting them. And even better, the movie keeps on with the real life - just when you think they will take the easiest and obviously converted way out, a twist comes along with the whole outlook change of the movie. This film not only does not follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and / or affect what happens next. <br /> I only want the filmmakers to explore the issues around more anti-depressant drugs - the children from Columnbine who have shot them were over for years and have been scared to watch the Deanna road popped up whenever bad dreams they started. Until recently, things have been dispensed as candies and only now they even begin to understand what long-term drug effects they have. It was very refreshing to see that aspect of mental illness in the story was given quite a bit of film, having a family that suffered from a mental illness, I can say that the film was dark black over in all the aspect mental illness. Bravo gives the director and writer who obviously did their homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things could not happen to a hospital (I do not mean any particle), you will die so badly - I was there. The script was so real it was amazing. <br /> Go buy this movie and show it to your kids before it's too late. One day, they will thank you for it.
