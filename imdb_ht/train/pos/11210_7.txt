Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one lady very likely many years ago. She was a wealthy doctor's wife and she had a lot of money out of the program. Her passion was animal and she devoted herself to a temple for the furry people on her property grounds. Trudy also raised from chimps to his home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had plenty of equipment. One day she learns an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about their great, it depends on her husband's medical ability and expert advice to save Gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides it will increase the gorilla, too, as one of its children. This works well for years and Buddy, the Gorilla, is really a remarkably smart home addition. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Can Trudy Keep Buddy Under Control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and Mark have made a unique relationship in the stories of animal history and lore. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one, in the movie, but it is very close that looks totally real. Russo gives a beautiful performance as a lady before its time and players are also well-liked. The costumes are exemplary, as befitting the earliest era of history, and their environment and exceptional production value. But most importantly, animals are here in abundance, not only buddy, but their admirable chimpanzees, ducks, rabbits, and so forth. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to the animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family movie, will go "Ape" on Buddy.
