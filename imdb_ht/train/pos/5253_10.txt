I really do not understand why people get angry with this movie boiler! Remember, this is a SNL movie, nothing that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! Ladies Ladies is a hilarious movie, albeit stupid at times, with a wacked-out throw and, as usual, WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible but its comedy! I really do not understand how one could not laugh much during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take this as it is - a funny, funny and irreverent SNL. There is nothing that will win prizes, but there are some modern comedy gold. "10-4 Abiko!"
