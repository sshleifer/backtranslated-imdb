Humorous Excellence Humorous I Do not Believe How Someone Can Think It deserves a 1/10! I hope this movie will be widespread for everyone to enjoy it If you ever have the opportunity, watch it ... Do not miss it There is a party when the principal actors are driving and singing "Happy Birthday" and "el payroll payroll "(an Argentine song for children (I think ... it could also be South Americans, I'm not sure)). Two songs that have the same melody ... but people do not usually realize that ... it just grids! I tried to write this in both Spanish and English, because it's an Argentine film ... but the page would not allow me :( Hope you enjoy it!
