Here is an innovative TV drama; which is so easy to mix a compelling, glossy story to draw out character development, humor, romance, and drama in every episode. Here is a show that sings in his own melody, whether it's audience chooses to follow or not. How many other TV shows do these days boldly change to tune from one next season? Where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works in viewers and dollars, and they have been stuck like glue that formula (Prison Break, 24, and Desperate Housewives come to mind ) - LOST takes a different route where even after achieving trays with that formula, the team of executive producers is brave enough to fully reinvent the show in order to achieve greater goals in compelling stories. This is where LOST differs itself from normal TVs. This is how it's so provocative in conventional TVs. And this is why LOST is one of the most cutting edge and innovative television innovations. Forget the naysayers - LOST is, who, and always, has appeased it to cult after the first and public in the next general. But it is a will of his invention that he's garnered a fan base that includes the best of both audiences.
