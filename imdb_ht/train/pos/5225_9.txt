I think this film is a very funny movie with one of the best 'National Lamp' films, it also has a very addictive title, which basically sums up that the movie is all about .... White !!!! The story is a parody of many films including a Will Smith movie, as you might have guessed, 'The Black Men'. I will not give the finish but it has a very good finish is very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humor) from start to finish, especially the bit near the start when you are on the street collecting the dustbins (garbage box) . Also, they have a very cool dustbin truck (Fatra Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The act is not superb, actually, it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, loosening up !! I love the story line, in part because it is so far sought and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (or you should read Un-subtle) to tear all the other films. I'm a big fan of films that are not reliable, but I'm also a fan of real things, and this movie, it's hard to decide which is best, the movie it's mostly the rattle (mentioned earlier this review) or the current film is, but also when you are actually doing a parody of comedy movie, it actually makes it even harder, but this movie brings it to success. The garbage crowds are so funny, he reminds me of a TV shows in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This movie is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most fun, funniest, best scenarios, the National Nude films on the date !!
