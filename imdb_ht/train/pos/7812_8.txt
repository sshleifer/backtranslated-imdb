A long film about a very important character in South Africa, Stephen Biko. It is one of those blacks that did not survive apartheid, which actually died a long time before their normal time. The already old movie though does not show how important Biko was, what it really represents. His life and teaching are reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. The film was from 1987, the goal was to push South Africa on the brink that would bring it to liberation. So the movie aims to show how irrational South African supporters of apartheid, in 1987. To show that the movie has to look beyond Biko, hence at its speech center is not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and escape the absurd system in which he lives. His escape was made necessary because of the victim he is the victim, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and can only happen in England. The movie shows a way to save South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. He could not. But the film is broader, because it does not show South Africa and any historical distraction, the very distribution that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and so-called forgiveness to those who want to forgive talk and out. The movie is strong and emotional, but very historical boundaries make it rather weak today, especially since the movie does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have that flaw: they are looking at the people they are supposed to portrait from one point of view. This explains why the film of many ages seems to come as long as nothing has changed at all. A rum is needed. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Saint Quentin of Yvelines, CEGID
