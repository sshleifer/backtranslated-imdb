Did you see all the movie released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say that it is the best movie I've seen all year long. Most American films feature black or black obsess on American occupation and "race relationships", or fall into the clicks in the inner city ghetto, with each ebony-phrased eccentric imagery spouting yellow. Celebrating Fisher stands proud and alone in this sense: race is irrelevant, saved for a battle that can or may not be provoked by a racial slur. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is incredible, thoughtful, described by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using its star power to have the movie made, sticks in the background for the most part, and allows the movie to be the story of anew Fisher. At a time when BET, and popular culture in general want to keep the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a movie that speaks to the humanity of all of us. I just hope that the non-black audience will go see this movie for humanity, rather than avoiding it because they feel that there is no character or actor in the movie that they can identify with. This would be a sad fan of race-related relations in North America and in itself. <br /> <br />
