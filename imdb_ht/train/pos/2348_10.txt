This show is quick-witted, colorful, black again fun, hip and still somehow neat. The cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (That's Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family, and zombie without ever coming on as cartoony ... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. The whole output is an easy magic act that leaves me, something in a septic if I say so myself, totally egr and comes back for more everyday Wednesday night. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like someone paying me to write it. It's really good. I just heard a rumor that she was being canceled so I thought I would send in a rocket of good will. This is one of those who goes under the radar because the network costumes can not figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Make yourself a great favor, if you have not already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK is so one more thing. Show this is smart. What is meant is that every critical critic / "writer" in Hollywood is going to put a stick up youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defend themselves with a "I could have written that" nobody of the lonely renovated Hollywood hotel rooms. In other words: the Internet. This is a general interest / anonymous website. Before you give Wednesday your television hours of Sexy Money or next to Hot Model or any other out there and these "critical" Internet troops do not comment on, give my fave a show. It's fun. Well, fun unpretentious.
