Zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment, it delivers a message about its specialized school shooting. The life table of friends Andrew and Cal leading up to a high school attack. The movie also started in a somewhat unassuming fashion, an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in young romantic style followed by short encounters with the boy families. It is not long before we are down to business with the boys who show us their collection of weapons, love their fetishists, their imagination sporadic imaginative Nazis and even in a controversial scene how to build bomb tapes. So what movie is trying to say? What really motivates these will soon be killer. It seems difficult to really identify. They certainly do not come across like cold blood sugar again, they plan an absolute brutality. This brings me to what I feel is the genius of partial zero days. Cal and Andrew still talk about how much they are at a different level, how much above the rest of us and how they will 'leave us all behind.' Like the Colombian killer they really feel superior. Like Nietzsche's resentment, Cal and Andrew's values ​​systems seem to have been made out of rejection from society. But we are given only this glimpse, an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example. So where is the motivation? What I feel is that Coccio describes two desperate people to make a statement about superiority of a gesture of power again with no reasonable venue for him. Hence, they go back to mass killings and types that will garner them more attention than they could ever achieve. That's why the party shooter seems to be able to carry out acts of atrocity despite coming out of stable stable homes. The murder is part of a fantasy, Cal and Andrew are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions. They turn fantasy into tragedy. <br /> <br /> What is secondly most enthralling on this film is the development of Character and the unique Cal and Andrew dependence on each other. Andrew is in the entire movie overtaking the leader of two, embracing the Cal in his attitude and attentively looks somewhat forced. Andrew is impressive, Andrew is intense and serious. It completely shuns others except for his family, it is meticulous and precise about everything he does and temporarily appears first movement of the plot to attack the school. But he is likable in his own way, he does not embrace nonsense and our party feels compelled to agree with him, but these moments are broken by Andrew's passionate jest towards our audience to treat We are both confused and potential victims. Cal in the other hand looks more relaxed than Andrew, more accepting in reality. But it is in its own way prevailing. We have a lot of personal moments in Calle's video interview and video, when it's alone and apart from Andrew. Cal seems to have difficulty with his own personal demons and using plans to exercise himself in them. Andrew is jealous of Cal going to the prom and an old friend, he wants to be all alone. Cal placates Andrew and encourages him. For the first time in his life Andrew seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he can not lose it. Also Cal has found someone who offers him a way out. The film certainly picks up speed and improves as it closes its grim conclusion. There is an excellent time when Cal goes to the high school bullet. Suddenly the star of the film becomes shy and introverted, not at all in ease with its peers. But we are inclined to feel more connected with Cal than with the rooftop rooftop crowd screaming juvenile obscenities also drunk heavily to the Limo. They are an all too common and recognized episode. We do not want to relate to them, when it is over and Cal is back and Andrew silently preparing one of the final videos we love the characters feel once again to safely facilitate the fantasy world they have created. We feel like shunning the masses as they have. <br /> <br /> The Penultimate scene is superb. The final video sees Andrew and Cal arming themselves in their cars just before time attacked. It's all too real and really creates a sense of next bankruptcy. Do not know we know Cal and Andrew and they can be accomplished to actually do it, and one kind of morbid passion also relishing the catharsis films. <br /> <br /> The massacre shot in CCTV mode is at shocking times, and it was certainly the perfect option to show the massacre if we went through it is not canceled in flaws. What's more important is the sudden radical change of our perception of Cal and Andrew, the look of this sudden man is the bloodless killer we knew they would again refuse to acknowledge that they would. It is violent and real, our heroes became monsters and the reality of fantasy are a terrible tragedy, which cost them everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Do you know Andrew and Cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they actually go forever and that they certainly did not have anything. <br /> <br /> Zero day is a must see for anyone interested in violent acts sensationalized by the media. It is a character study well worth experiencing.
