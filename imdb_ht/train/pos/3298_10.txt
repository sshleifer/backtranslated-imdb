This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has everything - a merely simply, fine actor who makes the subtlety a nice art to look, a romantic actually elegant (it's a shame that the kind of romance just does not seem to exist again), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that you want to live in. The finish was only a disappointment in that I was expecting a spectacular movie to have a brilliant end - but it was still the most beautiful then the vast majority of movies out there. Definitely check out this movie out - over and over again. There are many details missing the first time that deserve a second look.
