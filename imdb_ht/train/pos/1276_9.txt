I like this movie. The noir image combines with the specifics of the nonsense feature of the Mike Hammer Mike Hammer to create a mood and feel rarely found in low budget detective films of fifty soldiers early. It may not be the 'Maltese Falcon' but this movie makes its own solid contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, but his 'lady' is the way to male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as effectively played by Biff Elliott, is blind to the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist that he meets when investigating the death of an army friend. When the penny finally drops his face is a picture. Good to see that Censorship 50s did not force the movie makers to skip the famous line of the past. A good low budgetary budget.
