This is a very interesting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and never get bored with it. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> I actually prefer this Braveheart movie as Braveheart has a lot of rigueu historical. There are many exciting scenes - look out for the Bridge scene and the fencing scene. This is really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful ... it really suits the film. The environment is amazing.
