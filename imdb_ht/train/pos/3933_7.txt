The problem with a real-life image is that the performance may be good, but still does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor will describe the person. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a terrific performance, but I found it difficult to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft-talking as Fonda shows him. This is essentially a drama court and a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. If not this was a true story, I do not know, but if it's not, then why say it using Lincoln as the central character? Never forget though. In the film, Lincoln defended two young men accused of murder. <br /> There's really not much film, and as a result, it seems rather empty. I wanted more history and character development. The movie is 100 minutes long, but it does not feel like it. Some little scenes featuring Lincoln and the blooming relationship with Mary Todd, but they look like superficial. <br /> <br /> The act is good all around, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not believe that the real Lincoln was that soft-talking. True, he has a great voice when he needs, such as when he persuades a drunken lynch movie to stop the trial, but Fonda shows Lincoln as well as meekly. The other performances are solid though, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. It's a wonderful lady that we can really feel for. Simple and unkult, but very sweet; We can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. John Ford seems to think this movie as a season, and at the time of its release, it's probably been. But even then, there's just not enough material to present it as such. <br /> It's a nice look, but not a classic.
