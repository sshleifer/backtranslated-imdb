I saw this first movie when it came out. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie both very fun and scary and unlike any other movie I've seen up to that time. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a major star of the Aquilae constellation to find out what happened in a colony of colonists who landed twenty years before and had never heard of since. <br /> TEME: An inferior civilization (namely we) comes in contact with the bodies of a very alien civilization, Krell-200,000 years are removed. The "seeds" of destruction of one civilization have passed over another, unknowingly at first. The theme of this movie is many good vs evil. <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother when it came originally. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me like did the battle scenes with the unseen Christian-force. I was also surprised at just how real things look at the movie. <br /> <br /> What really captures my attention as an adult even though the truth of the movie is "prohibiting knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we make (if ever) come into contact with An advanced civilization (alien) is more developed than we are now. Advanced technology and responsibilities seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge and wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> I learned from graduates that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, not correct! Knowledge is "potential" may depend on how it applies (... if it applies to all.) [Not what you know, but how do you use what you know!] The impact of this movie can be quite real-time in the Mankind's own future. This is the knowledge and in itself is not enough, we must, be wise in knowledge depending on really controlling our own destiny YOU will end up like Krell's in the movie just winked-out. Many thanks to earlier versions of this article and comments and corrections are all very appreciated !! I hope you are as entertained by this story as much as I have been over 40+ years ago. <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
