I really think this movie is great, personally. But in each movie there is a downe. Now, some of you may have not watched Hillary Duff's 'up your voice', but if you think about it, these two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In 'Brave New Girl', Holly wants so much to get in the Haverty Conservatory. In 'lifting your voice', Terri wants to go to a conservatory at L.A. (do not remember the name of the Conservatory). They are both in the music field, and they both must sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny as these films seem. I personally like 'Brave New Girl' better than, 'Raise your voice' though.
