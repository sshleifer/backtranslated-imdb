"Cow" is a movie I remember for it to paint the youth in the late 1970s. As I'm exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I am related to this movie. It deals with frustration, temptation, relationships and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great and inspired example rock. "More Than a Sentiment" by Boston and sad numbers such as "On The Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I'll always remember this one, though it was not great.
