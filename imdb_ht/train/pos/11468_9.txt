I'm frankly surprised how little did in the movie about the Columbine massacre. No important documentary, very puzzling. Fortunately we were honored with the talent of Ben Coccio that led ZEWO days, and Gus Van Sant who made the ELEPHER equally fine. Two different take on the event, which have the common idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there's something ultimately bewildering and subconscious about the motivations of the two assassins, and what actually drove them bring it beyond fantasy in horrible reality. ZERO DAY, allegedly made up of videos made by shooters, he found out after the event, is absolutely fixed. Even if you know where it will be, you still harbor hopes it will not "go there" ... and the tense of the final minutes of the film is excruciating. The film is terrific in the bottom, from the script director (not many etc., even though it looks very spontaneous) of the two actors lead, and players are supported as well. There is one aspect of ZEWO day that troubled me. Well, so we can not understand why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was the HUNGARY. But these boys do not really look mad. They can say some things to indicate they are, but in fact they did not convince me that they were Something inside that forced to kill innocent people. But this always left me with the sense of "why ???" that Coccio director wants me to have. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will crawl up on you and stay with you for a long time. BLAIR WITCH as they could only WISH for the kind of success those guys had made in a mock documentary.
