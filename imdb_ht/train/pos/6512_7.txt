My baby's sitter was a fan of so I've seen many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo so I do not know why I left the TV on that premiered show. My surprise I found it enjoyable. For me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * Dodge tomatoes from fans of the others * so I love that they only focus on these two. However, this can cause fans of the original show to hate it. I like the voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I like to listen to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds like me really enjoying his work as an actor. I also get a kick from the technology and a little bit autism and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act out the Star Wars scene (do not call those in the show, of course).
