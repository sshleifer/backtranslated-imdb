I just saw a screening press in this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Not often is it that I get to see all my favorite actors in one movie at one time. <br /> I really enjoyed the pick puppet scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together. I think the chemistry on camera is a direct result of time together in cameras. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... Without giving too much, I'll just say there's a surprise that let you hang ... <br /> The old couple was really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and the Hawke segments bake a punch and similar surprises similar to the experience that I had in the big apple. Over all the movie is a great place to take a date ... especially if you're already fond of the city itself. <br /> I can not wait for the next to the Cities of Love.
