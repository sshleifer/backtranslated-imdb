While a 9 might seem like a very high score for such a small film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective films from the 1930s and 40s, this is among the very best and also compares the highly favorable Powell later "Thin Man" movie. Now this does not mean that the film is that similar to the thin Man movies, such as CASENN MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more a traditional-detective film. Now you would think that no Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic sidekick (something found in practically all films detective films) together so fun would be a detriment, but I did not miss them at all because It was such an exceptionally well-written movie - with a really interesting case as well as exactly the exact performance of all .. The movie starts at the dog show called the Kennedy Killer Murder, though this Philo Vance movie actually spends little in the time of the dog show and the dogs are not a super-important part of the movie. Instead, a very hateful person was killed and left in a completely sealed room - a re-idea of ​​quite a few other detective films (such as the DOCTOR's critical case). However, how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together pretty well - keep my interest at all. I am sure that other detective films of the day had as scheduled intelligence scheme and exceptional acting as this one. This one is definitely a keeper.
