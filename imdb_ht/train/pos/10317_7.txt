Do you know how Star Trek fans have been gathering in all Star Trek movies, even those really bad? Why? To see the heroes in action one more time. So I feel about Doc Savage. I'm a big fan of the character, and the prospect of seeing docs and her crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only intensify the feeling of anticipation. Then they decided to cement elements from a number of warning documents and cast them to one movie, causing a movie a bit of breakfast. There are a lot of promises here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) but the spirit of the doc, and that's what we're familiar with Doc and the crew it responds . So in my long-standing way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters must check this movie out just getting familiar with the hero who gave inspiration to them all.
