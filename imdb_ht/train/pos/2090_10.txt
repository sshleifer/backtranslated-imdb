This is where the term "classic movie" comes from. This is a wonderful story of a woman's courage, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan was sold from her single husband, who over the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, a PEARL !!) Luise Rainer was the lovely star that won the Oscar the best comic year before for her role (and what a waste of an oscar) in the "Great Zigfield". He really did not show what, if any, his talent had other than his exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" it shows that it can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costume either. People say he did not show any real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character's character is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength. She is quiet while part of the movie and only her eyes and body transmits her emotions. Example: The scenes during the fall of the city and when the looting was injected. If you say that she does not act well in this movie, you're not looking! Paul Muni shows that he can act as well. Her character is not a favorable person to me. He never saw it for what it is, until the very end of the story. A sweet love and dedication to his wife and mother, with her own special beauty. One of the greatest of all, the beauty comes from, like a shovel. <br /> <br /> If you find a chance to see this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best films of golden age in Hollywood created.
