The first installment of this notorious horror series featuring a woman being kidnapped by a black-clad band gang that tortured her for several days before finally killing her .It is beaten to violence, sharpening around in the chair endlessly, having finger nails it pulls, the bowel is thrown into it, hot water is boiled on it and ultimately it's eye punk with a needle (really sick and nasty scene) .The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to do it as real tails Possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a muffled movie you can get without committing murder on tape. Of course some of the special effects are rather poor, but the idea of ​​making a mourrend is very gruesome I also saw the "Flowers of Meats and Bloods" which are more gory and sadistic, but less disturbing.Anyway, this one is a must-see for horror fans!
