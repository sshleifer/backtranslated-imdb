Good action and interesting plot. When you saw the original I must say it was an exciting improvement and showed more in the movie. Good to throw .. significant acting .. although it would be nice to see some more expansion of the action stage rather than the background history. Fun movie to watch and keep you alert all the time 7/10 is a right vote I think!
