Hilary, evocative, confusing, brilliant film. Remind me of the Bunuel L'Age D'Or or or the Holy Mountain Jodorowsky - lots of strange characters mucking on and looking for ..... what is it? I laughed almost all the way at all, while keeping a peripheral eye on the reactions and occasionally undergoing reactions to the audience surrounding me in the theater. Interest in and in, from the beginning to the bowel and poisoned poison all the way to the end, if it was an end. I just want I could remember every detail. She hauled me sometimes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, though, I have only the most positive recollections in this movie. As it does not seem to be available to take home and look, I suppose I'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes my way again with her big slip show (and subsequent "What is it?" Screening) ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after being involved in a car crash rather devastating, so I was a little dazed at the time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind They look at professional athletes talking and retards them in superhero costumes and glades in his appropriate Q-setting environment, elegantly clad girl rising from the floor like a magnificent DADAIST wet dream. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement about life as we know it? Of course all EXPECTS art must be just that. I rather think that the truth is more obvious in the absence and in the negative space. What you do not tell us is what we must be inferior, but is far more valuable than the mistakes that others eat us day out and day out. Instead of one "WHAT IS IT?" Over 5,000 cinemas such as "Titanic" or "Seattle's Seamless" (shakes, gags, lakes). Thanks, Mr. Glover (In addition someone pleases to look on the screen or at the big show it's Slide - smart, funny, original, and incredibly hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
