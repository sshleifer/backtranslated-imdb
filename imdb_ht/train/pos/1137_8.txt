It's very funny. You know, just like a supposed comedy. It also looks very good, as a spectacular Hollywood should be. So what more do you want? Howz on a very good Sally Fields. It's so much better here than anything else I ever saw it in, and it looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why it's a star. Those Eyes! Like a movie star silent, but better. In fact, all eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be an actor of soap bad TV with my girlfriend. We would do the thing that you look real soon from an eye to the other from your partner. They do not at all in Dish soap. Great. The eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> There are many terrific performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reproduce. There's a whole workshop going on with Kevin Kline on how to swap very much subtle. Got that? Yeah, it's damn good. So, Robert Downey, Jr. has been doing sumthin in a career in playing Slick, the Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and fixed, especially when it's upset. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, its natural distribution gives here a bit of delivery to a little zing. OK, there is no bump Whoopi, I heard it. <br /> Then there's the hair. Soap Dish was done at the end of the Big Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in their heads. They get bigger and sillier, just like you did. Yeah, we got photos. <br /> Soap Dish is better than I thought it would be, better than I wanted it to be. I'm sick of the movies that tell me I'm supposed to care about deep, self-centered, semi-talent egomaniacs, ie. TV soap actor. Savon Dish looks just like I'm laughing at 'em. Thanks.
