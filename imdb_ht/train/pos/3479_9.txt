Show this started out with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. And the show began to play short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby Doo, and Scrappy Doo. <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20-minute episodes in short episodes. Some of the voice actors have become available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became available. I think the voice of Velma changed after 12 episodes first, because the first voice actress played by Velma was available. <br /> And the network ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to do more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby Doo, and Scrappy Doo, because the ratings were high. So they did more shorts. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. Still it is a good show.
