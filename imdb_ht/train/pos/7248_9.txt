When I saw the exterminators in the first 3,000 years, I had no hope for that movie. Although, it was not so bad as I thought. It's kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, and cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who is also responsible for stories of meat meat meat. You can also see other links for Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy's role, and you can see that the kid in Paura in the Dead Living Dead (Living Dead AKA Gates of Hell) as John Robbins and the Canibal Apocalypse as Role of Mary's brother. Quite fun movie, with some dull parties.
