This is a movie that the mainstream market will probably never be accessed as it does not exactly give the viewer easy to watch. The story of Troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a movie night Friday yet he has his own unique corner and I found that he was entertaining. There are bright moments given that the film was shot down like a low budget, such as when Spike inhales the aerosol. However I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest he made me pass most of the movie trying to work it out. And I also did not like the fact that most of the movie was spent with two friends talking and not really "action". It's a very complex movie to watch and that's what makes it appealing.
