This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. <br /> If this movie was directed by Larry Clark, then this story about a school shooting could probably have been shown in the eyes of the killer and all that had led this person to go crazy in place first. <br /> Instead, the draw focuses primarily on the consequence of a school shooting, and how it victims survived. <br /> I've seen occupying Phillips in other films before, but the performance of this movie is by far, its best. The only other movie I've seen with Erika Christensen is "swimming fan" that makes me almost unwilling to watch this movie, but it turns into a very good performance itself. The few movies I've seen that were actually able to make me cry. Believe me when I tell you, that does not happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there too ...
