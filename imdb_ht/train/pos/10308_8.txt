Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie sure was better than what they did, "Oh, God". I was totally engrossed with the LMAO all the way off. Carrey was perfect as out of anchorman's dripping style, and Aniston brought in his party as the frustrated girlfriend of his usual well-played performance. I, for one, does not consider it to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the record cabinet to think he could never keep his life story. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that keeps the events in his bathroom humor: I rolled on this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this best comedy.
