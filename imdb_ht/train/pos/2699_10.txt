There are other reviews here so I do not need to tell how big it is or what it's about ... My point is: I've heard about this broad movie ago, before it was shown. I can not even remember HOW, I just knew he was in the internet. Distributors have gone down before it ever hit! For months I moped and complained. Please note that this page has a link to this movie and only the branded area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alfa Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know it's PAL format and has changed the text on the screen in German and has a little bit of narration at the beginning that was also armed in German, but as hilarious and farmer as this movie is, it really only does it funnier! If you want to view this movie and you have a place nearby that makes its conversion worth its value! It costs about twenty dollars or so to get to the U.S. from Germany. Believe me, it might seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you're entering corny b-flicks you'll be blaming money left and right getting your conversion for your friends!
