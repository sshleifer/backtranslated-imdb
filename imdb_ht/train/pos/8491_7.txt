I saw this movie when it was new. Then I rented it to Japan after he was here three years old, fearing that I would cringe when I saw it in the harsh light of my expanding international experience. The movie jokingly surprised me and how accurately it shows the culture conflict between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not everything is really spot on, but the tone is perfect. <br /> I'm still in Japan many years later, and I continue to enjoy this movie for same treatment - but it's in the two places in the story. Interestingly, although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialogue was reduced to the Japanese version to cover up obviously second-hand delivery issues. <br /> I notice one review using this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what you can expect in a Japanese encounter by watching this film than reading any of the "serious" books on the subject (most of them were written in the 80s and funded by propaganda companies Japanese). <br /> Do not be fooled by dragging on the average rating caused by one-review review that, among other things, found it implausible that the Japanese would want to build cars in the US. (Of course, Japanese many factory factories have to be close to their customers and to avoid trading friction.) This is a very hot and humorous film that I would have been higher than it was for a few 80s clich√©s, such as the dancing around cheesy electronic music disco. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.
