I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent, and it had a good scheme. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an X-5 Escape, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "saving the world". And being hunted by manticore throughout the season that gives the series some extra spices. The second season though suddenly became somewhat odd compared to the first. The kidnapped conspiracy disappears, and the series loses a little bit of it to charm, especially because of the "strange" creatures appear. Do not get me wrong the second season is good, but with a little bit of the "manticores". However, they managed to return to a new plot promising in the episodes close in season 2, in which I had much to expect to see more. So I really want to be able to start making new episodes. With James Cameron behind this he can not go wrong. So, as a conclusion I would say it's a great set, however I still hope for a third season!
