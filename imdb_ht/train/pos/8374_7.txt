OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever to make but she sure was fun. Brothers and I always act out scene once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow in the dirt and pop it in. .. enjoyable all the way until the end, but a concept great. This is a movie that one has just forgot about critics altogether and just enjoy. Trial is victory for Jox robots.
