I recently had the pleasure of seeing the Big Bad swimming in the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say it is the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to write a comment / review. This film has been very well-directed and combines a script that has realistic dialogue, excellent acting, and an inspiring message. Ordinary lives come together in an adult swimming class and become extraordinary in a celebration of diversity in life. This is perfectly illustrated by the prints in the first minute of this fascinating movie where we see only the feet and torso of people in various forms and sizes enter a pool of water. This brilliant film is directed as the actors are placed and positioned in fascinating scenes, which keep your attention and imagination.
