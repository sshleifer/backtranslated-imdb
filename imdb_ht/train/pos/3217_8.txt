Kurt Russell is so credible with the action for non-stop that he thinks about it afterwards to realize that there was honest-to-kindness important terms [to overcome fear of the Stranger, learning to rise above the early conditioning, the force love and friendship can bring, etc.] to the storyline. This is so rare for a 'guy action flick' that I [who thinks most A / A is not violent] liked the movie and was recommended to every guy I know ..... it's a shame This one was neglected because by right it should have been one of the biggest action-packed box office action - it has something for everyone without spending credulity or losing momentum almost without stopping action. I'm afraid the answer to it does not become a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it. Anyone under 20 probably has not seen only violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi-layer multi-themed gate or do not care about it. This movie can convert anyone who avoids A / A as stupid violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents it or sees it in a list of cables] to see this movie it will be more likely to get it going with him to other flicks stocks.
