This Columbo episode is probably noted more for the director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his early films. It should look for Jack Cassidy's role as the murderer who killed his partner in writing to keep his life. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his match of Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who makes the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be harassing store in general store / widow that would blackmail him for money. Instead of losing more money, he killed it. It's very fun to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's Falkalite as Columbo made him look after watching this episode repeated over the years. Today's television forget about the success of the year is that people want to look their show again and again if they love their characters. It's not about who made it, how and why, it's familiar to Columbo with his lucidity that high notes and viewers like myself.
