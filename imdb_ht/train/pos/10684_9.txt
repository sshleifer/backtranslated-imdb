In watching this early work DeMille, he once again strengthened me that DeMille earlier was far superior to the end of DeMille. His attention to the use of light in the scene is remarkable. His rally is very good, allowing much to be said in the space within an hour or so. He is a pity that he was not as intuitive about the style of his later film as he seemed to be in his silent film. This was the first movie in which I saw Cleo Ridgely. It was remarkable, well-restored and yet transmitted a great spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The finish is wonderful.
