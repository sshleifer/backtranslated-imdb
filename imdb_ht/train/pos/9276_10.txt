The US Department of State would not like to see this film, because they have a beef and the Iranian Govt. However, it shows us just how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the movie, which centers on the battle of women have equal rights in the simplest of terms: the ability to watch a football game in the stadium, which is prohibited only for single audience. The film is hilariously funny, and in and in itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie very much. Five girls try to enter the border police at the ticket gates in a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The subsequent comedy is too funny to describe, from the bus trip to the stadium, the interlocutor of the police and subsequent detention of the girls, to the resulting end. Do not miss this classic movie. It must be seen. One of the best films I've seen in years.
