An excellent illustration of one of the most important aspects of that era. I liked the visuals - very tight for a story connected to a graphic novel. <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this, he came across very well that someone was hardened by his work (which he did not completely choose for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. He does better to see what happens. Do not want to spoil the scheme - but you will see this movie if you are someone who wants more from a movie than the normal shot up format / Gangster action. (It is violent though.)
