I saw this movie when I traveled to Brazil. I found it difficult to understand Brazilian culture and society because it has many regional and class distinctions. To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something in everyday life in Brazil much. On the other hand, it is sometimes somewhat more than dramatized. And that's just the negative comment I have about this movie. It's sometimes too much, excessive sex, too many people kill and excessive cynicism for a movie. The director was able to film some things a bit more subtle, it would make the movie more effective. Despite what I liked the movie and how the story unfolds itself. Characters are complex, and many like real life. Not very American actresses and actresses who have a lot of cosmetics, but those who might be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the movie realistic, even when the story is not convincing.
