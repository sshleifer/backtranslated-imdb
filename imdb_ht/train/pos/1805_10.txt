I just saw this film I saw first time when I was 7 and it could just be remembered in the end. So I watch it like, 10 minutes ago, and (I may seem like a baby as I'm 12 ha ha) I started to cry in the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was especially sad for Anne-Marie because she said, 'I love you Charlie' and also: 'I'll miss you Charlie', just make me really cry. It has to be one of my favorite movies ever, it's just a movie well worth watching. WATCH IT ha-ha, all i can say xd <br /> <br /> but i love this movie, it's a true classic. <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
