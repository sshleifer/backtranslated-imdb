Is Jim Jim Thompson? It is hard-boiled noir and the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. There are rare detectives in his work - just losers, psychotic and short-time artists. This film has Thompson nailed - "If God made any real mistake in this world, he was giving us a willingness to live when we had no excuse for it." Each character in the movie balances on the edge of a razor between realizing and creeping realism. There are sleazy, conniving Tonton Bud, played by Bruce Dern and Spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heart-wrenching performance as Kid Collins, an inexpressible, shy old fighter that's more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is the faulty, femme female femme that we can not properly figure out ... It's not your normal movie movie, nor is it designed to be. After my sweet nuts, along with Grifters, are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
