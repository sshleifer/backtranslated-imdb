A brilliant portrait of a treacherous (Victor McLaglen at Oscar winning performance) who is hurt by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA Rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward while Sin Sense Fine Rebellion. Scenes showing battles and crowds are very realistic, focusing on the despair of people. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford superbly creates a quiet and tense atmosphere, reinforced by the blur illustration and the illusory of the Irish landscape. Max Max's dramatic music is added to the fun of cinemas. Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay, nominated for best photos. This is one of the Classic Hollywood.
