This award winning academy can be classified among the greatest in the genre. Told completely without dialogue, it is a visual treatise on a boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly putting it into a bowl then going to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window overlooking . After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, coming in to the window and heading slowly to the bowl. The fish apparently knows something that happens and gets excited. As the cat comes near the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat catches the fish, drops it back to the bowl and exits the window it came in as the boy does not know what happened, come back. This was amazingly filmed with real creatures; How Cousteau got these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I just wish this movie was available now for people to see; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it remained unforgettable.
