I saw this first movie when I was a kid and fell in love with her at once. Along with some of the script is humiliating the right hilarious: "You son of a thousand miles". at about 3:00 am once and just started. Television companies need to show a little more respect and put it on Sunday's first day so that everyone can get a chance to see this fine job.
