Strange amazing gothic horror bell that will be loved by House Hammer in the horror fans of the world. Appears to be an exciting take on "Beauty and the Beast". It is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well-acting when taking into account the genre and era. <br /> <br /> Cats, castles, horse cuts, rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods, proof that no one had a Brazilian in the 70's, and more bodily fluid than you could shake a stick in, what more can you possibly want? <br /> It certainly shines on my Sunday afternoon!
