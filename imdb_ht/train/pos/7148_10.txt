This movie is one I recommend. It is about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) who is imprisoned for a crime and sent it to Camp Green Lake, the boy's detention centers. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamond. While he, she meets other boys in the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Kalma, X-Ray, and ZigZag). All of them are digging, not 'building charactor', but to find the barbarian Kate Barlow treasure. Throughout the movie (and books) Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5, because, I'm very picky when it comes to books in movies, (I want the movie to follow the book exactly). But still he did real estate.
