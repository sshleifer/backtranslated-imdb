This was really a great movie. I liked Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very enjoyable actor who is very enjoyable to watch. Chemistry of the team was once got things together was spectacular, it just went to show what you can accomplish when unitedly united as one and one purpose. This team returned from the brink, having multiple lost seasons to have just about everything. I love movies like this as they really are very inspirational. <br /> <br /> On top of that, Dennis Quaid's character gets a place in the big leagues. You can not do anything but the roots for this guy. It just seems like when someone is supposed to do something, they will do that. Things that just happened to fall and do everything to click. <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think about the fact that "nothing is impossible."
