"I was looking at the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," proclaimed one of the main characters of ABC award winning television show "Lost". The series can be summarized as a drama story about a group of survivors crashing aircraft on an unknown island, but that could make the show a bad one. "Objects" follow a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, with each other, and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is not an ordinary island, either - and that they can not be alone. <br /> <br /> My first fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved unfounded. The narrative sounds naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. The island is an all character on its own, and understands this comment you would have to see the range for yourself, which only goes to show its originality and magnitude. <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have been revealed, and they're full of strong episodes. I only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit, but then fortunately returned to admirable form for the episodes. <br /> If I can recommend a TV set you should follow right now, it would certainly be this one. If you love excitement, adventure, character driving history, a very strong cast and crew, beautiful places, and an island that looks more natural than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start the start.
