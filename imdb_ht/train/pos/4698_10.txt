Just like wine, "dangerous Johnny" gets better and better and everyday. This clever, witty, well-acting film can very well stand on its own - but as an imitation of the gangster genre, it's really exceptional. In fact, it's quite obviously the best movie of its kind ... the funniest parody of crowds and even the corresponding period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to realize when its main competitors like primitive, vilg and dull pseudocomedies as the "Jane Austen Mafia".
