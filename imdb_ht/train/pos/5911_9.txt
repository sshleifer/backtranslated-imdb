Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was a hobbyist on Terrytoons, then on Paramount Studios drawing, after that, was a director of the 1 & 2 fritz cat with great traffic? Well, this is Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racism, but good. The film takes place in Sware Harlem (No, duh, it was a working title.) But with a twist that turns into a lamp in a Disney movie, Song to the south. <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry White) and The Preachman (Charles Gordone) hastened to help their friends, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escaped from prison, but stopped by a block and wind up in a shooting with the police . While waiting for them, Randy says Pappy's Pather (Scatman Crothers), as she starts telling Randy a story about "three guys, I've known, just like you and your friends." Pappy's story said in animation put against live action photos and footage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a man who turns it into a brothel. Arriving at Harlem, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox found that not all he did was to be. They meet a man called Savetz Simple, a revolutionary revolutionary leader who claims to be "cousin" in Black Jesus, and that he gives his followers "the power to kill white". In a flashy performing performance in his "church", Savior acting out being robbed by the asthma symbol? represented by John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon images, before asking for their parishioners for "donations". <br /> <The first rabbit woke up against Madigan, a racist officer officer and white homophobic police and Mafia bag, who showed contempt for Black Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated meeting and they (he believes they are not worth it). When Madigan finds that Rabbit took him, he and his co-coats, Ruby and Bobby, lead to a nightclub called the "Cottontail". A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped in his drink. Madigan, while under the influence of drinking his clamp, then maneuvering in a sexual bondage with a stereotypically gay manishman, and then pushing into clothes that women were representatives of the racist archetype, decorated in a racist party, and finally pushed out the rear of the club where he discovered that Ruby and Bobby were killed. <br /> And then retrieve it from his addiction to being drug, shoots his gun around random, and are shot to death by the police after shooting one of them. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent's boxer hurry from the boxing arena as he blows. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaped while being shot by various white cops, but managed to make it alive. This movie was controversial at that time of release, and was re-edited by the director several times under title, Street Fight, which is evident, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary on racism on the streets. In fact, this film has the same topic as the documentary. The result of Bryanston Pictures, the movie distributor and the original Tobe Hopper Classic, Texas Massacre chain, goes out of business. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanston took Bakshi's production. Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. The animation was scary at that time, the plot makes sense, and it's actually funny too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: 9/10
