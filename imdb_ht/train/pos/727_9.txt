One of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun. There really was a lot of clever jokes at her. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and "I hate high school" themes, the film does not all take it too seriously, that's what's great about it. <br /> I first saw the movie in the Spring of 1980, and I've seen it again lately. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me kind of nostalgic. <br /> Just as I said, this film does not assume that seriously and not pretentious as other young fare in sixty, eighty, and nineties. And talking about it, it's not really messy or disgusting either. Only PG rated. This is rare for a movie in this category. A great classic cult and a really incredible capsule.
