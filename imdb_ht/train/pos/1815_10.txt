"Is Spoilers * <br /> <br />" All Dogs Going to Heaven "is a big movie I've seen it in 1989 when I was two years old .. I did not understand it well but I've seen it I loved the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are "let me be surprised" and "Soon you will come home" .. These are the only wonderful songs that bother me 'on this movie is Charlie dead ... When I was my little sister could not even watch this party .. Other that this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Me in the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around the sky .. The beautiful sky of the movie and the "timers" are very smart. I love itchy, in fact I have 3 dachshunds in my own .. They are so beautiful. <br /> Overall I love this movie and suggests everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
