I thought that this movie was a better than the most crucial films to give it to credit. Even if it has partial confusion in the plot, it does not significantly interfere with your understanding of the movie. That being said, If you do not open to more liberal political policies, then this probably is not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were exceptional. Each character has comic moments and the audience of the Tribeca Film Festival has laughed at the whole thing. I thought the satire was a tad on the top of a particular area, but that's intentionally done. Jan Cusack is right in that although it's set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
