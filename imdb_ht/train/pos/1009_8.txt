Reality: Stargate SG-1 is a series of cheesy sci-fi series. <br /> There is no reality escape. How much do you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG-1 remains a set of cheesy sci-fi series. <br /> Stargate SG-1 to borrow and steal mind briskly. Special FXs are not as impressive as they can and the action will not blow you out of the chair. Or, that's where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit he can get, for every episode or stolen idea, I think you can count in at least one sci-fi movie cheese that is actually worse than a TV episode one hour. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still were much better than most movies. <br /> And could keep that quality at all the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further that's what Stargate SG-1 does special. <br /> I'm very picky with my selection. I followed perhaps one or two television series at most and I kept very high standards that made me more surprised when I found myself holding. So, for those who decided to brush Stargate SG-1 yet another sci-fi monkey show, do not. Wood with it and you will see what I'm talking about.
