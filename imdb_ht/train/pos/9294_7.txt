Before I begin, I should point out that I know the editor of this movie. We've never met, but we belong to the same fancy (things that came before message boards), and we talked about the phone, so I have a bias here. Anyway ... <br /> Somehow, it's ironic how while the "Rat Pack" culture in the late 50's and early mid-60's made a comeback in the mid-90's, This movie, from the son one of the original rat package, and made in a similar way, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not wild this (he gave it a mixed review, as I remember). And while I do not think this is the greatest film in the world, and I'm not a fan of the rat, or "drinks," culture, I think this is worth seeing. For one thing, this looks stylish, and moves right along. For another, basic performance is indeed good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly stopped here as the top gangster comes back from a sanitarium, and he has an edge to him. Jeff Goldblum goes back to the slowly ironic performance he gave on his pre-blockbuster days, like the big chill. And while Ellen Barkin is only required to wave in this film, she does it funny. Admittedly, it's not a big movie; The dialogue is mainly made up of puns, and a lot of them do not work (like all the "Zen of Ben" speeches). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here. Still, I was entertained, and if you like gangster films, you might be too.
