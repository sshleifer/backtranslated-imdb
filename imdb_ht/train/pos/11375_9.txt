This film tells an amazing story with stories and compassion. From the careful attention to the crime scene of mental health the lead investigator, you will be intruding. It is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are great. Not too heavy. I recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history, too. How the police worked with the political party was what he was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The beautiful surroundings. It was a while since I saw this movie the first time. It does not diminish its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough of the imagination, well, you will see.
