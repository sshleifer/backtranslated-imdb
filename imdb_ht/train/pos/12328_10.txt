"Bread" is very stringent to conquer the conventions of horror movies in general and "night of living dead" in specific and is still invented. Production value is a little rough at times (it's a movie movie, after all), but never loses sight of its purpose to entertain. Hey - George Romero likes it enough to put it on the video clip "dead" video, laserdisc and DVD ... that should tell you something.
