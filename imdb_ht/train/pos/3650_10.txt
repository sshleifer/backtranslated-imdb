Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I was originally made - and cheated on - a VHS tape in this wonderful TV presentation. I was decomposing when I realized what I did since I was able to get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> Recently, I subscribe to digital cables, and while looking at the upcoming cinema, there's my surprise being a broadcast scheduled in the movie. This time, however, I made a copy of it to DVD so there's no chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> I finally got to watch it again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a little bit of prelude to this story in my first contact with "The Clock Pandora" came up with a reading book in the book on public radio. I just came to tune in the broadcasting station on my home route for lunch, and from the first installment, I was hooked. Every day, I was waiting with an anticipation for the next chapter for her. <br /> When I learned a few months after the book was broadcast on television as a movie, I made sure to clear my schedule for this event. <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another review said. That, in itself, is a rare success for TV movies. Second, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could be crashed and burned without a good throw for this essential role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame that we have not seen more of it. In fact, all cast members have made a superb job. My only complaint with the movie - with the book - was the interaction of the "terrorist conspiracy" in the arm of a private business plane with air-to-air missiles and having its pilot foot and firing down the plane suffices. Basically, we're talking about less than 36 hours of orchestrate and executing a plan like this one, and folks, that's just not realistic at all to give all the players involved. Also not realistic was how the small plane was affected by no one first, then two of its engines were blown. <br /> <br /> That beef aside, I enjoyed the suspension of buildings and found to be very credible how the reactions of foreign governments were described in the film, as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have an opportunity to see this movie, do not all mean.
