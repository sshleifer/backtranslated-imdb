I found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedy (Chris Rock) who died and sent back to earth in a white body in the middle of 50's. He does not realize that his behavior should change and he continues to act as he did before. It listens to rap music, singing together, and playing the stereotype party in a black city. The real humor of this film was watching issues in which this behavior came to him with the black community.
