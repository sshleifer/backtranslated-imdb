This is the finest film ever faced with the subject of AIDS. It is a documentary about two people living with and dying of this disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, and incredibly moving. Above all, it is an amazing true love story. Make sure you have a few tight ready before watching this movie --- you will need them. Extraordinary.
