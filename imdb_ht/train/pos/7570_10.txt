I recently bought under the Dreamcast very underrated and went to town to find some games to use them on. I bought Soul Calibur (A Classic) and then I stepped across the Resident Evil Code Veronica Resident. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and played Res Evil 3 many occasions, and I was impressed with all of them, especially no.1 down to history has a classic. But none of them 3 come anywhere near the Dreamcast attempt at Brilliant Gory Gamer. If it's just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so enthralled on a computer game by the way this was enthralled me. , the story carries out in the 2nd story of which Claire Redfield searches for her brother (Chris - from the 1st story), who is supposed to be missing under the plot of the demonic umbrella society. Little is known about this society except the fact that you even if you destroy them 3 times in the previous stories. So help Claire, with the assistant of Super Brat Steve, u have to unlock the truth in the real where your brother. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris, which if you manage to get that away without running out of the room in pairs. <br /> <br /> The controls are very slick and the movement of the realistic enchanting characters, when the character warns danger, he / she faces direction it will come from. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> Overall I gave this 10/10 game because it is simply the game of the year, games of the decade and the best game in the world stop full !! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
