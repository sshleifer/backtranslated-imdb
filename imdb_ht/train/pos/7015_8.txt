Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store a chance to surprise everyone. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spread to a chuckle that says, "Yeah, right." As you get more and more in this story, you can not figure this guy out. It's easy for people to control them. What is his motive? Is it from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to be good? It helps many we want it to be our auditors should we get controlled, of course. Hey, IRS, do you listen? (kidding, just kidding) <br /> <br /> The mash in the movie is perfect with lots of clues being ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Huge, repeated intense, focused on Ben and staying there. The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure it out and I did not see any indication (what is your clue, Willis?). Do not read the box in front of watching the movie DVD was the best way to go here. At the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well, it was obvious then. And, yes, it's on the head, but still a great story, especially because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith would have been nominated for a better Actor award. The rest of the cast was very good too. <br /> Yes, it's over the head and despite great acting and when you finally find all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong. What's the message? Believe me, you will not need too many indications to figure out it. I did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: No Sex: Yes, but nothing is excited about. Bland. Nudity: No Language: No.
