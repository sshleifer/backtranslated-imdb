The unmistakable exception of this film is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly wild and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone make it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a great human face has! <br /> The story is one odd and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in part (especially toward the end) but it is also unusual to touch and succeed on many levels. However, I felt the movie basically turning to Peter O'Toole's glowing performance and I certainly would not like it even half as much if he was not in it.
