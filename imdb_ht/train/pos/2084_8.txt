My main problem with the movie is that it goes on too long. Other then, it's very good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to marry in a row wedding. Luise Rainer is a servant girl who is married to Muni. They live with Muni's dad on a farm and are doing very bad. When it finally gets some money to buy some more ground, a drought strikes and nothing is growing. All stars in the north by Muni remain behind at first. When they leave and arrive in town they find that they have no work and they are worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but deciding it. When a lot of people begin to loot the city, the military show up and begins to execute people. Paul Muni has a good job and Luise Rainer won a second oscar for this movie.
