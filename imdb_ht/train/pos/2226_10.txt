I'm surprised at IMDb's low rating in this movie. With all due respect, its low rating is the IQ representative of those who rated it so poorly. They would rather see a movie with cheap emotions, a bigger budget, and more gore. <br /> <br /> First misconception by man is that this is a horror movie. It's not, neither the movie deceives you to believe it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It is for those who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com review is perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change-very rare day-it's something wrong and not worth it. <br /> I will reveal some deflators for the morons who said it was boring and didn 't make sense. Martha was brainwashing herself and experimenting on herself to be a mother caring while she really was a evil Nazi who would be killed without warning. The evidence is all of the pudding and the fact that at first glance, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a test toward the movie and writing. <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in range 6 on originality alone. I recommend this movie for people at the other end of the IQ scale - aka smart people - since this film is obviously being stuffed by people who would rather watch Freddy 's crying or nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos in acting as well. For such a low budget film, you are surprised that this movie did not hit your local cinema and the great direction, writing, and acting. Please do not be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. I actually recommend buying the movie since a first look on a rent will not do that justice.
