Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, it's more than make up for it with the on-the-top top-and-top interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. /> Particularly effective is when he meets Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. As Scott stands in front of a big window, sunlight a glowing coats on it; All you can see is his silhouette. Increased by Scott's voice, a ponderous roar, the effect is galvanized ... much like Marlon Brando's first stage in APOCALYPSE now. "The movie," indeed! <br /> However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays this gleeful generic throughout the film, it proves infection. To put it another way, "before" Scrooge is almost as charisma as "after," though it really should not be. That's what you might call the "Doctor Smith" effect, since Jonathan Harris uses a very similar approach when playing this role with many other Heavies (steps and screens). Actually, I also do not consider Scott's gladiator's rage a responsibility. But other "Christmas Carol" purist can. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
