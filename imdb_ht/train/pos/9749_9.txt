I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I definitely was not the least interested in the opera at the time but changed my opinion. I enjoyed this movie so much and I really enjoyed the opera ever since. I even bought several of his CDs. Who cares about his ability to act, he basically just played himself, which was adorable. It was so good, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to embrace her. I feel so sad for many who criticize her so stiff. It was so straightforward, did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. She deserves to respect and admire her talent. It will definitely be missed !!!
