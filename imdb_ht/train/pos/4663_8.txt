I saw the movie description on TCM and only let it run because I love both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was delighted to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional. Of course, it's seriously dating, but as a piece of period it is well worth watching just for the subtle humor of insight into life and form almost forty years ago. Now the problem is just trying to get it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I was well taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as their drive, and at Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the appearances hosted by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
