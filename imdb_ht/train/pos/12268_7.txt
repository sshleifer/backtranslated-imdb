Seven young people go to the jungle looking for a bear. All of them are sustained and viciously assassinated by a Vietnam Veteran veteran. "Infernal Trampa" is a very entertaining Mexican slasher who reminds me a lot of "zero boys" .The movie is fast-paced and has some good death scenes such as abrupt throat or ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there are many gore, so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.However if you're a fan of Slasher movies give this rarity a look .Mechanic horror makers are quite obscure (I've seen only "Alucarda" and "do not panic"), so This would be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10.Highly recommended.
