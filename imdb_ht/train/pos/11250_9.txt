Having just seen a perfect mini spy game in one go, one can do anything but one's doff hat - a better chef, which compared to other Le Carré ministers on smiley, there are quite different types. At the minister on Smiley, he is Alex's Guinness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, one can say. <br /> Here she is ensemble with important stories, as the lead actor, played excellent by Peter Egan in the episodes final, not charismatic at all. <br /> <br /> Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym, who does not lie, was devious and tells those people to hear, very well loved by everyone, big and small. The only one that seems to understand the interior itself is Alex, its Chekol occupant. <br /> Never have a car behind a spy, and / or betray, said best! After he follows his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn it into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what made him in 'a perfect spyware', as his Chekcake buyer called it. <br /> <br /> And, not following his life, we fully understand how difficult he is to get back to the right and narrow path, once you've flown over it. It trundles over, though he never finds any economic out of it, except promoting his MI5 spyware. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of fake information continues! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! In later years he is his son who has bail him out, again and again. But not by his father and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to jail, and his mother sends to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns happening that lies is the way to survive, not tell the truth. At first it overdoes it a bit, but quickly learns the right lies, and must be constant, does not change the stories from time to time as he says to those who want to listen to himself and his father. / Alexander Chechek Alex, expelled by Rüdiger Weigang, created, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existing informants, who provided the British MI5 with false information for years, and years, as the British did German spies that were active in the UK before and during the war - were caught on sending false information in Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves turned, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 people. Young boy playing Magnus in lesser years makes it beautiful, and most of them are more charisma than the older, little more cynical, and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as this is often the way we change into life, out of enthusiasm in grief, or indifference. <br /> <br /> Indeed well worth the money!
