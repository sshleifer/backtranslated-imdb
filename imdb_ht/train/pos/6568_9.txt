I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and that day always does. A simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight from gnome paperback. He was the most recognized actor again in the day. This should not keep the viewer out of giving it a tornado. Wayne Crawford star as the main character Jake Speed. Sure, it might bite at certain elements of the Romancing Stone, and Indiana Jones. But this film is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. I am surprised by too many people to know about it. It must have been covered by other movies in theaters back to '86. I watch it back then on cable TV. It might be difficult to get it from printing on both VHS and DVDs. I managed to find a DVD from eBay at less than 8 bucks! Cool flick.
