I'm going to go out on a membership, and actually defend the "Shades of Gray" as a good-show clip episode, which delved into the life struggle with the death of captain William Thomas Riker who fights a fatal terminal disease. > <br /> The scenes of the flashback sequences have been implemented well and the mood of Riker was in such time as he was revived his boyfriend's episodes such as "11001001," "Angel One," and "The Long Ladder Up." Tragic moments were marked as Tasha's death in the "skin of evil," as well as elements of heartbeat-pounding in the "heart of glory," "plot," and the aforementioned "skin of evil. " Riker also expressed courage under the fire to say some funny jokes like "An ancestor I was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode marked the psychological process of Will Riker under extreme duress. And, YES, I also favored in my opinion to proclaim "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original airwaves, my face was covered by sweat, wondering whether Riker would pull in it alive and live to see other great, galactic, outerspace adventures beyond the final boundary ... <br /> Of course, in the next year, I seem to have formed a singular opinion in this episode in particular ... but if a premium should go for the "best clip-shows episode in the television story," then I believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect.
