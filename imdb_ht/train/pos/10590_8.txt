This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day but somehow did not get an audience. <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be totally new, but added a lot of history. And who can forget Pax, the cute guide dog in the series! <br /> <br /> Also, the stories themselves may be no better than the average series, the New Orleans settings, acting with the music (I remember commenting on the music note in other comments ... I remember that clearly) all works have a good TV set even better! <br /> <br /> Well you never know ... one day Paramount might just dig through her archives and drop it on DVD!
