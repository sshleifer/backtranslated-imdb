I had just about the worst day of my life. Then I stumble over this beautiful movie, watch it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a streetlamp. <br /> I must admit, I only watch it for 2 reasons: VERA-ELLEN LEGS. But it's really so much more. The plot is actually quite clever and creative knitting. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its delightful misunderstandings. And of course there's the ... LEA VERA-ELLEN. <br /> Only the unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) does not have the best video quality, and I've heard the same is also on release of Alpha. Light and contrast are somewhat too high, so a lot of scenes seem to whit out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can play with the TV controls you set to compensate. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back to '51. The scene sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling & joked creepy - sort of into a "Caligari Drill Cabinet" vein. <br /> <br /> As far as the romance goes, this is just perfect. Not boiling, not comparable, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable life will never be as good as this. You have them. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life is absorbed in the same way. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.
