Walter Pidgeon's major lawyer took a case of killing a pro bono, wins an accuser and discovered that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extinction ring reached the tallest eschelons of the city. Psyche does not conscientiously engage in an investigation, falls on the identity of the "unknown man" who directs the syndicate, and kills him. <br /> <br /> The trials engage when brass is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by showing off the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Though a bit short in urban gravel and long on speech, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir sugar less by style or structure than by its recognition of the ubiquitous corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the years after war.
