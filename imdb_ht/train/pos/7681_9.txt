Children's 'Sexuality' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I fear that any movie on this topic would jump straight to the stage of an explicit sexual nature in order to traumatize and disturb hearing lan. After having seen both 'Trade' and 'Holly', a movie moved me to actually see a change in international law. The other felt like a poor attempt at making my cries for five minutes and emotional music and the odd suicide. I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood water jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I have to praise the Holly for engaging the subtle but powerful and terrible conditions these children are unfortunately forced to maintain. 'Trade' was shattered between serious and stupid and scene involving the death of a cat coming after images representing the children being forced to commit some lethargy acts. I found this injection and at times offensive to the cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh I would not sign up for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> For anyone who would like to watch a powerful movie that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the movie ticket for the release of 'Holly'.
