"Rich In Love" is a tranny-of-life movie that takes the viewer to go on a bit original Charleston, SC family. Very romanticize, very well shot, well written and acting, "RIL" washes on you as a summer breeze as its unprecedented mixing breathes life into the characters that at the end of the movie you will feel like an old friend in the family. > <br /> A beautiful character-driven film from the director of "Miss Daisy Driving", "RIL" is a little darker "Travelers" that will appeal to most mature audiences.
