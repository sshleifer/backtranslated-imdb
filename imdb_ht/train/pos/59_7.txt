While I was the video store I was browsing through the single dollar locations and came over this little gem. I do not know what he was about to do but I just had a guts instic about it and Wow was I ever. <br /> <br /> History of the centers around two girls who just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia's rejection of the youth who is the only witness for the full assault and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet in the head by some miracle. They are thrown together by fate, they slowly start a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving over. <br /> I just hate her when amazing movies fall into the cracks. Because wow this performance does not occupy Phillips and Erkia Christensen we do not mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all an excellent movie.
