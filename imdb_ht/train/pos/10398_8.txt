Although time has revealed how some of the effects made this story of love and adventure still is special. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before you will be shocked by how many were stolen by later movie makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin shines in the movie. They loved the movie and enjoyed it as a touchstone for many other films and movie makers. <br /> I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this movie remains, because in the final 15 minutes the movie falls apart from the rhythm. Everything is running as if they suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more drawn then paint finish. He did not kill the movie, but it weakens it. Always looking at them requires anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a big movie.
