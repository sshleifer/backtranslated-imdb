A must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made Ramones in a home name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable station). This was the first and best of the American Punk Rock Cinema, and a classic classic statue went up with the Rocky Horror Picture show. Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars, but they released the album "Live In Budakon" just to make them superstar and too hot an item to be in a low budget film. Very good luck for the Ramones who were shattering from the underground punk world and the mainstream market (which sadly never happened until after the bandits broke). The group, Dee Dee especially, still does not film in the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get in Ramones show. This movie, like most classic, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones feet in the great day of glory. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. Another classic Allan Arkush film in a similar vein is to get crazy, featuring Lee Ving from the legendary Hardcore punk band band.
