The turn point of the "Matador" comes about halfway through the film when Danny, a sophisticated man from Denver, sat in the balcony of her Mexico City hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocked on his door, and he knew Julian, the murderer paid, he refused to answer. But was he really? Richard Shephard, director of the "Matador", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who shows no kind of salvation. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny in the Real Estate Case of Camino in Mexico City, she spreads the weight and tells her new friend what she really does for a living. Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it looks like it is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in front of the contract. Danny is a naive man who falls prey to the charisma and doled charm from Julian's most clever. It's not just some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friends to pay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It's the point that the secrets that tie together reveal in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against kind, making a great contribution to her irreverent Julian Noble. Just to look at him walking in the hotel lobby of his Speedo, he boots giving the right impression on his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the right part of this odd couple. Hope Davis appeared only in a couple of scenes to let us cry why he did not stay longer. Filip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the bonds between Julian and his duties. Richard Shephard is directing and working with his own materials. The music note is not Rolfe Kent and the movies scene of David Tattersall improves everything.
