I remember this series well. It was excellent - as strong and compelling, stylish and sexy characters ... and so different from everything else on offer at the moment - and now ... I assure that it also inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both Season 1 and Season 2 are available on DVD regions 2 in the UK. It is a treat to watch the series again. <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can find it on special at Amazon.co.uk
