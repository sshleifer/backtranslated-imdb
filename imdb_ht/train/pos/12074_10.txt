Joseph H. Lewis was one of the finest directors of noir films. This is probably his best. <br /> It's not some of the standard features of what we now call Noir movie. Though the Americans did, it puts entirely to England. He lacks gangsters. She lacks a fatal fat. It does not miss crime. <br /> <br /> Title characters answered an ad. He is very happy because he will make some money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up later days as the pawn into a scary scheme. Only a very strong person could survive such a disturbing disturbing hustle. And Nina Foch gives the essence of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement from casting against types: Ms. Foch has an elegant way. He has no screaming, cowering victim. It is actually a little glacier and patrician, quite impecunious. This makes his character plot all the more credible. <br /> Surely the most fascinating element is the cast of Witty Me Witty. It was (and is) probably the most popular for the good title character of the "Vanishes Ladyishes." It has a sweet and harmonious, easy way. But here it is far from a heroine. George Macready is excellent as her son is very troubled. All the cast, in fact, is superb. It seems that this famous and brilliant movie made almost by accident. Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he did. But he did it on a low budget. That's the thrill and charm of film noir, the real movie noir: It's tiny, compelling Lowlife, and, in this case, unforgettable.
