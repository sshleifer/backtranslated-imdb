As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as long as I can in my new religion. I was invited to attend a show in this movie with my son and other young men and women as well as families in our ward. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio in the historic village church located there. We had to have reservations at the Center for Visiting this film. Since watching my movie was limited to just a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. Only "full-time motion pictures" in the church I saw was "Legacy" and "Best of my years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. Earlier, interpreter missionaries had passed tissue that claimed that several people were deeply moved to tears in this film. I thought "OK ... but it took so much to move me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I found myself groaning! It truly is a very inspiring testimony and inspiration for the Prophet Joseph Smith. See her & believe in her powerful message!
