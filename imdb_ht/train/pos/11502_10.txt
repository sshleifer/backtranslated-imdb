As a forty-one urban explorer / photographer and longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my childhood, one aspect that has not really been mentioned is the number of exploration characters in the city of Carl undertook during series a. He always managed to find himself in a great abandon, sewerage or tunnel after another. Armed with only his trusty display (okay, so he had some darts at the thick thick around it) and his camera, he never carried any other gear either to protect himself or make the exploration easier . many here, I recently bought the DVD box set in the two pilot movies and subsequent television episodes, and they quietly reviewed all the shows. And although I remember seeing them back in the early 70s when they first revealed, it was over 30 years ago ... many of them seem new all over again. Campy, dating and cheese - but good and very fun. They just do not do things like these days. Now all regurgitated his turn with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter was sitting down to watch the episodes with me and she developed an appreciation for them (she's enjoying the genre). It gives me hope and confidence the series will bring on new generation fans for years to come.
