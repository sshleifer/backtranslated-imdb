When this first came out, my father carried it home-we were surprised by it- It was different from what we had seen before. I was looking for a specific film last night, and I found the "eye eye" again. The box will fall apart, and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it does not 'Find Nemo' quality graphics, it's still pretty good. This should be sold again - it's a landmark for computer animation imagery. Highly recommended! <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> The "Mind of the Mind" is a spectacular odyssey of time. Your journey begins at dawn of creation and moves to increase in people and technology. Travel to the world of abstraction and over of the future with computer animation animation imagery. <br /> <br /> The Mind's Mind joins the imagination of over 300 of the world's most talented art computer art and a powerful, original Soundtrack music. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible journey through "Eye to the Mind."
