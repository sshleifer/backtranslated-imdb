This movie contains some of the biggest comic dialogue and memorable quotes ever assembled in one movie! The plot is a bit lacking, but the delightful rabbits are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that are sure to please. As a form of cinematic art it is very fun; with great stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? <br /> <br /> comedic dialogue with time as this has long been undervalued, and it is very difficult to imitate. This is a good example of this 1986 knockoff in this movie: The Money Grow, and Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor comments and commentary views. Achieving real comedy comedy is an artist.
