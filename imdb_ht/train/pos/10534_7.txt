If this is a good movie or not, this movie should make, I think. He reminds me of "I Love Huckabees", a puzzling puzzling movie with Isabelle Huppert being sodomized by a young American in a muddy pond, in a sadistic-masochist style (?? !!!!). I hope the director will go on leaving the border, as if I felt the choices Vincenzo Natali did, was not always subtle (some of the scenes were malheureu type "tarte-Ã -la-creme", as a slapstick kids), talking about script and cinematography ?? The color of "cubes" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprising, than the ancient films of Natali.
