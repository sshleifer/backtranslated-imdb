The latest film of Lucas' legend is a lavish, spectacular-looking producer. It is often considered to be the ugly butler of the original trilogy, but I think it is a tooth above IV episode (and just a tooth below Episode III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best movie legend in 6-part. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a grandamely fun movie. It is not a movie that has a start, climax and finish; The film mechanism operates with one purpose in mind: bringing Lucas' universe closure. There is a time of finality attached to the whole thing, making the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced to old people face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and solo are a nice romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is Luke's inner conflict (and Vader) which gives legendary skull. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still very noticeable, with film themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption. I'm glad Lucas eventually dropped the idea of ​​performing episode VII, VIII and IX, because this movie is a great bookend of a long, fascinating and captivating legend. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the style of the most beautiful.
