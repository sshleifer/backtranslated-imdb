I wanted to see off since the day I heard of it, which was sometime last year. Anyway I got to see today, and when the movie started I thought it started rather weeks but it got better after 10 mins or so. I thought that the film was very good. but the thing I did not like was how the killer was created, I thought just before I rented that it would probably suck just like Urban legend: final cut, I almost killed it. especially everything in UL final cut needs to be improved. Cut is 100 times better than UL: the final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and scene of death. The Killer Assassin MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> I give off an 8 out of 10
