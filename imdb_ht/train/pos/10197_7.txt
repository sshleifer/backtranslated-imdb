Well it was a long year and I went down to review the final movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) is placed second in the recent Metro Film Festival. As expected, he did not do well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common movies especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies. quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English playing out of the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a great job both as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. It was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that were needed for the movie. Also doing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. He did a great job describing Bikay, Duroy's sister. I hope to see him in many more movie projects in the future maybe advancing in other ways. I think the fact that this movie was in his local dialect really helped him. Some of the camera shots in the movie have been doing very well. The scenery was made even as if I felt that if a less effort would have to look completely different. <br /> In the theme of the story I feel that the writers could have been delved more in the lives of the youngest characters in the movie. I certainly will not raving about the story of this movie.
