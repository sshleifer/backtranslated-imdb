This is a masterpiece of B / W 35mm film. The movie makes you see an unusual way to start the day at 7:35 am at a bar and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. The strangely short, gets you into a complex story using lots of small elements, and the stage step makes you realize that something is not entirely right. It expresses much, making your adrenaline go high with subtle details, and it is incredibly understandable by anyone, not only the critical movie experts. <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. Do not let that hurt you. It is really worth noting anyone, not just experts in the genre. <br /> <br /> Is not really much more said, since the movie just lasted 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just watch it online and I could not understand why no one has spent a few minutes in post a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Really worth it. 10/10.
