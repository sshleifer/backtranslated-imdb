His name is Joe.A. long fighting starts against the man.But then he manages to spray his eyes and mouth and bug insects, which will kill him if he will not get help soon.It ties him up and makes Joe subject the same kind of physical and mental attack he used to be earlier. The Hermitage (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial off-Broadway play from 1982 by William Mastrosimone.Farrah Fawcett, which sadly losing his fight with cancer last year is terrific as Marjorie .James Russo, who has played the attacker also plays in the play, is convinced as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry.James Avery is seen as security guard.She has a Golden Globe nomination.This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you. He asks a question is justified revenge. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
