The critics did not like this movie. He bombed in the United States and as a result received only a limited show in Britain. That was a great shame, because it represents British rather than American humor and should have been shown in Britain first. Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convinced Russian. Ben Chaplin is Dustin Hoffman's character from 'The Graduate', and 'Anniversary Girl' has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of the classic 1960 (despite being a totally different story!). <br /> It changed sneak a number of times from comedy black comedy adventure adventure - but it's memorable, moving with a weclome breath in fresh air compared to the blockbuster budget mega budget. Spirit open!
