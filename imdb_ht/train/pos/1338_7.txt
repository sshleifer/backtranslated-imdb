The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to lack of quality and imagination of movie directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai have nothing to stand out. CCCC has a lot of controversy due to the funding of the movie and this and does not really know what the movie is about producing good advertising and sales advance tickets for the film around India and abroad. The only information provided was that it was a suspense suspense. The film is now released in 2001 and the movie was amazingly good. The main draw is to do with surgery and well-handled. Salman and Preiti provide a good performance where Salman does not actually take off the shirt at all .. must have special effects !! Rani plays salacious wife but it's a little less demanding role than compared to Preiti who plays harassment that eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main drivers confirmed, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, have a solid on screen and screen (apparently) screen. Salman Khan plays excellent a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity that has been exploited as a wannabe comedy in his other film as it is well underrated in the Mumbai movie industry partly with his films was chosen. Rani's characters do not know Preiti is a whore until the end ... this is kept in hand with the rest of the family ... the rest you should find out how it will ruin the movie if I told you. The songs are all picturized quite specially dekhne walon and songs in the main titles. Other actors support a minimal effort, but Salman loves family. Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the movie subject taktfully ... I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!
