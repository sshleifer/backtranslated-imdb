Eytan Fox did it again: moving the viewer's heart into a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. The film also succeeds in describing so perfectly with the subtle atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv. <br /> I was there a month ago and it is all there: the form, the relationships, beat the city, the chaos, the shock of utopian spirit of the most light-hearted, blithe and subconscious megacities ever. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommend: it's a journey for the heart and the mind, and an interesting perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. <br /> <br /> Benefits Notes: There are central gay drawings in the movie. If you do not think you are too gay-friendly, prepare to challenge and finally see it as "just love". (and do not worry: the hot chick too!)
