Star Pickford and Tournament Director - along with his favorite cameraman and assistant Clarence Brown to make the correction - bring beautiful beauty and intelligence to the history of the poor, isolated Scottish Islanders - the same territory that Michael Powell would be twenty years later to its first success. Windy and waves, silhouettes fall off of lovers by merely complementing the story, are the story of struggling against difficulties. The actors bring the dignity of people proud of their role and Pickford is brilliant as his character struggles with his duties as head of the tribe, caring between comedy and thoughtful, here and his father's island bullwhip traveling wayward in church, having sat and His guest's bat in his hand as a stick, discussing his girlfriend, played by Matt Moore. <br /> Look at whether you can pick out future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried, but failed.
