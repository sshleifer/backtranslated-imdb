What a nice movie movie movie movie. The story tells of a girl five year old girl who lost her father and found it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can relieve them happy .What all the spectators hoping to become concretized. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the girl's mum, as she was like the nanny in "Jack and Sarah", worth seeing if you like both Samantha Mathis and Joy; year worn jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a delightful grandmother in this sensitive and enchanting film acting. Jodelle Ferland (little five years old) is good with a most convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human goodness that is clearly illustrated and clearly is always all around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" Give us all hope, not to realize that there are a lot of lovely people in the world and lots of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
