"Moonstruck" is a beautiful little movie directed by superb story teller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). The movie is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture, has a touch romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy. One thing I liked most about the movie was the relative relative to the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively odd for most of the film, and Cher ... well, Cher still looks a little odd .. <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie, and easy to recommend. <br /> <br.77 out of 10
