Dark Angel is a cross between the New Huxley brave world and Percy's love of the Ruins - presenting the future not so far as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once one swallows the citizen that all modern technology can bring to a standstill by the "Pulse," it provides a fun landscape to explore the personality and relationship between the two main characters - Max (messenger to the black / bicycle messenger ) and Logan (the rich rebels). It looks uneven, perhaps a result of a variety of authors, but held together by the energetic, beautiful, and charming Jessica Alba, which looks like both strong and tender yet vulnerable and tender. I think Fox has done it again.
