Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing letters love each other without either one knowing which the other is. Of course, they work together and can not stand with each other. You can guess the rest. It is very well-acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty script, and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I find myself believing I saw Budapest! Everything seems so perfect with such dreams. A one of a kind movie. Do not miss it!
