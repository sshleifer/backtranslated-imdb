For those real movies, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect small alegor for the movie themselves. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science is made and captured with light projection from cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt, or it can attract good works. On one hand he blinds his mother, in the other it is used to blind blindness ("I can see!" Forced a young girl whose eye-blind eyes are projected). When Rukh / Karloff is himself poisoned by the unstoppable power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glowing on his hands and face as a seriously developing negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity seen on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights come out). There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as informed by the fact that everything that happens has been captured in the light-rolled space for millions of years, as the light from Andromeda was issued in which Galaxy at a time when the ground was still melting rock. <br /> <br /> There is the film passage of this new science juxtaposition with the greatest cultural machinery: those of the writer, in the character of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religions, the emblem of the sculptural figures of the Karloff Cathedral Cathedral explosion and his projectile / rifle weapon. <br /> One was asked here if this movie meant that look at what went to Germany at the time, and particularly in Riefenstall's use of films the year before promoting a diet that would certainly go on a lot of wrong: the triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately in the end, Mother (Purple Kemble Cooper) intervened, recalling Janos Rukh in the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more cinemas made you want to stand in the theater and call: "I can see!"
