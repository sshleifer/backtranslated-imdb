From the first stage, I was really excited. "I can say this will be awesome!" I thought. The act was so good, I felt as if I was facing-thrown on these people's lives. The music was too incredibly unsettling. The plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward (one could sense) towards some definite fate. The build was slow, but I personally loved that kind of thing, as long as the quiet tension remained on track and did not get demailed before it was ready to pay. <br /> So everything will be fine, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credit is rolling. "WHAT?" was all I and my movie night companion could say. If you understand the intentions of the director, end up smashing makes sense (for those of you who have seen the movie already, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden in filmcritic.com), but I can not help it say it's not was pulled in right. This <br /> <br /> <br /> This probably could be resolved with as little as ten minutes later in the pre-scaled material. In any case, it's too bad. Those ten minutes could make all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make films, you should know that crafting a history arc and the proper time is a great pain in the butt, and I certainly do not criticize this out of any kind of pedestal! ) <br /> <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece that gave up on it ended. But grass, I would take a blunted chef any day on an over-produced piece of dog-on-the-counter gift and too many digital effects (such as movies most of those days). . Some of the monster scenes let me confuse as if I should be scared or laughing. I do not know how to explain it, but there was a distinction Monty Python felt about this monster in his more "monster" form. Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie - I do not know, it still works for me in some crooked ways. I will never look like deer in the same way again! :)
