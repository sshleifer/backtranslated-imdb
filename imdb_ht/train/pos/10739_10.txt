Amazing documentary. See it on the original original and on DVD once a few years in the past year. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for a better Oscar documentary for 2002, the year he was released. No other documentary even comes close. <br /> It was on TV lately for the 5th anniversary, but I miss adding "the places they are now" to the end segment, except I kept that tony now working for the hazmat unit. <br /> I've seen criticisms on movie documentary from a few on this list. I can not see how this could be any different. They had less than 6 months to gather this and get it on the air. The DVD has more material and background. <br /> I also wonder that according to IMDb.com, the fee had no project in the four years since. What did they do?
