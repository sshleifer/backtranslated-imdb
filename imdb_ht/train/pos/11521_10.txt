Magician is a nice ride from start to finish, thanks to the great part of the magic produced by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any movie really fine, it's a journey through which the term is redemption and the results of dreams. I can not believe that this movie is SO hard to find - I would buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have not yet found an outlet.
