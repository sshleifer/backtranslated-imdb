I'm honest and yall, I was a junior high school then first sitkon revealed on ABC I did not think I would like it at all. But with Jan Ritter in it I felt that he had a little potential of it, plus they were something else with it I liked. The act was great, not a lot of terrible 2nd comedy line rated, John Ritter always brought his game when he came to comedy. This was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father never looked at sitcoms all, he just watched movies, sports, and law & order he actually sat down with me 3 brothers and sisters, my mother, and myself, and watch the show I think Jan Ritter was in it. I honestly think this would still run if John Ritter God rested his soul I wish he did not go away.
