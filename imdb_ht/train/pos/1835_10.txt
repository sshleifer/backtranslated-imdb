What an outstanding movie I do not have the word to describe. I do not know how coming the movie rating is 7.3 it should be 9.3 but anyways no one can make this movie and act by Akshay is just the second half exception of the movie making u cry and the movie has a really good finish unexpected that makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, I think twice it's fine to u. Anyways I like this movie and not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meaning and what you should do what I think this is one of the best movies in the Bollywood story. but I know people have such deferent choices. The only thing I do not like about this film is the music the background music is good but the songs are not good enough I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director but anyways we can not do anything about so ya.
