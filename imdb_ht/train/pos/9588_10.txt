When Paris is burning out, I totally dismiss it. I was not in the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought he was going to be campy and unusual. How wrong I was on this movie. I watched it after the movie came out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of pleasure and excitement. I felt as if I knew all of the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of gay culture. What a terrific job! I went online and found out what some of the original members did now but I could not find all of them. If anyone has any information about any of the CAST members please let me know. <br /> I hope to make another documentary. I love it
