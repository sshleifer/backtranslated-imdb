I generally find Loretta Young tough to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in any wrong way. But in this romance Frank Borzage romance, and even though he plays a low-self-esteem painter who puts up with entirely too much intimidation from Spencer Tracy's paramour, it's direct and honest and irresistible. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in Hooverville, very up-front of the romantic yet ideal and idealized Depression. Tracy, playing a wound, hard-to-take "regular guy" could be a terrible chauvinist and intimidated by today's standards, embracing his character's character and almost make him appealing. There are good work support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as it should have), and Jo Swerling's scenario is modest and ineffective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who still love to dramatize true love in lyric close-up, and Young. You sort of wanting to slap it, saying his characters are wise up, it's too good for this guy, but it's so devious and compelling, you contentedly watch the stories to play from a satisfying conclusion.
