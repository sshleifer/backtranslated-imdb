Critics are mute. This movie is funny and smart. I loved this movie very much. Why everyone hated this movie so much. I wish people would like this movie much more than they did. Ben Stiller and Black Jack are true comedians and put in a lot of work to make this movie. I do not see you people from making movies like them. So people should just watch it and not comment it. I like this movie. It's OK through it all. The parties have found it in mute but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller would like this because this movie has just been acting like King Queens show. But this is better than that. I can not believe this was rated so low.
