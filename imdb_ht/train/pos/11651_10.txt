LIVING FRIENDSHIP, in my opinion, is a very touched and dramatic type of sleep on the consequences of being anorexic or bulimia. Anytime Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself. It's kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about these things. However, I enjoyed seeing them doing things together as well as finding conferences by their parents. Before I wrap this, I would like to say, "If you ask me, when KILLS FAMILY truly shows you how anorexic or bulimia may affect someone's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to all who did not see it. You are in for some tears and a good time, so the next time it's on TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.
