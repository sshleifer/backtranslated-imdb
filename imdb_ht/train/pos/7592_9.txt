Just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, to get things straight, this movie does not pretend to be anything other than a solid action movie comedy. He does not aim to revitalize the movie industry with acclaimed Garner accreditation or he wants to be considered one. If you really want to enjoy this movie at all, I suggest you throw your critically-minded and longing for a good scheme because you will not find any of here. With that established, let's further in the movie. <br /> I had low expectations for this movie simply because it did not have a strong draw (Yes, movies, I'm mixing this movie as well), but I never expected myself to enjoy this movie very much. I liked this much more than Stephen Chow's flicks (which I found Kung Fu to hustle to be his best effort, it would have rated it a 9 as well). Action is tight and epic while shooting comedy on the right place. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think the action might be real, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie movie? There are many other movies (drama) that have already made it well, why create another? SPOILERS finished <br /> I'm not sure why you are reading this. Go ahead and watch it. Just remember, no thoughts - just look, enjoy, smile, laugh, and everyday once in a while (the movie industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or the godfather films, and sometimes to create movies that are best of the deck of dump. I do not say Koun Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that previous examples have, then again, if we're talking about Stephen Chow-ich comedy, this one of a top ten. <br /> <br /> Very recommended if you like: No brainer movies and really good action -Koun Fu -Death vision -Koun Fu and comedy -which heck, look at this. you will have a great time. <br /> 9/10 to throw in kung fu dunk. ^ _ ^
