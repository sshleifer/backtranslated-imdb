I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was right after Bay City rollers. I saw it coming to Family Channel one day, and attach it to daughter then my three year old. I would forget everything I would like as a child, the magic flute, the whit sweep, Witcheepoo's makeup. <br /> This show is Technology Developmental Technology. The Mayor is probably a McKayese Mayor's presidency, and everyone is a stuffed animal and scratches googly. But children like this. They would way, instead of looking at a guy working a puppet socker sitting in front of high-tech computer animation. There is a little slapstick, but there are no adult terms such as sex or death, and kids accept Jimmy's quick. Kids think it should be their own to bring a bag of smoke around and convince a man to be on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky he thought Witchypoo was flying over head. The old music, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really liked it. It used to sing "different is difficult, different is lonely" in the car. My daughter looked at this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and she's still one of her favorites. <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is at work. I really hope to try to keep the old taste and do nothing like computer-animation etc. I think a whole new generation would like Pufnstuf.
