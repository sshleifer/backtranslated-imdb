This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's work so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little over, the bones of the story are there although the more emphasis put on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined although it was a pity they were not a lot more cosmopolitan - perhaps the quarterly setting settings did not allow for that! I thought that some very daring risks were taken and filming; Maybe its because I had not yet re-read the book but it seemed very clear to me that the murderer came from the appearance of some shots revealing quite early on. Humor was much more prevalent in these early poirots. Sometimes it works, but I've found a lot of it rather heavy released in this episode (though I did smile to the line 'Lemon Line'). All along though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.
