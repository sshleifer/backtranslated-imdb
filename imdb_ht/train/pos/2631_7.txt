If the Lion King is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, the Lion King 1 and a half are the total opposite, full of whimsical and cheerful. The Lion King told the story from the Simba Lion's side, 1 and a half is out of view of Timone and Pumbaa, a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left his home because he could not dig tunnels without burying friends and neighbors with a warthog with an odor problem. The film is a little short of substance, but Disney does a great job of filling time with various drawings from Timone and Pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is singing-along that comes halfway through the movie, make sure you watch the bounced bug! Disney was released 1 and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really is not. It is just a different perspective of the king's lion, without all of the serious things that invade most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for voice work, without effort, the film could not work. The song, to entertain, and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub and a warthog.
