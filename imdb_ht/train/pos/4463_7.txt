A recent look at this INTERVIEW has given me encouragement to look at many of the MGM classic music from the forties and fifty soldiers. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a movie that is smaller than on the TOWN. The songs are not as good, nor are the chemistry between the characters. But the movie very well disguises classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene of the Hollywood Bowl, and Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it to the top, and then run down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, the scene is Best of the movie, though the scene in which Kelly Dance and Jerry Mouse is famous. Classic music enthusiasts will not doubt the music of the pianist playing. Shy then crogs, "I fall in love too easy," before you have his epiphany on whom he likes. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks nice with its mountains and air pollution-free (Can you imagine Hollywood in the wines, leaving alone the mid-1940s?!), And the music piano is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly has a Flair to create lyrical moments like these.
