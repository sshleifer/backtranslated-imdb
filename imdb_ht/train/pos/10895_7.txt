Surviving Christmas is an amazing funny movie especially considering the bad advertising when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as a obnoxious millionaire who pays the family who cares for his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. He then drives the crazy family and overindulgence for Christmas cheer. I was not a fan of Ben Affleck of the past (though I did like Daredevil and Paycheck) but here he is well drowned in that role. I also love Christina Applegate as the daughter of the family who can not stand Affleck's character first. Be sure to see where this movie will be but you do not care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas cinema.
