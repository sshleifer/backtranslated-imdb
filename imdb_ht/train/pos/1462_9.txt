In this documentary we meet Roger, the wealthy manager of a factory in china that pads and other trinkets sell and traded at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims the girls girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities they provide, but interviews with four of them say quite another story. The girls' lives are shown in stark contrast to the rare excesses of Mardi Gras herself. Filmman David Redmon would be honored to find excellent and rare footage in everyday life inside a Chinese factory compiler, and to land a reveal on-camera interview with the top of the US company that imports and sells shovels. The film is accomplished and clearly explains its purpose as a window of what lies behind these ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
