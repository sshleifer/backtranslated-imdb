Small and as *, many phobias. There are some great characters, fun full pranks and well put together teenage actions in this cut of the Amercan pie franchise. This feels like really old school. It feels somewhat like Porkys for 2000. Some great funny characters combine with some very funny situations to make this one a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Also the original cast is all but gone except for one, this movie I found really fun. Lets not get too excited, you have to take it for the teenager boobie comedy that she is, but for what it is, it's excelling. Characters are likable and funny, the girls are hottest than hell. Fun with the hilarious toys, and some things I have never seen before in the comedies, they make me cringe but laugh at the same time. So, ignore them and give this a run and see what you think. Do not expect the classic American pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and scrimp your attention for an hour or so.
