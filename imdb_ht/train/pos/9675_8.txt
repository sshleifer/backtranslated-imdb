Most people can say that if one had spent one night on Saturday watching a movie, you should be really bored. Actually, I just got back home from being out and turning on the TV and having it, "Paulie". <br /> I missed the open credit, so I did not know the name of it but I saw that it was Cheech Navy in it, so I naturally thought I was tuned to "Feast In East LA " When I saw him talking to a pale parrot, I was ready to reject this as the kind of flop movie shown late in the night. <br /> <br /> Happy, it was better than that. As you know, if you are not already Paulie lost and try to get back to her original owner. Looks like it takes years to find it. What should Paulie's advantage be actually a ten-advantage in ways. People who come across a common parrot and all they see are ways to make money or benefit themselves. <br /> While the Cheech Navy's character "is" to make money from him, he does not mean him. The dance dances and parrots are something that kids will find nice, I find them fun. Paulie, who's naive, learns quickly that not everyone is lovely. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man tells lies he will help her find her owner as she helps in researching the animals of her community. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to make a fool person out of the man in a demonstration to others in Paulie's vocal abilities. <br /> <br /> Through the film Paulie tells her story of the Janitor facilities that end up releasing, several other animals and finding Paulie's location. It's a touch reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the blockbuster scene scene should be assumed and not shown. This part can disrupt children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older children and adults who are a kid in heart. (END)
