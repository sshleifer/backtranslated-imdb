One of the most heart-warming films I've ever seen. The young girl is an amazing talent. His great performance (Doggie), the old man (king of mask), and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva). /> <br /> Love the music. The original Chinese dialogue increases emotional intensity in performance and history. <br /> This is a must watch - family enjoyable movie, although not for small children. There would have been rated DVD release even higher if the band was transferred best to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
