It's a good thing I rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site. It was a wonderful movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. Thrown in beautifully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good role playing. I would say to viewers who have not seen the movie go ahead and buy it. I miss it up with Christmas vacation. The movie was very funny and well written with Ben playing the executive's executive very well. Things to say and do is just how I would imagine someone with too much money to act. The movie is much funnier than Santa Claus and Christmas with their skulls. Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas that you can not buy love and money.
