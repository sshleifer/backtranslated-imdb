When I took my place in the movie I was in a cool mood and did not plan on changing it. But this movie is a powerhouse. I was all in sweat and needed a shower later. So what we have? Theoretically a coming in the great history of a Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It came to my mind as soon as the plot seemed very nice completely from "bend it like beckham", where we had an American girl playing soccer and spoiling the wedding of her sister. Here we have it transferred to a girl who spoiled her wedding brother does not kung fu. And we have a love story and a competition of course, too. After I accepted this, this really turned out to be an attractive, emotional drama and it shows some nice kung fu (not an expert, though). Leading actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's champion girl but he also delivers excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographical impressions here taking into account that this is his first film and that she has no education as an actress. Rest of the supporting cast is okay, good camera, Koun Fu intense. Sidenotes: - The Turkish male audience has shown respect for doing something right. - The audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were sorely beating up his brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese movie Koun Fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Dragon Layer) played master of the lead role <br /> If you get the chance to see this movie to make it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and I do not know if this works on the small screen too
