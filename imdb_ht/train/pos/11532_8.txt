Well, this was one of those films I kept on the chance, and it was good enough for me to record when he showed next time ... If, like myself, you enjoy many 80 cops flickering out a little out of the normal (ie not just another glut in generic suites) then I think you can enjoy this. When the bad guy eventually turned into man, he was definitely not what I expected to see! All in all, I would not go out of your way for this one, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it comes up, it has an hour and a half to kill, I guess. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.
