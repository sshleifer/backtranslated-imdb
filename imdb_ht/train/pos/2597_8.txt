Ulysses as a movie should in no way be compared to the novel, so they are of different entities different. However, being said, the film still manages to hold many of the elements that have made the book work, but since it is a visual means, it is more difficult to pull-in-awareness. I think this is the best film they could do with the material ... and this is from someone who regularly yummy on film was not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is always fun.
