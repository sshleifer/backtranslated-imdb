This movie surprised me! Never heard of Hyde in Gackt I did not wait a lot! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in John Woo style! Normally I'm very careful then this is to claim! There is only one John Woo and til this day there was not one director who came close to shine when he came to action! The fact that "Moon Children" would present a vampire conviction I even more! How can you go wrong with gun flying winds! Sounds promising and exciting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was the march was considerably slow! It takes it by setting the mood! This movie has some beautiful Hong Kong action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not a movie action! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and the relationships of each other! Peter Hyde and Gackt makers do a great job of acting and are very credible as friends! The only problem I had with the plot! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they were jumping! Example: When a member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) without drinking at one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation the movie scrambles 9 nine years and most of their friends are not together again! Also without a proper reason given to Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know that this is to add some serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it feels forced! Apart from the flaws of this film scheme there is an ambiance and thickness that makes it difficult not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it just is! The overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere!
