"Telefilms" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a quick shooting schedule, which is why this movie still tends to make the buck tendency. George C. Scott defines Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, fully encompassing all his cold trends, and still makes him a sympathetic character. Production value for this movie was exceptional, never relying on buffers of special effects or weathering set-ups, but relying on the depth and clearness of over-site shooting and strong fortress. A movie that certainly stands alone.
