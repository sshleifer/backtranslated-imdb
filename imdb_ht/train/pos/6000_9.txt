Kristine Watts (Molie Week) is broken apart, missing her lover; he can not overcome his love for the lost in the past. He hired a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gave a list of his mistakes and things in rows. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. The first point that impresses in the "cure" is the stylish cinema that alternates black and white with color. The short and sharp scenario is able to develop a tragic and weak story in love with an unexpected draw point at the very end of less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is nice, but the volume is a little loud and is associated with the fact that English is not my native language, at some point I needed to repeat some words by the healer. The unknown actress lead has many performances and very gorgeous. I hope to have a chance to see it again on the screen. Last but not least, the first of the director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): N / A
