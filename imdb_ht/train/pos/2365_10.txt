Jeff Wincott is not just a hunk, he can kick butt! This film has some of the best martial arts movements I've seen in a very long time. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a ruthless politician, he did a great job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Martial Arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So it's not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares? It's just as good, if not better! (just check out her battle scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH!). My suggestion should be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you will really miss out on some great martial action.
