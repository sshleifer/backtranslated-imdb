I took this film by a friend and was uncertain about a Swedish film and subtitles. However, I enjoy every minute of this beautiful movie. The necessary colleges that people can have described confidently without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a couple of short seconds somewhere for the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility against brutality and hopes of tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly cool angle using a spectrum of character and natural flaws and characteristics. I particularly love how the film manages to address multiple aspects of human hypocritical behavior that concerns bias, discrimination and witness witnesses. An absolute gem in a movie that I will encourage everyone who will listen.
