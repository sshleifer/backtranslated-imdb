It's amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, # 1 fan of the Rock Punk Ramones band, at Rock 'n' Roll High School. Only so exuberant, you do not mind it's obviously too old to always be in high school (which reality is carrying out not every child to watch 24). The movie is a non-copied frolic-speed pause; Everything gets blown in smithereens in the end, and that's just how it should be. Mary Woronov, a prominent kinky and humorous guesthouse as the principal of the Nazi, has become a great, one-to-a-bit at the beginning where Frisbees jumps dangerously close to herself (how many have been used on that, or have read a flu?) and Dey Young are very appealing as Best Soles, Kate Rambeau. The link is weaker, ironically enough, in this chain-gang "High School" is the Ramones. They can not act, not funny, and the concert segments go on too long. A Ramones song, "I want you around," treated as a fantasy and is well captured; Other occasional songs are good, particularly a palace Paul McCartney has heard close to the start ("Have you met somewhere before?"). Great fun! *** from ****
