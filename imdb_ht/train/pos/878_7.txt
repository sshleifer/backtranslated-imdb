Interesting characters, many of tensions. As close to black and white without black and white. I was turned off by how silently careless sympathetic character, a quiet, near secret deafness, could go through crimes of ruin colleagues, roughing up people in her way and finally participating in an heist, and setting up someone to be knock off as a clean go go away. I'm a little put in the trend for movies otherwise to show criminals in a sympathetic manner without addressing the crash they have done other than their show their immediate opponents as jerks. In this movie we never know who's the money it really is to abskond with, or what's happening to the innocent wife that the senate secretary used to set up at the sable bar owner to take the fall for the missing thief. Too bad, the movie could be great.
