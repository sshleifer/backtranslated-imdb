Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile living actor. English professional aristocrat in a room with a view, passionate Irish stealing In the name of the Father, a violent, violent gang of the New York Gang (in a ten-ten-ten-tener performance than the pianist) and as the crisis outrageous brown and cerebral palsy at my left foot (just to name a few). His role all influences each other, but each separates, and uniquely unique. It changed completely, with each character taken over. And I start believing that he can act as nothing. Anything. <br /> As Cristy Brown is it stunning. It's not ridiculous the character, and it does not spare the character. A difficult success. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. <br /> This movie, although small-transition fault with the love, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But it's stupid sentimental? My name is laughing. I was crying. Not a moment in cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. My favorite scene is the scene of the restaurant, when Cristy discusses painter and Eileen, Peter and his friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis arrives at a climax. "I'll kick you into the only part of your animated animation." "Riding outside the snake!" And its performance never slow, never falters, and it's nice. Simply. It has a lot of time screens here. I looked at her again, and I never get tired of Christy's perspective, twitching and speeches well. <br /> <br /> A must-see. Fo sho, Yo!
