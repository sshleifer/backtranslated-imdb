This was a top-notch film and a top-notch cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed are thoroughly cast in this good movie about real angels that help the Angels baseball team. You never know, it might happen. I liked Lloyd's role in her. It was hilarious. The story is about turning your life around, as the kid's belief in Angels helped turn around angry, stubborn, and refreshing manager Glover to see the best of people. The film was well done and also saw the best of people and came to your dreams. It was funny, good, touching, and sad, all very nicely done. You will love (or love) it. I'm guaranteed. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
