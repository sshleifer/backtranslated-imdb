In my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could be best if it was short 10 years earlier. I doubt he would benefit from modern technology but would look better if he was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and anime performed a great job. In my opinion, this film can boast the best background art and one of the best character designs. Animation is very smooth and realistic. For the duration of the film you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. It can also boast one of the sexiest girls animated characters, if not the sexiest, that beet girl animates typical with ease. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the time. First, the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and is really old-fashioned by modern standards. Second, due to the long duration it would benefit greatly from extra 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the environment is not so popular at the time. <br /> Conclusion: A great alternative to another short story about the Conan Barber, but not in a novel.
