Carmen is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's hard to say that the best performances are: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb.They dancing their soul out. It's a beautiful story of inseparable life and myths; History penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is dancing. Real people in one and the same time live their own lives and become another person, acting out the parts of lovers of old. The magic continues.
