All the dogs going to heaven are one of the best movies I've ever seen. First I saw it when I was like 3. Now I'm 12 and I rent it, it makes me think of things and brings back so many memory, that was the "days". I love the music, I love when Charlie is reaching the sky, I love the song "let me be surprised". I like Charlie's similarity to his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play this great Charlie's voice. I love this movie, the first one is the best one because it's so original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could be back in those days. I love the characters. If this is how memories are back when I 12 imagine how I will feel when I am like 19, I hope I'll be able to watch this when I'm older. When I first saw what I never knew I would really look at it and feel that way, I hope it will be available to watch. I'm so happy that this movie was done with the amazing idea came in mind and heart. In a scale from 1-10 I would give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It's so hard to explain the feeling, when I get older and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
