I'm a rather pedestrian, and a bit lowbrow taste. However, I occasionally try to raise the coffee on my cultural knowledge. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe of all the movie. I loved it so much that I got my tapes to see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotional hit film. I've seen it as a big question to the viewer: What is the depth of a accepted acceptance service, can they ask to accept, should they accept? As a military member, this is of course an important issue to me. This issue suggests heavily on this movie viewer. <br /> <br /> Recommend.
