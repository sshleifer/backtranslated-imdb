I am the "Christopher Reeve Generation" it is just to say that he was the best actor to play Superman again, but that did not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves made a pretty offer Good hit Chris on the head, though it just barely falls short. That does not stop me from enjoying this movie, she has a lot to go for it. He has everything a movie needs, a scheme with beginning, middle, and end, plus all those parties are intelligently writing. The film is both the act of acting and scenario, something a movie-noir, but with low. The story is both interesting and meaningful, this is a movie and a message that is not too preachy. I'm still amazed this shot on 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we did not have to wait 5 years just to see if the film would fall into hell development ... The polished film and expertise made, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency. It never allowed the constraints of technology to slow down it, in fact there are some creative things done to create the effect of theft, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck with high tire and traveling fast to make it look like ours See it from the superstitious point of view, also a few supplements of George's work process, with a long shot of an animated devotee. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the series George Reeves TV. A DVD is owned by its own right, the inclusion of the movie as its original is ice cream on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood today blessed God!
