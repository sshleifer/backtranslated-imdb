Like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, other great, comedic comedy, jealousy has great performances by two actors playing essentially, losers (can be too harsh to a word, I'll call them suburbs under-Achievers). This movie was a black comedy gem, and I'm not sure what people expect. I'm just seeing a great studio comedy not filled with obvious humor, and I believe that the tiny moments of this movie make it refreshing. Look at Stiller's face when he sees the dog dog disappeared for the first time to capture a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of jealousy in a really interesting way. There was a lot of big scenes (cop of the "cabin by the lake", Corky immorality burial, Weitz's wife, and J-Man Walken's - everything is great. <br /> I can not stand people Find out about IMDb and their impenetrable movie films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to do one I'll take envy on almost any of the ten ten grossing themselves in the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It's Wittier, Wackier, with an offbeat, enjoyable gem. <br /> <br /> Remember this people; Most times, Popular does not equal Good.
