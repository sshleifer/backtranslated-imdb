There are many worth of this movie that it is hard to know where to start and praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. What performance stands out from the excellent cast is praise. Robert Mulligan was rarely ashamed of us who admired his work. Each frame of the Man of the Moon is the film's evidence of its best.
