What can you say when you see a good French movie that tries to draw a suspense story in line with the social background of the characters? The important point is that we believe in these characters and once they met with each other we want them to stay together. It's simple and really effective. The background history is less important. Why is the movie going on the side of a half-thrilled comedy? It helps not get stuck in these social protests most French movie-jerkers love to do. Not too much ambition, right: Over lew is just a fun French movie and good characterization. <br /> For all the smart noir points in the sequel to the sequel is by far too easy. It goes as easily as in the rear window (an obvious reference and definitely not a movie noir) but with a less compelling context. Where I am amazed it is to see that the probe's character has not been deleted. It brings a lot of stories; when it appears on our own we ask if we do not miss a previous one. Jacques Audiard is not a new-comer yet. Strange and unusual.
