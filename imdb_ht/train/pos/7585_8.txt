This is a weird, cerebral, surreal, esoteric movie. If there is such a thing as "cynical horror" movie, this film is it. I began to find fear and wish there was another person watching her with me, and she barely had a draw! I'll have to see this movie again several times before I feel really understanding it. If you are the kind of person who likes "my dinner with Andre" and films by Godard, or if you do a lot of drug-altering drugs, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
