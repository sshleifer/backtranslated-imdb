This is one of the most favorite movie ever. Parker Posey's character is over-self-fun, and the librarian's motive will not be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and deck worlds. <br /> <br /> If you are a student library, this RENT. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is also highly recognizable. I have shown this movie to more libraries than any other - they all fall in love with it.
