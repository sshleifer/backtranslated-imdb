I watched the trailer on the DVD after seeing the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie should be very surprised and possibly disappointed. He did much to the fact that the film was "not the director of cube" and made it look like a horror movie, when in fact it is a absurdist comedy (IMDB spell checker does not seem to think that absurdist is a word, but it is), reminiscent of Rosencrantz and the Guildernstern dead. <br /> I love the way the story builds up slowly at first, then gradually scrubs. I also love the fact that there is no explanation for what's happening in the movie. That with the fact that the story plays out mostly in just putting in one they are the only ones in which this film is similar to cubes. I recommend it.
