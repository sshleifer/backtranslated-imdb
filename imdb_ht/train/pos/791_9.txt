No knowledge of this film before seeing it on Rialto Channel I found it to be a beautiful, impressive movie and enriching movie. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were slightly exaggerated in places, (but this is a movie). The way he looked and enjoyable giddy ride the main character took until he returned seriously, as real life can and do. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was especially interested to watch this movie once it started because people often joke about its ability to act (I get this very too because it's still a solid actress in my opinion). <br /> I liked the bit at the end of which Andy's character said "sometimes I feel it's never here" etc., it was so completely how it really is in such a situation (which I can personally identified with), then there was that classic gorgeous piece "Nocturne" I think by Chopin, which was a great way to end (bar comedy of light at the end, which was probably necessary). <br /> I say "well done" to the movie makers - I saw 1000s of worst movies!
