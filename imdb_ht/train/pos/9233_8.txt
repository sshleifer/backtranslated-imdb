Flavia (Florinda Bolkan's "Do not Torture a Cemetery" fame) close to a convent of carnal descent by her father .Shoot all of the sadis she sees around her (rape of a young woman in a pigment, sexual desire, cast castles) Flavia decided to run from the convent with her Jewish friends from the outside, Abraham.The did not get too far before they were captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced repentance. After his punishment met with a Muslim band called Tarantulas, who had invaded the previous convention and led a crusade that came in nothing short of a bloody battle behind the walls. The "Flavia Heretic" is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of Italian nationalization .The film is a bit horrible and sleazy at times. The action is great and the characters are well developed. In general, the "Flavia Heretic "It's a really moving and smart movie that has lots of stripping and gore. You can not go wrong with it.8 out of 10.
