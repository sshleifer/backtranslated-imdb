Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a documentary that does not preach on globalization until I saw MARDI GRASS: Made in China. This movie has zero narration and combines truths with sensitive interviews with four young workers in China who live inside a factory compound. To play with games, jump rope, and dance. But most of the day and night consist of work, work, and work - but the foot of work is luminous and fascinating to look. The owner of the factory in China is amazingly open, so much so that it hit home-made globalization while it "punished" the workers. As well as the sheet of Mardi Gras pearl from China at the Carnival, the film reveals how the site is connected to the global humorous and interesting world, footnote from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the introduction of cultural cross-cutting of factory workers and Mardi Grove revelers in each of the pictures. Here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The movie is never preachy, it's not guilty of driving, and allows everyone to be present. In the end, we - the viewers - make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film, and globalization.
