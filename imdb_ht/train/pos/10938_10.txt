According to I've ever encountered a movie so full that I must talk about it immediately. This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it's very authentic. I've seen the armed version but I'm on my way now grabbing the DVD and Chinese original dialogue. Still, the dubbing did not get by the way and sometimes give some bad humorous humor: "Poisonous clay rock the world !!!" The storytelling remains true Chinese method of intrigue, suspicion, and inter-personal relationships. You can expect twist and turn as the identities of the 5 venom reveal with an expert speed. The art of martial arts choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. It's like looking real creatures fighting each other, but interpreting from their own formal martial arts form. This level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema. The combination provides for a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it only on the basis of genuine genuine intention to say a martial art history and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people pummel with each other, along with whole forms of ancient Chinese turtles, let me invite you!
