I know, I know, it's kids. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that has suffered a lot of "bad" and still does not lose its faith in humanity and its sense of humor. What's special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and is not used as an increase in some hotshot actors. In addition I love the scenario: Paulie says his lifestory to a cleaner at point he hit rock bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci's!). And Navy Cheech of course, the man is my humor. Ever since I saw "awakened in smoke" I appreciated her naive way of doing, making a simple situation a hilarious one .. can not help myself.
