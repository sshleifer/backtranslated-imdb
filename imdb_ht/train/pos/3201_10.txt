This is an early film "Pilot" for Hit the Canadian TV show boy park. He plays executives in a few networks before Showcase decided to sign up for a TV set. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best movie comedy films. The film scheme is that these two small criminals time to go around "exterminating" pets people for money. If you have a dog next door that barking all night these are the guys you go by! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> Rated R for swearing, violence, and drugs. <br /> It's not too offensive either (they do not actually show off the animals)
