Sure Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) beat all the others in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> It has horror (non-graphic), romance, robot, witty good, intelligence, (exquisite good) special effects, and drama. <br /> I saw this movie a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly hit printed, and I was amazed at how well she got up today. I thought the electronics old style would look hokey, but they somehow look futuristic and modern. Ann Francis in here (mostly) short skirts and make foot with an innocent femdom that hard to beat always gets an increase from me. <br /> <br /> The crimson monster appears in the ray beams always having their bejebees crisis out of me. <br /> In our course we all know that the "Great Bird of Galaxy" probably molds much of "Star Trek" in this movie. <br /> No one has yet to beat Robby, the robot, in terms of personality <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). This film, in general, is the standard that all the other Fiction Science films will have up to now! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention of the haunting electronic note that keeps us all on pins and needles.
