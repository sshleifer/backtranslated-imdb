As a guy in the surreal (of art and film) I was happy to discover this movie about IFC. It is definitely a shepherd. Most of the other reviews say the overall scheme (not all incorrect) so I will not bother to make someone with that. The main thing is the alternating world concept that brought Ana's disease next, and how he managed to connect with another person after being "alone," and finally with his family, which I believe is still at least a small troubled. It only can be called a horror movie in which it has scary scenes but it's a fantasy (with a little hint of "coming to age" only because Ana is a pre-teen who "hates boy"). I recommend recognition to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination.
