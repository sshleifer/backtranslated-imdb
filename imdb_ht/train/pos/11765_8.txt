This film was amazed me, it was a good one-liner covered with laughter, an action storyline that did not load stock with tons of gun action and explosions. This surprise film has a lot of good twists and turns. The plot is solid despite what others may think, it has kept my interest ever right up until the very end. In conclusion; This is a great way for a movie action movie to spend time on.
