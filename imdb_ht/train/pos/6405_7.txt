I thought the racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear was enormously overdramatized for the Hollywood effect. I do not think that the US Navy was ever unbalanced. I can not imagine a full captain, Commander Officer, ever telling His Chief to intentionally wander anyone. Certainly not at risk for his life. And never been a Petty Chief Officer as unabashedly prejudiced against all, but WASPs as DeNiro characters. No Chief as dirty and drunken as he played would ever risen from Master Chief in the first place. Cuba packaging saves a sinus sinus sinema.
