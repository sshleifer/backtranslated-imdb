I really enjoyed this first by Ring Manager, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring in advance then you will be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this movie flick. It has a subtle spuite on it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest the most mainstream cinema of this genre. If you like films that give you the thrill, then you'll probably love this one. A good, first climb by Hideo Nakata. 8/10
