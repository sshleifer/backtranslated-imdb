Level One, Horror. <br /> When I saw this film for the first time at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. He did. Amazing, as I remember, it sounds as much as the eye of the monster has caused them. <br /> <br /> Level Two, Psychoanalysis Theory. <br /> Since an adult, I see the story for what it was: What if the savage, our sculptor, we all manifested. <br /> <br /> Level Three, Most Fiction Science. <br /> <br /> Levels better to plausibly realize the plot "What if" is in the genre of science fiction. This is the best science fiction, not the "Cowboys in Space" that is happening today. <br /> After 43 years, banned planet remains the greatest of all fiction science films. If planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, look out!
