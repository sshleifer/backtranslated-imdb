This film is directed by the Renny Harlin Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse on mountains and ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct actionmovie. Stallone needs this role to return on the path. Snow Mount is a great place for action films and is best for directing movies in snow, ice, cold and bad weather than Finnish people. Action is good! Music in the movie is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghow, the other star Micheal Rooker (portrait of serialkiller), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). They are placed in beautiful places and it is very interesting movie. In general, good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember extreme discharge: special collector edition, with extra good.
