The master of film Cecil B. De Mille goes West. Using three Western legendary legend as its protagonist (they probably never met), Gary Cooper describes Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur make a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story serves only for De Mille to hang some sequel to wonderful acts, such as the great American attack. Sinners like these are very well done. If you do not mind their performance a bit over-the-top at the disposal of this is a very entertaining Took out for a young Anthony Quinn dodging the role of a brave Indian who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. This got him at least noticed in Hollywood.
