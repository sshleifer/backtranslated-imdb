This film has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - thin correction, little no continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (you might even say non-existent) acting, line story lines, shots going to FAR too long ... and it's perfect for removing MST3K-style, not to mention the "Cuddle Eating toys": Scribble in Shape ... Take a Shot - Sign Your Name ... Take A Shot - Catch A Bad Foley Modified ... very, many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not rate it above 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and because despite its bad crazy, it's only an hour long - hell, a movie like this should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
