Full House is a great family show. However, after watching some episodes over and over again, I realized that they are incredibly boring and they seem to shave themselves out of the world out there. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate it, but just do not watch them over and over again because they get old quick. Probably the best season is the first. <br /> Full House is on veteran Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies she is in need of some help. So, her best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the girls' Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) moved in with them. Once they stay there together they find that they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you just how important your family is and that you can always go home again.
