This film captures the sense of absence of an American patriot actor - someone who believes his work (and politics) as criticism of the American people as the opinions of the President himself. Alan Bates captures this attitude perfectly as Michael Baytes, and I'll immortally remember Bates like this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike. It is an important piece of movies, which is able to capture its audience through the magic of making a movie and revealing just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose the full control of the desired actors and plurality of outdoor workouts. Belgian, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the topic that shows: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control, and commands both the 'rear-scene' portion of the movie, and the movie-in-film, "Flight of Bogota" with clear and insight. If you are at all interested in the understanding and strength of Canadian movies, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
