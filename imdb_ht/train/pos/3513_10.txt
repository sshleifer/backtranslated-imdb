Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a football in a football entrepreneur who buys the passage of two African players and tries to sell them for a lot of money at the rival club in the Benfica (club at its heart), FC Porto, that these players did not play well, and wanted the Port FC was wrong with this. But what's happening is that the two players are all good and FC Porto sells for a lot of money in a foreign club, doing a good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great antecedents of great films, is a very good and humorous comedy that shows all the rivalry between North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Very recommended
