Both the UK's critical criticisms have claimed that the ruler understands some fanboys insisting, revolving at least in many an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his caps. But then, nothing is more despicable than an ambitious movie that bites more than it can grind, especially one using the gangster / con artists artist foundation. As expected in Luc Besson's name on the credit as producers, there is a definite element of 'Cinema de Gade' on it: putting in a realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, there is a couple of superbly edited and consequence of action sequences and style oozes, all in marked as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a quick buck, and he spent a lot of time thinking about reading, life, the universe and everything. If nothing matters to him is that he tries to throw too much influence (slightly in Machiavelli, an outlet of Godard, a lot of the Fonts Principles), motifs and techniques, littering the screen and quotes: the movie was Originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams on photographs of the victim's dead bodies, and at times it feels as though he never read a fortune cookie and did not want to turn into a movie.

Not worth to start a new religion, but I wonder he did not get a US distributor. Perhaps they found intentionally false Ray Ray's just too damn awesome?
