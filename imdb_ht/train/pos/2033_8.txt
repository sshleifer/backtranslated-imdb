Actually, the answer only carries a small part of this Imax excellent film that educates us on our delicate top. C.G. with special camera - assisted by Imax - incredibly displaying inside (and external) functioning of an average person, be it old men and women, boys and girls, or babies. Almost every body part is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (featuring a hit Marvin Gaye), the heart, etc. There are some moments specifically revealing how a baby can be bathed under water and also how to influence the brain. It is amazing how we operate. Topics are topics around a lot of terrible. But at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should * ask * to know.
