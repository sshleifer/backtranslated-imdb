Bar some of the acting doubts (there are musicians at the end of the day), in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is "the best stone film ever to do ... period" <br /> <br /> 8 thousand, but without the reminder - a young musician, trying to prove himself in the local community, also fighting to deal with a broken home with a band of rivals. Throw off sex interest and truly outstanding performance, this real 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince gives a solid performance, such as making Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Descent script, good direction, great draws, and spectacular performances. Remember some of the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
