The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you do not need to see the original. Unfortunately this is also the biggest disadvantage. It would be good to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and see how life has been developed. Sinclair as the original is excellent and gives the movies the best moments as it tries to deal with awkward situations and embarrassing but throwing in support is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character over and create an original end but the movie is finally flawed and miss the heat of the original
