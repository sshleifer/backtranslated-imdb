The first time I saw it in the movie theater when it came out, and the crowds were really in the movie that had experienced all the fun more. This is a great cast of characters, many great names in it, a few of them who did not like to recognize then as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or you liked them in other movies, to add it to your watch list. Some of the scenes actually remind me of the kind of comedy that is well-done in the Birdcage or even the Clue, odd spontaneity-appearing comedy, and some really professional deliveries to those beloved actors. The film did a great job in giving us some insight, perhaps even very realistic, in the culture of a daylight soap.
