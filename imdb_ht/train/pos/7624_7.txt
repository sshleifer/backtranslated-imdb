A very memorable movie of the animals-kill-man varieties, especially as "Willard" in which he star an actor character (in this case, a step down somewhat at the level of Les Tremayne, who put in the only distinguished performance I saw him giving) to a role as a man of life is unbalanced and who immediately decided to use his creature to quench their exactness on those who were wrong. Yes, this is one of those movies where everyone is lovely, so that you will cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, places, etc. could not be the best to give film to an atmosphere of shabby decadence . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! When the local predator clamp down on his practice to collect small animals from local school children as bait for his snake, and his friends marry a strip (so trash night merchandise night concert concert) it goes on the rampage The process creates a memorable pil-up of clunkers under the cliff where he threw the debris after the cast of their unfortunate masters. An entertainment game you can play while watching "Snake" is to put bets on the cars going down the cliff. <br /> At all, very cheap and exploiting, but they will really have a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.
