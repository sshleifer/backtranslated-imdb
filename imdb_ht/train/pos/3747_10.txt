I have never seen many movies online in most of my life, but if I choose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, A smart reference to most films like star troops (etc.), using a camera, and Sisi of Steel, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a board, and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame frames to get a world inhabited by spatula. The story begins in the middle, the elbow that the director has fun? Then the middle is at the start, and so when I first look at it, I expect a pixel look mogue, but Jason, Like me, likes to look like, so take every detail of the max. although I do not recommend it to the kids, or would anyone like me love it, but please search it up on the net (read a short movie, watch up movie cow), style it reminds me of South Park, but less violent . 10 for the look, 6 for the laughs, and 6 for the story, it all comes in a 10/10, good job <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm worried to see the movie.
