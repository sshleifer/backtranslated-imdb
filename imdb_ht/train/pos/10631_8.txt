This movie was seen by my wife and me when she came from 1978. It was a revelation to us. We actually thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple ever married and were kids. Obviously we were wrong. Love power from where you do not expect it and maybe not want it. But we both chose that love anyway. <br /> And no, she never changed our sexual orientation. This kind of thing is for the Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young we both had artifacts, but never with the opposite sex. As we age we stopped having extramarital affairs. <br /> This story is not far off. However, the suggestion that they became heterosexual looks very unrealistic for me. My wife and I were sleeping together for the last 40 years. We are always gay. End of history.
