An excellent example of "Cowboy noir", as he called, in which Michael Jobs (Nicolas Cage) lost out of a job because he insisted on being honest (he had a bom leg). With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he will lie. When she walked into a bar, and the Wayne landowner (late, great JT Walsh) mistaken her for a hit that Wayne hired to do in her sexy Suzanne wife (Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form), Michael play along with Waynes' money acceptance. Then she goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husband's intentions, and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that did not complicate enough things, the real hit man, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) showed up and Michael is in even more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Director John Dahl, who co-writing the script with his brother Rick, was smart at realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated little town that can see the best of days and of what residents can participate in any way quick. It is also a fun idea of ​​what kind of problem an honest person could get in if they decided to abandon the principles and give in to any level of temptation. It's a story and a variety of main characters that if they are not corrupt, they are at least morally compromised like Michael. The lighting by Cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is superb in his humanity; Even the highest point placed in a graveyard gives a wonderful morbid quality of everything. Though the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the movie has a great way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in the lead but its co-stars have a great old age sinking the teeth of violent and greed-motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle, and Walsh are all fun to look at these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are good Walshs deputies (in one specifically fine, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there is a fun comedy role for the country & west star Dwight Yoakam, who also grabs the movie with an end to credit enjoyable melody. <br /> It's quite a good little movie worth checking out. It moves forward at an impressive speed, and if nothing else is certainly never boring. <br /> 8/10
