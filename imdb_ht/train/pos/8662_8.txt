I liked this very much. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan) I just might like it. I'll echo other reviews in saying that this film really grows about you as you look. It starts kind slowly but the way to infolds is very natural and has an attitude in it. You just get into it. I really liked the summer atmosphere of the movie and thought the film was very touched as a whole. Characters have a solid component of realism and the movie very slowly and gently leaves a spell as you participate in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will finally turn out and what way the characters will choose to take. I'm very surprised that there is less then a dozen comments on this-have dark TV movies that are more commentary then rich in love. <br /> One thing that I'm going to say is the missing end that drives me crazy and I have to watch it again to see it. This is a movie that can not be for everyone, but that I feel strongly overlooked (even some of my most puristic movie my purist films that have seen almost every movie has no view) and does not even seem to have Many of a message message but I liked it so much and everyone who loves hot family plays about scenery, atmosphere and a depressing speed depression should probably take a look at this. Especially worthy note is that it takes place in South Carolina so for people (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place, this is a gem. I will add my vote in the beginning comments and recommend this little known flick.
