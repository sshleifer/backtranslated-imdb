What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie that I've seen the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. He was born in 1953 and probably double bill but he kept me on the edge of my seat. Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) drives an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. Mary has an autumn out of the jetty and the only way she is to be saved is if barbara drives back into a garage for some rope. While there is running a psychotic assassin (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorite) and following is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker back with her to free her husband l '. The movie was so suspicious and a surprise - I was not expected as a big movie. But I suppose I should be able to achieve - Is Barbara Stanwyck nothing to do that is anything less than wonderful?
