This is really the oldest movie in all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narration, but also among the first cinema to present the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedy. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are two of the most clever and witty creators in Sweden today, and this film really puts on the display. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna Male" (Adult People) is a hot-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood, and the question is if we would not be better without it.
