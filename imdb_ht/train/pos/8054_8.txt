"Entering the Fat Dragon" is one of my funniest martial arts movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung introduced a Chinese farm boy who came to visit a friend of the city. Just like Tang Lung's "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, starting issues, that's why he has been relying on his martial arts skills to solve their differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking her idol, Bruce Lee. She even threw her nose and thumbs exactly the way Bruce Lee makes and frees her jump. It also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There is a great confrontation near the end of the movie including foreign fighters. Samo has to meet every opponent one by one. The sort of like "The Game of Death", where every fighter owns a different martial arts discipline from another. <br /> This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching, and also very first Sammo Hung cinema I've seen. Exciting battle scene with a lot of laughter. A rare classic Sammo Hung movie I highly recommend to all your martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
