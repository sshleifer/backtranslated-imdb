If you love animal cinema, this movie will please you. My wife loves animals and cinema animals, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It is suited towards children, but I laugh at most of the humor. The French fashion movie has made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its elope, happily, apeal family, but I love leaving the theater with a positive proposition.
