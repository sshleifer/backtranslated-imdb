In my opinion, this movie has not received the gratitude it deserves. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I love so much from her work, and that was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read books this year before she came out on the big screen. He gave it to read after we saw the movie together. The movie and books hit an emotional place in my heart, and I cried a lot for several days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones in hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, but our love and family and history are enduring throughout the generations. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was awed by its beauty and how it brought in life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, "But when I am alone in the half light of the Canyon , all existence seems to fade into a being with my soul, and memories .. and the sounds of the Big Black River, with a rhythm counting card, and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, everything is going to be In one, and a river ran into it the river was cut off by the floods of the world and running on rock from the basement of time.On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops.Among the rocks are the words , and some of the words are literally .. I'm haunted by water. "The words, taken in the book and speaking at the end of the film (by Robert Redford, which is described as Norman Maclean), is basically writing, in my opinion . Any possible flaws the movie may have to cover by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography. It was nice!
