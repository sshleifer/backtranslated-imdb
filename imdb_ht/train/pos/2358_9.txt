Pushed Daisies is just a beautiful fairy tale, with shades of aesthetic "amelie" and romance. It has a beautiful palette, its shots well thought out and detailed, its name and capricious dialogue and too cutesy to be real, its great imagination, and its romance deep. <br /> Look at the blue of the sky's pop out of you, as blue can not get to the rest of the sets or shots (with some exceptions). <br /> Look at a weirdly natural song and totally satisfy from a scene. > <br /> Its points are gorgeous, its cast is very enjoyable, there's great music, and the two romantic romantic stars can not touch each other or it will die. How much blood pressure do you need? (Actually, I wanted to find a way around this one, but c'est the lifestyle). <br /> It's simply a show that it's a pleasure for an hour and, and I recommend it very. There were other TVs quite like it, and I would like to see more. She got me into a one-week crappy flu, as she did for good company. <br /> <br /> Bring It Back!
