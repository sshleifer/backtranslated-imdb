The season's final message was sent, I felt happy, and also felt to lie and deceive. Roseanne tells all her guys that the nine season was a lie because her husband, Dan, died. He admitted that the family had never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie just how he wanted or wanted it to be. I'm always confused about when Becky finished with David, with Darlene and Mark because Becky and Mark admitted they were pregnant. So I believe that's just how he wanted it to be, but he did not. So, the epic final was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
