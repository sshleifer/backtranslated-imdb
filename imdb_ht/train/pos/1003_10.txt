Another Aussie ruler, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it is very well. It does not resort to great special effects like too many Americans, it focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple scheme that Rebecca Gibney & Co brings in life. She followed the story of a couple who bought an old house that was supposedly home to an old woman who never went out, and whose husband disappeared from mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things start to arrive at home, and John Adam begins to turn into the missing man, who was actually a mass murderer. Very recommended. 8/10
