This is how to say an end to the animated batman and it's pretty much as good as it's going to and for every reason even having lots of action in it the storytelling of it is the good voice about the really good actors like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker, etc. The bandits are really good as the Joker, De-Face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman because it is really good. So be sure to watch it on TV or rent or buy the collector editions because it is really good. <br /> Overall score: ********* from ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
