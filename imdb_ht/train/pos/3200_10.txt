This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells of how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay - (Julian) and the top writer of the show and his ami Rickie and Bubbles play it on the top of what is a real real satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of says autonomous waste. The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian begin to make their world's most advanced search of crime. WHY and the reason behind everything should be a spoiler so I will not give real reason behind the more brilliant escape. Friends and times-times partners (Bubbles) are a brilliant character. The whole show is brilliant and missing the film will not affect the way you see the one-bit site com. It's a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire trailers park with little time crooks and little time but great time dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to look - buy - steal this program grab it. You will be glad you have done. And my American friend --- It will break you too. 10 out of 9. Brilliant. Television how TV should be.
