When I first heard that Hal Hartley had made an end to Henry Fool, I was excited (it was a personal favorite for years now), and then cautious when I heard he had something to do with terrorism. Having just seen it though, I was surprised to find that it worked, while still being an entirely different sort of movie than Henry Crazy. Writing with the directions were both dead and the act was superb ... Special kudos went to Hartley to normally reassemble the whole cast, right down to Henry's son, who was the only four of the original. As I said though, this film is quite different from the first, but it works: I reconciled myself to the change in tone and subject to the fact that the 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first movie ended. In that case, an unexpected adventure ... ... and that's all I'm going to give away ... not to mention the fact that I'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on with who's going to cross double who is. While it was certainly one of the best movies I've seen in some time, she suffered as many suits and her finishes, as it appears that Hartley is planning a third now and the film of your hanging hanging. I'll be sure to buy my ticket for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
