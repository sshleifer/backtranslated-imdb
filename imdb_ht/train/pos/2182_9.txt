This superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and singers at the top in the form of Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Mano are completely at home in the story which has apparently been supplied by Billy Wilder. One would like to know more about how much he has done with it, because it's an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile / fertile sterile story - almost a allegory in the entertainment industry, running by circle-up numskulls, but made to a world vibrant in art and played by a underclass exploded nobody and non-WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television, and film in the US, it's hard to see the hiding places in this film as prophetic.
