Crushing provides a combination of drama humor, humor and the ones that I find the English is established very well when it concerns the matter of the heart. Often known for directing John McKay write this wonderful scenario about three forty-friend friends in a small town in United Kingdom. All three professional women down-come from luck and men formed a ritual ceremony nights gathering with gin, striking and sweets of consumption including endless vacancies on the erroneous behavior or needs of the libidos. Andie MacDowell once again thrown by the surrounding of the British (which is where I find it to relieve the most) is absolutely charming as the mistress head of a prestigious school that gets involved with a smaller man. Small town gossip and friends who disagree with jealousy (great casting support) conflict with his relationship. Unfolding a series of unfortunate brutal events and showing us many difficulties when one is in pursuit of happiness. Keeping in mind the main focus of this movie is friends and ending to show us exactly that. This is the kind of movie you either love or hate, which is why I believe a lot of mix reviews and not the biggest success that resulted when this movie was released. As I'm sure the most are just overwrite the movie now. I greatly enjoy this movie and highly recommended for people in love of the films as "Actually Love", and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the band is extraordinarily perfect to capture these important moments.
