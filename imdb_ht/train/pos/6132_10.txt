I am glad that users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now forward. I do not understand who did not like this movie - it looks like they were expecting a serious treatment (?!?!?)! C'mon, how the hell can you take the home of a bloodthirsty sniper seriously? The film makers knew this was a funny quote, and they did not try to deny it. The straightforward delivery of the scene faces actually makes it fun! Yes, there are times when low budget shows (such as explosive scenes), but I think an expensive look might be taken away from the movie fun! So, if you like B movies, and predict their predicted jumps, then you'll certainly like "Jack Frost".
