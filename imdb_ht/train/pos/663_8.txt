I watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it is so enjoyable. And it is quite scary, but all in good, fun ghoulish. A woman killed her 2nd husband, but ran into a problem when a maniac escaped from a cut out Santa Claus outfit decided to pay it with her girl a visit at that very moment. Mary Traynor, whom I seem to remember from SNL or some TV commercials other comedy comedy, is the wrong wife, and Larry Drake plays crazy at the beautiful Santa's outfit. I've forgotten Santa played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an irresistible and scary force at times. You can probably guess how Santa finally got home. The episode is played for laughing, but it can also be very intense at times.
