Funny. Tris. Spacious. These are all words floating in my head while I watched this beautiful, simple movie. <br /> It is rare that a movie really moves me, but "Do we Dance?" accomplish that and thanks to reserve. Gentle humor mixed with occasional subtle agony made this easy one of the best experiences in my movie-watching history. She left me with a quiet sense of joy, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in. And the dance, oh yes, the dance. Even if you are not a lover of the art, or you can not put one foot ahead to another, these steps appear here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for as fast as you can. It was absolutely breathtaking, even the show that Sugiyama (touchingly described by Koji Yakusho) treated the stage when she first learned dancing was beautiful in a funny way, children. And yet, this movie was not entirely about dancing, but more about the intricacies of human behavior and feelings. We witness a shy man learn to express his thoughts in dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscover his love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the cast of wonderful support. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotions. All love and little agony in life here, expressing and the delicate feel of a painting paint aqua Japanese combines with the emotional strength and grace of the culture.
