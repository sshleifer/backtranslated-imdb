"The Thug in Baghdad" is impressive in the form of evil evil Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). It plots and lies with magic spells to find the kingdom of Ahmad's legitimate rule of law, and a gorgeous princess from his father ... <br /> It falls victim to the end, as all tyrants do ( in books and legends) in love and in the common man whom he ignores, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu). The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly achieved in both visual and literary terms. The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful ... the costumes of the magician and his guys rise and fall like winged birds, attack suddenly at night to wound their destruction and create fear ... <br /> The bright hero also puts white turban and clothes, and its princess is dressed in pink and pale blues. .. <br /> For spectacular scenes it matches all that has gone before, while through its use of color, it brings to life a world like not seemed likely before ... <br /> With Flying carpet and white flying horse, with a giant genius (excellent play by Rex Ingram), and evil assistant, and with the good act of Sabu and Veidt, "The Third of Baghdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Nights Arabi ... <br /> <version of 1940 remains the finest history of the screen!
