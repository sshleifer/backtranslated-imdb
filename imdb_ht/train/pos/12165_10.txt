Frownland is like one of those nasty intense situations where you end up laughing loudly at exactly the wrong time; and just at this time you realize you should not laugh, you've already reached the pinnacle of voice victory; and as you look around you in the fantasy white faces and open wide-open gaping eyes and glaze eyes, you feel a start peach to dip into the abyss of your abdomen and suddenly break up your throat and ... well, you get the point but for all its annoyances and punches in the face, Frownland, really is a remarkable piece of work that, after looking at the inarticulate chaos of a main character and all his pathetic illness, he is sick, Do you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time, you feel sikyfully sorry for him. <br /> <br /> It would be a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein's movie, but for some reason, I felt an unconditional determination to stay the course and experience all the irritation of movie films has to offer. If someone sets you in fire, you usually want to put it out: Stop! Drop! And roll! But with this movie, you want to watch the flame slowly swallowing your whole body. You endure the pain - perhaps out of spite, or some masochistic unknown curiosity I can not even begin to try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, mainstream movies will never leave this movie coming to a theater near you. But if you get a chance to catch it, prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag.
