I watched a few Cold Episodes over the years, starting with Episodes Season 1 back in 2003-2004. And while most were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but some rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may disagree with the story content (ie the male-to-male boyfriend's relationship), I doubt anyone can watch this without being deeply moved into their minds. <br /> The story is essentially a case that has been reopened, based on testimonials from a dead drug dealer. The central actors are two police officers in the 1960s called Sean Coop (aka, victims of cold cases that go to his name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is one, a Vietnam war veterinarian, and a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, married, and no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a romantic secret relationship that they both must hide in a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time. <br /> <br /> The flashback scene in life is mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then pouring at all. Examples include red squad machines, the yellow curtains gently blowing through the window in Jimmy's room, where Jimmy's wife looked at Coop and Jimmy drinking, fighting, and then kissing each other while being in a state of alcohol -pwovoke. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scene, and everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and reason. The tumor clearly homophobic between paternal partners and the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. A key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. At this stage, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a fellow-respected officer on the force, confused Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and shame of Coop's father were trained on Coop - "You will not be disappointed by our family ... and you are not my son, either." - clearly indicates the hostile views of same-sex relations in that era. <br /> <br /> Additional tensions can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go to it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin Homos". <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once he sees the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church, and his eternal devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop died, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but he could also die for his knowledge of drug and corruption funds that hit higher in the force. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene in the entire episode was when Coop, as he was sitting dead in bullet injuries in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words on his police radio "to her partner:" Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones .. do not forget. "<br /> The band selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with Chad Everett's actor, playing Jimmy who is still grieved, only older now, and clearly still misses his former partner, Coop. <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it best. It is without a doubt the best written, well-acting, and well-done in all Cold Case episodes I've ever seen.
