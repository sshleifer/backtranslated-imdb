I saw the Big Bad Swim in the movie 2006 Temecula movie, and they were totally kept in custody by how much I had drawn in it. The movie film around the lives of a group of people who take an adult swimming class for many reasons. A funny idea of ​​his own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater change in student life. <br /> <br /> What surprised me on the movie was how real she felt. Rarely in pieces of ensembles are character treated so well. I enjoyed the scene of the very class, and the drama that took place outside was very intense. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and finally it left a very strong feeling, much like going to school or summer camp - where you get friends quickly, forming good obligations and making discovery of yourself, again have to go all too early. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which makes you want to know a little more about it than was finally revealed. I suppose you do not get satisfied everyone in the classroom, though ... <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I've found the movie quite well rounded and quite enjoyable. See if you get the opportunity.
