And the number of actors working on the project has a great variety of cast. Nice CGI zetri in the green screen locations they need some work. Anyone who hears about Adobe After Effects 7, should buy it to find the best keys. The stories are well thought out, lots of trek elements in this keep it in the right context. But the idea of ​​kissing guy makes me wind ahead of the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I cant help that I do not get people kissing fun (dont mind women). Anyway ... For a fan of this is good. With minor improvements in the green screen, brushing up acting and some orientation orientation series is stunning. Anyway I recommend this series that has ever loved TNG and DS9.
