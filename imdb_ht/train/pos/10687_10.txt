I must confess that I was completely shocked by this movie. For one, I went to see her on a whim for a moment, but given that, the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist American cinema at all. This British comedy is at its finest - dark, original and funny in the way that American films just never are. I must stop short, however, to recommend this to all in all hearts; I went to see it with several people, some English, some European and some Americans and while some of us loved it (especially in the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you are in this kind of stuff then go. If not, do not. 10/10.
