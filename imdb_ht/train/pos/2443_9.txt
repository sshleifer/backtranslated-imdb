This film might not put the Catholic Church in the best light but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is all beautiful and rosy. Sometimes people and groups doing things at the moment seem like the right thing, but in retrospect does not look as great as they once did. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, yes it incorporates religion, but really the story is about a family, and the family's ability to stay together does not matter what is thrown at them. This film is also based on true events that does not mean that this story, scenes by scenes, are true, but if you have watched news articles in this time period you could see that no church occupies the incident in a ways that were helpful towards the family. Both the churches of the fault here, the Catholic Church forcing such a family regulation in the first place and not responding to the violence that came up with it and the Protestant church for telling the mother that it should be fair obey her husband and priest and do not put a fight. In this case both leave this family down. I believe that the film does a great job of showing this struggle in both the church and the family. It's no way to shape or form the Catholic Church, just the opposite, it shows how an incident can change the course of religion's ideas and how one can have a far-reaching effect then just themselves.
