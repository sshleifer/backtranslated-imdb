Well, of course, women are overly sensitive and in need of average, which is interesting to describe in whore mothers, but not pseudo-artistic, extravagantly, or blatantly lived on. Unlike many of you I only saw La Maman and La Putain twice. As many good movies, I noticed my opinion of improving after a second look. All I know is what I've seen and they do not dig in more exploits until I bought the DVD. I have yet to figure out exactly why I enjoy this movie very much, but really, what am I caring for? Even though I'm sure I could and will train some wonderful explanations. All right, so you can agree, maybe it's a bit boring at times, I'm not an expert. The Blon reminds me of a wonderful Grushenka.
