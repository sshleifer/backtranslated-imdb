I saw this movie and heard the writer-director, Juan Gerard, speaking at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and his family. His opening scene will bring to mind the "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is filmed with reference to classic film: Red Bull (Casablanca), Rebel Without A Cause, references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless person (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban tradition that often uses a black man as a type of Greek choir. What is this movie really is the accumulation of a dream. Gerard wants to honor his family and medium movie that he loves all his life. This is the true story of Juan Gerard and everyone in it is real, as is the show event. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate lover movie) but his dream has made this movie. He and his wife decided to live this dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel maintains the powerful screen as mysterious grandfather and cheeky "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans at the disposal. Urban Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y or Mama Tambien) offer solid support in key roles. Truthfully, the first half of the movie suffers from stiff delivery in line, with some extraction, but staying with it. The last half is the best events of the combined revolution for the Bernese, and the Greater Honor. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is honest as it is with his passion and heart really come in, in this sincere effort first. I would definitely see her again, and hope she continued her movie career. <br /> <br />
