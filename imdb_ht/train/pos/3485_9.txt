This Wrestlemania just did not do it for me. While some things, like the fighting king and the participation of celebrities, were a throwback in the good old days, so to speak, it seemed to be more of a highbrow in your home than anything else. Above average ... worth it for several matches such as the team match team match, although worth remembering is that the title change means nothing, as it has overtaken the next night.
