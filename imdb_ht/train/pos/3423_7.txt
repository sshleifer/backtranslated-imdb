Do not expect a reputation in the "truth". However, the accounts of the veterans in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan ask thoughtful consideration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> those who 'have suffered and still suffer from traumas at war. These are NOT fatal damages in the movie. <br /> As a veteran myself, I know that terrible after the war is real, and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets clearly describe the physical and mental pain and torture of most veteran experiences and ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
