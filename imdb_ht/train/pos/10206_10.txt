In my years of participating in film festivals, I've seen many small films like those that never get theatrical distribution, and end up in $ 3 bins at WalMart. I just found DVDs in the Tank Tank, Big Doc, but how sad it ends like a rock-bottom rock. <br /> I liked this movie, want I would see it in the movie in it all. I prefer that the New Yorker Films have translated the title directly. It is good for Americans to stretch a little. If the film title helps the US audience to explore random chaos, all the best. Cinema imitate life & visa versa. <br /> Also, I found it distracted by the subtitles putting prices in dollars. Come! The euro is not difficult to evaluate, making the gringo audience doing the math. Seeing a movie, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the effect to be spoiled by being reminded: I'm an American watching a movie and translating Euros into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer & director as well.
