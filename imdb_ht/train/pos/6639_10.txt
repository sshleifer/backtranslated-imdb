You've been using the IMDb. <br /> You've given some votes for some of your favorite movies. <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can it not give a ten? I am surprised at the person giving this a seven or eight ... exactly how could the first ever video be made? For the record, long, still open shot is great showmanship, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius has often been too much. <br /> <br /> This is engineering.
