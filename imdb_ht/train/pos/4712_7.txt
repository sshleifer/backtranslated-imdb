The obvious jokes, gags are coral, and the characters are walking character - but I could not stop from laughing at his very entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, I always get a kick from this one, and I recommend it to all lovers of mindless entertainment. He has many quotable moments, and some of the best-looking gags I've seen that day. If you had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one on your home on Friday either your weekend or a good start.
