James Dickey is a beautiful descriptive author. When a person reads "salvation", one is immediately transported to the lush forests in the South. When viewing Jan Boorman's movie version of the book, one realizes just how accurately captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. Characters are fully realized, and the portraits are fantastic. The first time I saw this film in 1992, after my college's ninth grade. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released in a couple of years at my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon", and "All Men's President"; fine films, all of them. This one was easy to class in the group. That's a lot.
