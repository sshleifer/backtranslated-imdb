This movie is awesome. sort of. It really talents say so much, or do many, but it's an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is. High school is taken over by ms.that wrong that hated one thing that all students love, rock & roll. Reef toning finds everyone's tickets to show them ramones, and the top of this film and a take on the school has directed my reef vow & ramones. This movie has everything, a bad script, direct doubt, bad actors (ie clint howard & ping sounds), an awesome soundtrack, extreme campyness, these elements & much more come together to do what it is, a classic. > <br /> note - while the ramones live wear, notice that Darby's injury in the germs is in front of the crowd. clean-o.
