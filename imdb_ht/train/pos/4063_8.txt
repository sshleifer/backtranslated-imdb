Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki movie. After seeing it for the first time, I am glad to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get worth your time, which means (like that Miyazaki's movie are anxiety), that's nothing less than excellent! <br /> <br /> Earlier productions in his cinemas career, the Sky Castle anticipated many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong characters (but young) girls, forced to grow due to external circumstances, helped out not very interesting (and sometimes lovable) characters supported. And, of course, the usual fight in nature against civilization, flying cars (lots of it !!), beautiful scenery scenery ?? But alas, no pig (at least that I noticed, after all I only saw it once). Never before, Miyazaki has already received his first theater of the earlier years, with Nausic√£a, a rehearsal dress for Princess Mononoke, his great opus. Castle in the sky set a bit of a part of these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his Conan television series, and its direct episodes in Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls out of the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a small town of mining town. Entrused by its amnesia and suspect a connection between her and the mysterious city flying to Laputa, Pazu is set to help her find out where she came from, also escaped the army with a gang of air pirates. As the film progresses, the draw becomes heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki in his best. <br /> <br /> The sound hole is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as the Sky Castle has first produced), and much like its director Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ begins with a very light note , which becomes more complex and very well fitting as the plot goes ahead! <br /> A note of English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although the Sheeta Anna Paquin has a very thick accent (which the actress has always been at that point in her career), with a head up for Mark Hamil as Muska, who makes up for a still demonic fun! <br /> <br /> Do not miss these people!
