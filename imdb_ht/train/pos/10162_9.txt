Ah, I loved this movie. I think it was all right. It made me laugh loudly over a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I write this from a girl's perspective. I think it's a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating. Too many people to vote? It was far above other romantic comedy. Just because I'm female I do not enjoy all chic cops, on the contrary I prefer other ways. Romantic comedies tend to be fundamentally and not as funny as they are meant to be. But, as I said, this movie has read all, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good one-material, fine acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character reminded many of Gabrielle from desperate Housewives, but so what? He was scared. I will keep this film for rainy days, days when I feel low and I need a few laughs.
