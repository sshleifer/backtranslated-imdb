Why does this have such a low rating? I really do not get it ... Is it because of the bad act? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these movies in low-budget movies? Seriously, acting with the dialogue is not important in these movies. People who hate cinemas only because of bad acting and bad dialogue should not allow low-cost movies to low-budget movies. Those films should not be taken seriously. Period .. Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I liked it! I bought it because I expect a gorefest, but not a gorefest and the gore is very bad (most of the time it's just intestinal creatures put on the body of the actors and this lame), but I did not really care because movie is hilarious! Characters are hilarious, the act is hilarious (bad act is something good in movie movies movie-low budget movies), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is good in low-budget movies movie movies), the violent zombie And a big dick is hilarious, the flying demon baby is hilarious and I could go over and over and I, but I do not mean too much ... but I have to mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like she's lol lively! Oh and the rapper zombie falls in love with lol in sex dolls! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! What the Hell Did You Snort? What hell is that? Detective Manners: It's Nothing, It's ... Ehh ... cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Injects heroin into her arms * Detective Sloane: What * Are you doing, Manners? Are you * crappy * crazy? Detective Maners: It's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What are you doing? Detective Maners: This maniac has rambling over the demons and then he began to break his head on the rock! She just started breaking her head on the rock! I think it's about PCP or something! <br /> LOL!
