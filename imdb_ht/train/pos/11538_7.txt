Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) was just thrown by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is her way out, but she just can not seem to get her to work, so she heads over to his friend's house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) also recently divorced and lived up to the single heaven. Smoking, gambling, striking on chic, eating out and never cleaning is her paradise. Well, with attempts to suicide Oscar decided to let Felix move in. First, it's a match made in the sky, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay her food on time, but quickly Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix (which in today's world would probably have gay) is not ready to move on. They invited a couple of British birds over and found Felix so sensitive that soon they and Felix wept and discussed his family life, leaving Oscar refused. This is it, he explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as discouraging as it looks, and soon he has the upper hand. Listen to my favorite "You let me score a little on my pillow. Tell you 158 times I can not stand little on my pillow." We all come from grainfields. F.U "Took me three hours to evaluate F.U was Felix Ungar!" Based on a Neil Simon play (which also writes the scenario), this has a certain theater to feel it. Insert and repair the look and feel feel like play-like (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedy movies and have appeared in Grumpier Old Men's movies and out of the sea, repeating the same bright / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid rye issues, I'm sure). <br /> <This movie is like strawberry dipped in chocolate. Chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you find those nasty green ones). They are opposed to almost polar, but simultaneously, their contrasts emphasize each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
