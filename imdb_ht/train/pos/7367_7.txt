I'm currently studying film at level A and "this is not a love song" is a movie we have watched and in my opinion it is a movie that has a very simple storyline but a complex back story. If you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chasing film from people running to the country from farmers, after committing a murder: - "sound well out". <br /> However you need to dig deeper into discovering the true feel of the true genre. As it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of trust, deceit and betrayal. We have not said about that "love" directly in the movie but the events that come in out, for example the Heaton road to act towards Spike almost screams this intact love in our faces. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is a good example why British films are not to be postponed as "trash" just because they are doing a low budget. <br /> A good movie with a complicated story line, however it is definitely a gained taste and is perhaps not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
