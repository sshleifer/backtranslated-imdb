I've just seen this last night, broadcasting on 'Canadian Broadcasting' Canadian passion. She has been screening recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto Film Festival as well as many others. It is a remarkable movie. The creators literally stumbled into the story, having made a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves square among events as the unfolded coup. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happened. They, of course, have their own ideological perspectives (which are obvious), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a movie, it's not ground-breaking in a sense of stylist or aesthetic, and that's, I think, the way it should be. What we find to see what 'integrated' journalists should really be. What we find is a remarkable account of a country struggling to reach democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares about his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of enterprise / military / media interests combine to direct a coup to a democratically elected leader ... with unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds.
