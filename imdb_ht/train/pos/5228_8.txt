I found this hilarious movie. The flaws on other popular movies at that time were some of the funnels I saw in this sort of movie. Give it a try. If you saw the movie movie this is parody, and you get the humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (this is not a spoiler because I'm not telling you that actually happens) was a scene and "flashy thingy" at MIB. When they first discover the device and do not know what it does ... and later in the movie ... you'll understand when you get there. is that I could never get it to DVD so I could buy a copy.
