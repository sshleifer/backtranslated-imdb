HOLES is not what your average Disney is - it's very, very fun, even for growns that usually cringe at cutesy, focusing on the group's "family entertainment" studio that Uncle Walt's studio passes through as live-action. Maybe this successful film success is in its loyalty to the original book, which is a little darker than your average kid's kid. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats sent to a boy prison camp, where all the prisoners were forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of restoration. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story gets interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure gets ten times more fun than any Disney movie on an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially embarrassing and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
