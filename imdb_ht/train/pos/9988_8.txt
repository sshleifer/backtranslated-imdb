What I liked about the on-screen adaptation of the Stone Angel is that he lived true for the novel! Great movie! As a hungry reader, I find the worst thing about film adaptation is that the book somehow lost in translation. You can say that the Angel Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this movie. Ellen Burstyn was an excellent choice for the role of Hagar and is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chooses to play Hagar in her younger years also has done an incredible job that glorifies praise. I have not seen any of Horne's work before, but I'll definitely look it out after seeing his Stone Angel performance. <br /> I hear Canadian released in the Stone Angel theater that will happen in the spring or summer of 2008. I can not wait to see him on the big screen again!
