A sophisticated contemporary factory insists that their work is loosened and finally unbind the vows of marriage. The main occupation of the narrative comes from a 'homily' spoken by a priest who follows the wedding promised by a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future of the wedding is spelled out, which little by little frays from the insistence of modern life. 'Moral' in this story of a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it was necessary that these relationships be abutted by family and friends. This film was a blockbuster relative to Italian domestic standards. It's a terrible shame that this movie is not available in either DVD or VHS.
