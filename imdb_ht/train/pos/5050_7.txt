We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well said in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romanticized, with archetypes, humor, and a stress of dignity and value. <br /> <br /> So much injection and said of a beautiful appetizer is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who has become native American, and has gone to live with traps in Canada. <br /> <br /> Solid performance from all of this movie and an easy to watch message. <br /> Two of the stars in the movie are without a cutest doubt we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecoleanings. It must have been great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a paid pay tribute.
