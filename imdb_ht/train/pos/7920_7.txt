Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 You: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average guys or ordinary high school. Prepping for the big game Resident, problem girlfriend and growing hair in strange places ?? you know the usual. But the party parts strange hair becomes a bit wee out of control when a trip to Transylvania with her father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a cruel case in the furballs. Now end up in the world forever forever as a werewolf how will Adam find any girl? <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' does not often talk about but it's a funny and fun parody to support. Larry Cohen (Q's Sealer Wing, Stuff) incorporates as many gags as it may eventually come with as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good distribution of lead roles. If you happen to be a fan of parody like 'Aircraft' and 'Student Body' I think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest.
