I never saw a silent film until July 24, 2005. I never saw a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I saw thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic. I get the latest Mohikan and unforgettable (Ray Liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. I started watching Tess in the Storm on TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was, who was credited by much for launching Hollywood. I had no idea what I was in for. Two hours later, I broke out of it, and realized I would watch one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, playing a role perfectly suited to him. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, he never saw anyone gorgeous and so expressive before. You should see it again and again. The environment was perfect for an expressive girl. She was a poor skater, could not speak English King, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
