I had no idea about the reality of these films. As I remember this situation I accept the information presented then in the media: a confused happening around a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation in many realities, I wonder if something in this caliber has ever been done. I suppose the protagonist was Mr Chavez, but everyone came up with pictures <br /> <br /> was important and the end of the reality of entelechy: the people were overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
