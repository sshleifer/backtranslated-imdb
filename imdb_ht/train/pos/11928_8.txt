This movie, while seemingly based on a movie in the same title in 1951 released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover at one of his best performances brings George Knox, a down on his baseball manager with a brief temperament, to life. As for this movie being "stacked", how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his work experience works and the show of his performance on screen, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun) , Brenda Fricker (a good and well-seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes yes it is good at this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the Dazed show and confused, and his role may not be as essential in film this, but it was exposed) Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey goes even for Adrien, except the Dazed and confused party), some actors such as Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran at one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast made a great job, plus a great storyline that is pretty much irresistible to anyone, I do not care what meal of your depression is in. I liked this movie like a kid, and she brings back memories when I look at her today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to any parent looking for something children have not seen, and everyone else, for that matter.
