I like this movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never stopped. All the film was done very well. The finish is really good. The openness of it was full action, they even have a surprising set in there for you. When I saw that the movie was over the internet I was kind of sure if I wanted to see this movie, but my sense as a great Russian perry fan I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I gave it a chance because this was a very good movie though out. It was very original. Anyone who thought this film gets a standing ovation in my hand. The act was great. Luke Perry did a great job once again. I give this movie the highest rating.
