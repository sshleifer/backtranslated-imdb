Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think it's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" as curious as the other woman. Good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving Amanda's revenge on an abusive doctor who will stay with you for weeks. I'll leave it at that. Kudos.
