This movie is a pretty simplistic task. Jingle from beginning to end is both sad again uplifting at the same time. Their performance from Miranda Otto (oh, how she deserves more recognition ...) and George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to look, as the two tortured souls come to understand each other. Throwing the support of the workers at the Die Milk Offices is the wonderful little-party part of them, as Alice's long suffering companion, who I can not help, but feels a little sorry for. There's only one particular scene I could watch over and over (and I have!), It's as a shame that such movies do not get recognition, and therefore bring them to the public eye for more people to enjoy. I shouted loudly, I laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
