This movie is always my favorite !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm still on the moon, watching it !! This is a movie, that you really have seen, even if you are not a MJ Fan, to cause this movie to write, like Captain EO, E.T. with ghosts, a bit of film and music history !! This wonderful movie, from Michael's feather, is a must have !! And: Smooth criminals, is really wonderful, exciting and amazing songs I have ever heard of my life! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ's best musician hit this planet, she's a fine man and still brings bright eyes, when you listen to her music !! Please, if you do not know this movie, look at it and do not miss it, because it might be too bad for yourself if you miss it! -Highly recommended film, for every lover-
