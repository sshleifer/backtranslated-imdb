I really like this show. I can easily see how it achieves cult status. It's original, and thought to spark. For some reason though, I never felt the kind of resonance out of it that I could have. It does not park open doors, winter frosts that must be from such an awesome site. Whenever I watch an episode, I find myself prodding, and pushing for it to answer some nameless, formless questions. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me preface this does not say that what follows is my opinion, and my opinion only. Different currents for different types. <br /> I would like to see more of the "American Gothic" scene shot at night. There is too much of the day in this show, and I think he has a contrary tendency to the suspension. We are not afraid of the day, after all. We are concerned about what's in the shadows. The Devil is not always in detail. What we do not see is often the most scary. <br /> Second - and this one of this will probably lead to pitch, and feathers: Gary Cole is a very talented actor ... an actor character. I followed her career in Brady Bunch's film, which is why she paints me saying she was probably miscast as Lucas Buck. It is almost too petroichan, also likable to be the embodiment of evil, even by biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a narcotics. It's heroin. It is frozen in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of drainage-O. You keep going back, even if you know the end will be madness, and death. It should be like the final loan shark. It is a marker of books, but also of unspeakable conviction. Make sure. You've got the money, and before long you'll also have to have broken finger; a hand cut, a head decapitated, and eventually, a soul soul. Bucket Buck is a deportation act, and wherever it is, there should be some immediate, ambitious finality - with daily compounds - in the air. <br /> It's all largess, all strings attached, and when you realize that, you'll also know that it's too late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is in most of the scenes, in fact, that could have caused him to lose his edge. The sheriff should be like the mythology of next door. He is the closest friend. Many would know 'in' him, but only a few unfortunate would really know him. It should be the thing in flakback, and scripture script, and the perfect person to deliver this drawing draw would have the deputy character that Nick Searcy described. Four, the show might be very self-reverential - in a fault, some can say - and this is the tip of the whistle in "Meet me in the fishing hole" of the pilot series. I think we've already set up that Cassidy, and Raimi was shot to be anti-Andy Taylor. We probably did not need the concept to deliver us via Fed Ex. I think that in the first five minutes so, for me, the piano on the head was needed. <br /> <br /> These remarks are all about that, for me, they would do a great show. I also understood that the producers had their own, unique style, and that there was plenty of hand in the soup. In the ever-increasing demand for LCD programs, the network played a definite role in this period. <br /> <br /> The smaller these terk-off costumes could be when the episodes were in order. > <br /> Find real. <br /> <br /> Either way, it's a serious loss of both genre fans, and casual viewers alike.
