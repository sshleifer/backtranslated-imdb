I'm a fan of C & C, going back to the records, and liking this movie, but at a mid-1980 point on cable television in San Jose California, she was revealed with an alternate plot line that destroyed the point the whole of the movie. All references to marijuana have been replaced with "diamonds". The ring that "Red" drops in Chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ("... it's worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot in which the foreign clippet on a boat is added to observe C & C, and talk to each other about finding the diamonds. In the end, instead of "coke space", it's something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible, and obviously tried to make it family / child friendly. It would be best if the network was not disclosed at all.
