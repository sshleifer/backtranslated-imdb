'Before the devil knows you are dead' is one of the best movies I've ever seen in a long time. The action from <br /> <br /> cast into excellent ensembles is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman puts in an exceptional and electrical performance every time he is on screen. Etan Hawke matches his scene for stage and Albert Finney simply grinds up the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, <br /> <br /> criminal underused, but looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is excellent, story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, turned out to be a gem with this one!
