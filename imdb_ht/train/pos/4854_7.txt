Curl up with this one in a dark night and weather and prepare to be vividly amused, irritated and scared. The old plot drawn over on a Phantom train is said to run into the lonely country of the dead at night to be implausible, but it's a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old clich√©s like the "ACCIDENT" that locals can remember but they will not talk about. But mainly the film in a comedy machine for Arthur Askey shows his particular brand of humor style vaudeville in between the scary bits. The Queen's Queen is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash you it may be fun. This is probably the best of the movie here.
