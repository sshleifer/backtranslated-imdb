This film is about development. People who grow up with people who are fading, are surprised by people who are irritating. It has it all and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It is truly a classic drama with fantastic performances of the whole cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in his first role. This movie makes me feel very humane and proud of it, and I suggest that this film should be binding every Saturday throughout the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10. <br /> PS: I admit it: I shed a water of joy during the final scene.
