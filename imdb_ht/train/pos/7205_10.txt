Deathtrap is not a whodunit. He is someone who will do it to that first. It is so difficult to describe this movie without giving anything away so I will not mention more about the draw. As far as acting goes it is Cris Reeves's greatest role as Clifford, a young playwriter. You really see the series of ability to act in this movie from "exesing cheeseburgers" in frankly awesome. Clifford is such a difficult role to play and in the production of this stage I never saw Clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays it as a little puppy or a homicide maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen with the right character all the way through. As for Michael Caine it is ..... well it is Michael Caine. One of the best actors in the last 50 years and in this film as good as it ever was.
