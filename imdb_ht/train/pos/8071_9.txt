This film deals with the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and especially one person after he informed about a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences. Watching the movie, I got to feel that you could take the script with just a few minors, do it again and, sadly, would still fit contemporary events. But noticed should not be nearly as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he just received an Oscar) and a fine cast fine including most, if not all the actors and scrubs in Hollywood at the time, most of them recognizable characters are either established in the moment or just start out. A very good movie is well worth the look. Very recommended.
