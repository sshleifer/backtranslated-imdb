An interesting look at Japan before opening in the West. John Wayne as America's first consulate in Japan came in agreement with the agreement from Perry's humble diploma. It is not welcome. Wayne eventually garnered his meeting with the Shogun after carrying a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There followed a colorful procession in the capital carrying gifts for the Shogun, including a former Tanglefoot bottle. The meeting with the Shogun, debates among Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibition featured an interesting look at the politics of the period. All along a movie quite enjoyable and besides how often you get to see Duke losing a fight in a guy's half size.
