Richard Attenborough has already given us lovely films such as "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", once more surprise we make a beautiful hymn in the nature. Indeed, the vast and (at that time) unexplored territory in Canada helps compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes collected by the motion picture camera. If the movie is really based on a true story, once more it becomes clear that "people in vision" are, in fact, men who live beyond their time, and a historical perspective that only time gives them reason. The cinematography is breathtaking, such as lead cast by Pierce Brosnan, whose performance is due to Attenborough's master. A fun surprise is the appearance of Annie Galipeau in the role of Archie's beloved. The movie should appear in a list of people who really love the nature.
