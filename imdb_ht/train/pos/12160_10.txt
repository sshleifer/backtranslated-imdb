A vast black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies followed 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are young mothers convicted (a nod to 'Compulsion') that runs to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for their movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented children who went to mom's terrible steps. Debbie, in her blond wigs ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' saying to Winters) driving the tots of the concerts and having a wealthy father, Weaver. It also makes a delightful tango entertaining and, on the whole, gives an outstanding performance, unlike anything he would do before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comics and weird. It looks wonderful and details great periods (30 years). Many beautiful swipes in Hollywood and the headless film. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', it purrs, 'from r, but prophetic to it'. Watch it and love it.
