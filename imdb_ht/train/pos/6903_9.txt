This little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over. Dreyfus and Braga are masterfully, but Raul Julia steals the show! A long-in-a-kind cheeky, Gomez Addams, and just the right tone for this irreverent betting in this often-said story. <br /> <br /> Generally untrumpeted and unappreciated, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out the fact and join the fun going on up on the screen. Two thumbs up!
