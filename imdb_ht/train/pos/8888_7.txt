This film started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle. However, the fact that the movie runs past two nights breaks that momentum in its peak. The second part really was interesting, but then gave way to a merely tacky finish. Play football in the yard? Really, could he have found any more feelings and maudlin? Now I've heard plans for a similar film based on the '70s. I will not make any great melody effort into one if it's something like the "60s."
