So, throwing star Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who joins David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip from the west. The latter couple are researching the notorious murderer site for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serious assassin on the blaze (unbekownst Dave) and Juliette is her poor, not-all-companion. This is a good cast and the story moves together, but Pitt is not belivably scared as a serious assassin, although it is one of his earlier roles earlier. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes, who always managed to shine, whether in his role as `homicide: Life on the Street 'or in the series' Wonderland.'
