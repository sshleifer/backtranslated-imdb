This is the one movie to see if you are married or are a married couple. The film portraits of a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, jungle work and family. So called the "culture of death" that we will survive in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the cast and director .. Two thumbs and a 10 star rating from me!
