... this is a classic and very large dialogue with nobody should not miss. Nice story, treasure-in-the-skin dress status, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect, but it's funny; D Not paying attention to the rating, it's BS. Watch it, then look something like Final Destination (2009) and tell me Life Stinks worth the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be friends XD At this point I recommend the fourth quarter of "enticing the enthusiasm" to every fan of Brooks;) Vote 10 against the ignorant views of inworms! I made 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
