Some comments here on IMDb have compared dog classic dog classic dog bites to the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really slamming, Liquid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a look, especially if fearless, hard-side action is your thing. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-people traveling in Hong Kong murdering a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, the heartless commander who determines to follow it down, whatever the price. With Wai closing in on his target, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape ?? until he meets Yue, a very illegal immigrant who needs his help to save his life from abuse. <br /> <br /> A harsh Drama Drama with great movies, amazing sound design, a haunting note, and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as New Pei Pei as Pang's Love Interest), Dogs Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hit Asian hyper-violence (thinking about the Chan-wook Park Trilogy Triangle line). Stabbings, shooting, relentless noise: all happened regularly in this film and kept unflinchingly by director Cheang. <br /> Of course, this kind of story is destined to have a happy ending for everyone involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this movie dies (rather embarrassing death). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentionally) comedy, and at its end, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a recent scam-dramatic scene, Pang and Wai are close to fighting as a pregnant Yue looks like. Eventually, after all three were suffering from severe elbow injuries during the fracas, an injured Pang made a DIY Ceiling on a now dead Yue, delivering the baby's moments before he died. <br /> Whilst this movie might not be a classic 'classic' installment in Hong Kong beyond, with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth looking out.
