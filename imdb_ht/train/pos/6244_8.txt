Each country with a working movie industry has some lists (and maybe some crazy) artists that make movies that you can only fully understand when you're part of this country. I guess Hundstage is like a movie. <br /> You see the lowest level in the Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, weird, lovers. But they still have enough money to pay for rented cars and big houses. And they definitely do a lot of unusual things here that may seem like 'normal' because they're doing it in their entire lives. From a normal human point of view you can now easily follow the movie and be lousy or captivating and watch a fine piece of art in Austria's art cinema. <br /> But if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in Hundreds like toddler society. A society that will be more crazy from the day to day, creates its own rules that nobody else can understand, the cave's social system comes from. And you see the people. Sitting in the park, standing in the opposite street corner, passing through the same line. Maybe you meet 'em in a bar or disco you can visit. Maybe you work with them at work or they live next to your home. You begin to hate them without exactly knowing why. You will try to get away - but you can not. Maybe you will end up like them. But it seems 'normal' to you because you're doing it in your whole life now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright if Austria is one of the world's richest countries. It has nice people ... but some are also ugly. There are a lot of hard working people trying their best ... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying all that was the popular in Austria built so far. <br /> A very pessimistic movie.
