Folding it as Beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet there is a predictable line in general. It's about a girl named Jess who tries to realize her life long dreams to become a famous football player and finally gets the chance when offering a position to a local team. There are many limitations and limitations that it faces that keep it back again and always determine and strive. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a beautiful light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. Choices are really good, 'skip my kids, just move in up ... to your destination, and you make limits and hassle.' Anyway hope that was to help your needs in a review. Fold it like Beckham great flick
