> Unlike most comments I've read, I did not feel this to follow any of the other rock cinema ("Spinal Tap", etc.) The story was more unique, although I felt most people wanted to see "sex , drugs and stones and roll "screws that the band held for it. As an American, I knew a few of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea. Seeking to find out "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was at Zifferedi's (<sp?) Classic "Romeo & Juliet".
