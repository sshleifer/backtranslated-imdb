My companion and I both enjoyed this movie very much. The viewer is swept away from modern life in old Japan, while at the same time exposed to very current themes. Characteristics are realistic and detailed; It has an unpredictable finish and history, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-cemeteries in the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
