Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedy ever - probably the most funniest. Delirious is the best comedy stand-up I've ever seen and is a must-have for anyone who likes a good laugh !! I watched this film hundreds hundreds and every time I saw it - I always have side-divide fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will laugh very much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is hilarious! <br /> Although there are a lot of comic strips out there - after watching this comedy stand-up, most of them will seem like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it - get it, watch it - and you'll love it !! It will make you holler !!! :-)
