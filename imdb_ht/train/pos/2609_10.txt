I write 9 years after the final episode was revealed and I still reeling from the impact Wildside had on me. It has effectively gone where many other cop drives have gone and in place. But he took it further and did not lose from realism in the streets, often portraits of life events and characters down to a T. <br /> <br /> I seriously miss this set, rather than They give them the stupid "underbelly" that is about to dramatize and acting to create a whole load of American-scrambled garbage. <br /> <br /> Wildside has remained true to the uniqueness of Sydney and so I'm really indebted to this wonderful series. The act was A-class and it's a shame to see only a few actors have been strengthening their careers while others have changed color into holes. <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of TV history, so I ask the ABC to release the complete set of DVDs, not three at first. Give this series to be worth it.
