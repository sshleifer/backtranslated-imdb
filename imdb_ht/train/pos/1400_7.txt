Bogmeister and others have so many nails. Shore Coast is really TOS 'first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which would later be perfect with the classic and tribbles problem). He also provided both the Enterprise crew and its television viewers a clear need of the consequences to threaten the universe, for example, the Corbomite Manouever. Looking for a place to chill out for a while, the Enterprise is happening across a seemingly idyllic classic M planet, and sends an exploration team down to take a closer look. Soon enough all sorts of absurdity begin to take place - some seemingly harmful - but it all looks like a sick of emotional extremities that have been played out of a strange mix of fantastic mysteries (McCoy went to the ice looking), psychological thriller (Kirk is arrested not an unbearable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment). TOS was the least serialized throughout the series of franchises in trekking, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first quarter focused on heavy-handed, dangerous dramatically. Unlike reliable reliable franchise writers, the TOS production team did not fear literally going where no TV set went before. And Shore Coast, despite its occasional issues, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner - ironic gives sense to its legendary humor) did not seem to know how to handle this new rip off ST's theme. The last scene is perhaps one of the worst scenes I can remember from running across TOS - both composition and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation - to see it while watching all the first quarter as it meant to be seen - it's the order.
