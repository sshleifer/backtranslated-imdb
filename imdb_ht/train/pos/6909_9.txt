... and if you're very, very good it will look like Moon Over Parador. This movie has a little funny story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the filing and acting was spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / empowerer, full of all the little neuroses and vanity you imagine the actors there. You get a glimpse of what the actors like behind the scenes. <br /> This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, as her character has the best role she imitates the dead dictator! And the separate scene: like something from Casablanca, indeed! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was superb as Chief of the Parade of Secret Police. It gets some really funny lines, some of them are homage to other films, such as "Round up the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girl friend - in addition to being a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for the evening!" <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as CIA's agent and the stars invited several play heads: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all perfectly done. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable lighting under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
