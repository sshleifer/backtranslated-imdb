A classic Hollywood Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Strong and DeNiro both provide genuine spectacular performances in two driving roles, and the support cast is exactly the same as the excellent performance by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. Only "nit" I could choose is that Theron's role was needed and distracted (by his performance was fine, just that the movie seemed to add two scenes needed to accommodate his role.) / Aside from that, the characters, dynamics, and actions of the real-life story are fixed and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and how these experiments evolved the beings are uniquely characterized by the performing artists. Despite the extreme film length, the rhythm remains intact at all. The note is also terrific. <br /> We are a predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. So Mike Leigh addicts should remove a star, but everyone else should be strong.
