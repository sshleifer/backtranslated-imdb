I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews of this movie's sheep. This film was not designed to be a "deep thinking" movie, which is what the vast majority of reviews seem to think it should be. In fact, it would appear that if any movie does not produce a life-changing insight, with a deep, twisted, self-boggling plot, they would give it a 1 or 2. Do not waste a movie because you do not like genre, people. This movie was a Action / Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended. And for a comedy / comedy, it was very well done. I was actually rather surprised that I loved it as much as I did, which never really was a fan of Jamie foxx, and who has the over-use scheme that he has. <br /> <br /> The draw was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and threw into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc. etc.) but it was heated over with a bit of a technological twist. Now, the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the real "bad guy" is a uber-geek. Jamie Foxx actually plays a silly comedy, while at the same time rather smart and serious main character, and did not try too much humorous side of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep hide scheme as in the "Matrix" or a drama like "In Mouse and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced talent, and an occasional twist of humor in the air, this movie will not disappoint you. I would normally have rated it on an 8 (on the same level as the Hard Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a try 10 and bring the note up to what it should be. <br />
