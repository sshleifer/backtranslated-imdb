His choice of films, the basic 'conceit' of the production (which puts him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on) with his brilliant delivery! But if you want Freud, you must know that you're getting the Zizek version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas and gusto and in a compelling way. The rubber is it is also quite mercurial and so there may be more of his gusto than in real content. Cinematical, it is a gem. Psychologically, this will have people at all compelling (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) scratching their heads, but reaching for the popcorn all the same. Zizek is a phenomenon icon and pop for itself.
