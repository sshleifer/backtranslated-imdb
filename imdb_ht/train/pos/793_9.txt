I really really enjoyed this movie. (That's why he surprised me that he got such a low rating from many users of this site!) I'm not saying he's a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cool, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, intense, and a great story of ups and downs of lasting girl friends in difficult moments and bad things that female friends tend to do in each other! (Fess up ladies, we all ALL WANT!) Bill Paterson shines as Gerald Marsden's reverend and Andie McDowell prove he can be a fine actress when the role is right and he puts his ideas into it. (And really, there is the best "escaped wedding" that I have ever seen or dreamed up in this movie ... more intestinal than anyone I've ever known!) You will laugh and you will cry ignoring any marketing campaign and how this movie is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should make tones in box office. (Now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
