I have not read the other reviews about the movie, but judging from the average rating I can see that they're unlikely to be very complementary. <br /> I watch it for the second time with my kids. They absolutely love it. True, she did not have growns to roll on the floor, but the sound of fun kids did it looks so. It's a true Mel Brooks mashed up, and many moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are, and how to seek them are our friends and associates. There are many other films on a similar topic, no doubt, many of which will have a greater comical or emotional impact on adults. It is difficult for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family, however. <br /> Hence, for the kids, an 9/10 from me.
