Hey man, what's up. I am the only person, and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ you can not really write a review on Sakura script, cause there we did not have one. As far as I know, the story has just been made up as we went along. I had the best time in my life to make that movie, and got so much stank that I ran out of Jism ........... fun times. So happy that we all enjoyed the movie. I really did not get the battles I was considering. Whenever I set up some moves, the battle director keeps changing. Still, I had an explosion and met some really great people. Especially the black violet girl who seems to fall into the movie-making scene.
