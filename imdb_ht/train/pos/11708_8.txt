The reason why people say that this scary movie is because it did !! That means the movie goal was felt by a few people who saw it. When I first saw this film she scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a movie and film movie film, but the kind that you would think it might be possible for things to happen the way the film was written. Of course non-believers will say only a sci-fi movie. Truth is, this movie is a must have for your thrill collection, even if it has a religious view. If you are a fan of classic evolators (Omen..etc) this is one of them and one to have. I have never seen the end (Thunder), but I believe he chooses where this movie ends.
