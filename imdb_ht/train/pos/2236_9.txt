Things I remember most about this movie is that it was used on air on local TVs KTLA (Ch. 5) during each Christmas season during the mid-late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near Christmas Eve. It was still a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl went on, being Lone survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian forest. The graphic scene of this girl pulls leeches from infected legs has made quite an impression on this young viewer. Not quite the kind of Christmas applaud I used to see at the moment. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production.
