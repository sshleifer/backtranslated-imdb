*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two (such as "Force Magnum" and the "Anforcer"), Harry's room seemed to strangle his stride to "devastating impact" wisely in his strength: charisma in Clint Eastwood, who also directed, with a story that spends just enough time on display and spares his energy for the big scene. <br /> <br /> For once, the case took Harry outside his native San Francisco (where he was again in trouble with his superiors to "shoot first, ask questions later" tactic), in the rural in San Paulo. There, a group of lowlifes was gruesomely murdered, one at a time, not a gang-rapist man-year-old man, and whose sister was in a state of catatonia ever since the attack. /> <br /> The assassin is described by Sondra Locke, and it makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bleeding. Locke's cold eyes and frosty voices, when either trying to encourage the hospital's sister or dependency in the rapisty direction, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman who is wrong with years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear fruit deadly. > <br /> Rachrist is a very jerky, especially the leader, who has "psychic nutjob" practically jumping on his forehead, and a lesbian that seems almost one of the men, despite his anatomical inability to participate. The flashback scene, while not graphically clear, is enough nightmare, and clearly intended to cheer at Jennifer's audience as he kills his striker .. Some will reject "sudden attack" as waste: a stupid, storytelling manipulative. On a certain level this is true, but it's well-done waste. What works in the film's advantage is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, giving you a complex character with the most visible injuries in painting it passes through her gestures or speeches. What we have here is a movie action with a point of view. <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some are worthy to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the killings becomes clear to Harry (a realization that, wisely, does not spell out with dialogue) It is presented with a choice - what to do about an assassin whose motivation it can sympathize with but whose conduct is tied to law does not tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the Harry salary salary fare. The other movie cinema is Eastwood's direction. This is, after all, a Harry Movie Hall, and Eastwood knows the character is better than anyone else. The movie is directed with style and understanding, and edited to give the stage a strong corporate action. Some of the best "Harry moments" in the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead - Do My Day." Sudden Impact is a movie that has the courage to convince her to present a story about a jerk crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a fixed detective story, well done and well said. And it is certainly never dull. On these criteria, he succeeded greatly.
