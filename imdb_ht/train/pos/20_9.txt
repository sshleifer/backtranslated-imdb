'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it's the riddle to know and realize his potential. For Iris, she's got to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, beginning and standing, before each have their agility and courage to fully trust each other and move on. In this regard it is very nicely giving us a good look at how life is often, so being credible. Unlike some other reviews I've found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture. Thrust support is also selected carefully and adds a depth of character to the main characters to get added meaning from the supported performance. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing I take from it is hope.
