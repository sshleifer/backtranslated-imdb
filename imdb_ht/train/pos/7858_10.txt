TESTS in the STORM country is perhaps the best movie in all of Mary Pickford's films. Within two hours, it was a long time for a 1922 silent film again to keep your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a "greatest hit" performance and bits of the innocent Mary, the Little Mary demon, Mary the little spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine , etc. features that are often used throughout a single movie in the past. The movie is amazingly Frankly on an illegitimate child support character for 1922 and at our Little Mary point, the mother unwed in question! If the Academy Awards were around in 1922, no doubt Oscar's best silly for the year would have been Mary.
