I had a heck at a good time watching this photo, and it was surprisingly surprised at its more readiness features. The first, the movie is endlessly costly designed with its carton sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The chains act out of very poor (two parts), barely professional (Herb Evers as the leading man), Gothic overstatement (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) first-rate and Virginia Leith in the title role as victims of headless living Against it will be the benefit of science and passionately lustful fiance. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie in this ilk. There are so many problems about science and medicine in our lives and what boundaries should be. This movie is a movie in many ways. However, not too misleading by its real intention. It's a smile story about a man obsessed with his skills in medical science that wants to slip alongside his dead girlfriend with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is the sax music that resonently strongens whenever the doctor renews the city for beautiful girls.
