I think the creator (s) of this movie concept deserve a lot more than they probably got. It's not an Oscar caliber film of course, but at least for me, this movie has left a lasting impression since I first saw it back in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> I do not think this is (and hope that's not) a stove, but: imagine acting on your impulse. Make first thoughts that pops in yourself, saying the first words on your mouth ... There is no constraint, no conscious, nothing to keep you back from saying or doing things that, as adult intelligent , we know we should not actually say or do. If anything, this movie only scratches the surface - It does not go as far as it can go. <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with rapping older "classic" attempts and cash in on today, would not it be nice to see they noticed an older movie of modest success, for the sake of take it to the next level? A bit further, or even to explore what the original crew did not, would not or could not deal with 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion anyway. : o)
