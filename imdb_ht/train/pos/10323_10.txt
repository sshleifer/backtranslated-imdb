This is a very fun movie. A few of the reviews that I read on this forum were written by people, apparently, thinking that the movie was an effort in serious drama. He did not do it ... It's a very enjoyable movie, made in a language of strangely way. All the actors obviously have fun while entertaining us. The battle sequences are alive, animated and, above all, not free. The so-called "Green Death", used on a couple of occasions, is not, as I read in a review, "gruesome". A couple of revisions were very critical in the martial arts battle between doc and sea near the end of the movie. Hey, lighten up ... Again, I remind one and all that is a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" was captioned, which adds to the fun aspect. The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of the martial movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guy" (sea) is faced with. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you'll spend 100 minutes in a more enjoyable way.
