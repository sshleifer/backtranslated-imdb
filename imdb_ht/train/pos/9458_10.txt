This is a sublime piece of film-making. It flows in just the right pace at all. Music accompanying it fits perfectly and is very pleasing to the ear. The funny comics are hilarious and made even more so by the unpretentiously tragic nature of the movie. <br /> However, despite many comments on the tragedy inherent in the storyline it was nothing but depressing for me to look. I enjoy it in such a way that I have no experience for a long time. That is, it is superb and yet without all the common comets of modern films; gender, violence, and special effects that are not needed. <br /> <br /> 'Teeth in real life' lacks anything for being without the regular screws. It has a fully matured plot that just does not require, and indeed should be lost, any more decorations. At the same time, the term is entirely adult. It's a piece of art and in itself that incubators you entirely and want to have nothing more than it already offers. <br /> There are some scenes that feel a bit walton, but these actually make perfect sense of running in length as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. The rosary makes way for the tragic that then gives on the idyllic darkening etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lethality-like stability. The thorns and chews are gentle, but more than adequate in the pleasure of pencil. <br /> I highly recommend watching this film whatever your genre is normally enjoying. Save any prejudice because this is a must see!
