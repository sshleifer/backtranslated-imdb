....... Play Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was beautiful wide out and a cry. I love watching him communicating with Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whatever - it's clear he's got a ball and I think he's made it easier to invite him as well - as long as they know ahead of his time did not discipline, 19 produce quality. Relax and be loose was the name of the game. <br /> It makes me guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis too. Great distribution, former gang who held audiences in stitches for decades, enjoyed absolute what he did. Sly her sad little play that was good too - but in a touching way. <br /> <br /> Personally I think it's great, having just bought a DVD from its show series at '61 or so, it brings it back to a fan for me. I can remember seeing him on television at the end of his running when he was fluid up the series in 1971 or so. Check out this if you're a fan or curious. It was a riot.
