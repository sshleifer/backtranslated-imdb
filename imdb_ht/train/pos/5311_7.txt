John Waters is the most accessible film date is one of his best, consider it off on all of the campaign and vulgarite outright that seems to litter most of his previous work. Sure, the stripping and the sexual references are still there, at least it's presented in a fashion <br /> <br /> that can not be judged too bad or disgusting. Due to some great choices casting, this film carried out the silliness associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern art. Funny and slightly lighthearted (if that's possible for Waters), this is one of those films I would look on a rainy day.
