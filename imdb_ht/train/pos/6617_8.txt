Animation always seems to be fringe. In Japan, this might not be the case, but in Europe and more so in the USA animation has a huge fat "KIDS" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comical-liberal countries, the classic house as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you never read, it's not too late. There's no upper limit -On them and do not carry nerd-stigma in DC or Marvel) It looks natural a movie like this one pops up in France. It suits my image of prejudice in the French as art-loving, anti-USA-oriented and talented movie-makers. Luckily there are also "A Dark Scanner" out of the superstar that see - looks like art is pretty much international. So, every way, as you might have seemed Renaissance is artsy and french. If you are a normal person you will find that fear. There is no need for that however! Below it's cool, sweet dark cell appearance has a good thriller and a good movie in general. This is one of my fears for this film. It's so easy to turn the spectacular animation into a gadget, much like Sony & C: I'm doing with the Pixar RIP-compromises. I was expecting a confusion, sometimes boring and not very engaging film, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> I would love it anyway for these neo-noir things, but it was good that it was refreshing on this level too. NOTE: I saw the French dub was OK as far as I could see. English might be more interesting than that with Craig and everything. <br /> A final word of praise to the animation. He was scared. Futurist, well-crafted, nice camera-work, clever solution (eyes for example look very good, which is hard to do) and so visually stunning I felt like bursting out "This is so awesome fashion!". Then again, I really love animation and I appreciate the studio's effort to put down, so my verdict is somewhat biased. <br /> <br /> Good movie anyway, definitely living beyond it's "gadgets".
