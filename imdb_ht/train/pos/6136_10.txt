I love bedding and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a tears of joy every time I have the magnificent pleasure to see it. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love it very much. Many have said. I have 27 copies of video and I love them all equally. I love everyone who loves it. I like you. My favorite scene is the dance scene in Port-au-Prince. I learned the dance movements and practice it every day. I have some audio recordings in my own song. If anyone can play the drums or guitars I think of forming a sleeve and broomsticks band.i hope to call it the 'handles'. my love (liz)
