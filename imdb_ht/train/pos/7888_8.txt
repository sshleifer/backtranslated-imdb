Freddy Krueger rules the dream from returning street elm, great English character's actor Robert is back at the end of this nightmare 5, dreaming child.i hope I got the number correctly.There were many, and this one is one of the best, especially for cameos; Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, johnny depp, (who made the very first nightmare in 84) alice cooper (singer) you will see Freddy as a teaser child, a teenager who loves pain, and as a family guy (creepy) effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer (travel trip) yaphet kotto (aliens, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) one of the 3who people saw this in 3d, well ending.i love 3D movies were missing the first wave of the 3D in 1953 (I'm not even born again) the second wave was in 1983.i like all the Freddy films. This one means from one of the best not to count the first that was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster in the 80s and 90s, along with Jason Vorhees, Chucky, Micheal myers, and face.can face imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike. That Freddy is like a up.8 out of 10.
