Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a beautiful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity, and globalization of iron and tossing in shades. I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Boston, and it was hoping a globalization of globalization, but that I was to have been a fixed visual display of shocking legs in both China and the United States. The eye-opening film is funny, in-depth, serious, non-patronizing, and leaves you wanting more as the role of credit. It is worth compared to Murderball - it's simply that well done. Young women in China have different points of view, and the owner is amazingly open to discipline. Fishermen during the carnival are the highlight, but only because this film is excellent in terms of depth within the factory in China without narration. Bravo in the movie theater to get inside and finish the movie! I would never think about connecting between shovels, china, and New Orleans; Now I think about the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality, and pleasure. Most importantly, I can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this movie, unlike other films on globalization that I've seen.
