What a delightful movie. Characters were not only alive but alive, real life mirrors everyday life and accounts of a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could be closely associated with someone who knows about their own family or circles of close friends. <br /> <br /> The story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can accumulate in and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops. The script does a great job to capture the common emotions, actions and responses of the characters in conflict, opinion, and resolve. <br /> It's not a season, but it's a very nice movie to watch with loved ones. Many top nods and 'ahhh' moments are shared and enjoy.
