Solino really moved me with her deeply drawn character. While being a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hatred or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi went on specifically when he was to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on going to the premium movie festival His movie ceremony came in. To see this character struggling between his artistic dreams and his natural sense of duty his mother was so frustrated. Even at the end when he made one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past the walls to reach their children. I could even identify with the brother Giancarlo, who while being more self-assured with older brother, was very insecure. A really nice movie that makes me laugh and cry.
