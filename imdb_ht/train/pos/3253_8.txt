Not a movie that must be taken seriously, but a great movie again. <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. Acting, IMO, is excellent. One of those films you would not go out of the way you see, but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance. <br /> - - - - - - - - -
