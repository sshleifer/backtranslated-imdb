At this first film came back in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to see this film, which was not much more than a prolonged music video. The act was very bad, but what can you expect from musicians to act on the big screen for the first time? Despite this, it was still a very entertaining movie! Morris Jou and Jerome Benton give some ever classic comedies, especially the pronouns of the "Password", which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing "who's the first" baseball routine. <br /> Appolina (who went to a single name then) gives some nice breasts, so you've had the short stripping to cover. Plus, it's very attractive. And of course, the band of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later on was a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at that particular time in his career, he was at the top of his toys. This movie does not rank in all the time great categories, but it is very fun.
