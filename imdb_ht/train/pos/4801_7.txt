I watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white television. I remember my father noticing that "this is how it might happen - Adam and Eve." I lightly remember the scene when Adam found Eve, his eyes were blackened. I asked my father why he was black and said he was tired of hunger. Did you not see this episode of 45 years, I still remember it - the TV transmissions return with ideas to the home planet, the bomb scene shake the headquarters, and the final stage of the market, Adam brings pack it with these eves. It may not have been a theater work of art, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
