I thought the "soul soul" was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with some outstanding performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was an episode of the series (without the humor) it would probably be one of my favorite stand-alone stories in the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've always preferred Christian Scoggins, although granted JMS did not write it as well for much of the series and he had to endure the Byron / Telepath scheme. If you take out the smutty humor on the brothel and the "poorest" actors in these scenes, then this film is solid stuff. Probably my third favorite of the four movies, but in no means bad at all.
