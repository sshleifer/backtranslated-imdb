Well, some people would say that this particular film feels ... but hey! That's not good, not good at al ... The film may not have the best special effects, and they can not have the best actors (Except the Excess of Barbarian Bros.) Dispite the Small Thought Factor, I Can Honostly Say That This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen em al!
