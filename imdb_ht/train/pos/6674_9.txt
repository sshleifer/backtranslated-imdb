The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how this movie would be so popular? I found this movie adorable and humorous by his statue as a logic defying bomb. Well, I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit, and you can count me amoung it to the fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving too much, this movie makes for comic books what "Princess Bride" made for fairy tale and "Framed Roger Rabbit?" made for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the movie's tone then the marketing committee it was unfortunately signed (this is one of those cases as the "Iron Giant" where the studio had no signs what he was about to do). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a bit offbeat. You will not listen to BeeGees in the same light ever again.
