If this was done earlier in the Zatoichi series it could be one of the best. It's good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the range at this point. The situation is very intriguing: farmers in the province have two champions, a favorite boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange; Both run into usual local gangsters, who want their crops to fail because it increases gambling revenues and lures them to snap up some countries; The rulers or powerful allies are a puritanian who looks like drunk and gambling but secretly indulges his own appetite. (It also looks like Dracula, as the bandits in later movies Zatoichi tend to do more and more.) These characters have enough meaning to deserve to be placed against Zatoichi as it was originally drawn, but not now he lost much of his nuances, and the changes to some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man killed Zatoichi, needed more time then the movie was given, so that the story Looks like choppy, as if some scenes were missing. Otherwise, the film shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vivid, credible, and unassuming landscape (the absence of which is evident in the occasional episode where directors just miss it), and a high quality technique in his disguise nature itself: the imaginative use of varied sets of boundaries for the boundaries seems to exist. And of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, does it all work. This must be one of the best-sustained series of film stories.
