This was the eighth film and final Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from cinemas and died the following year. It's still a thriller thriller, the car carried on without him perfectly, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories of the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scenarios are often still at atmospheric, but it was not the only Whistler himself who hung it all along the screen, Dix also did. Couple left out for a whole knuckle to get the encouragement of getting married in the rain pouring but shouted again when the potential bride first disappeared then discovered already married before she apparently went mad. Is the potential gaffe cut off, even when the private dick was hired to find it suddenly his bullets, lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting is the question. Michael Duane in her penultimate film is OK if a bit of a vlimp, Lenore Aubert's wonderful time at the movie Abbott & Costello meets Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was as wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the outing only where the Whistler itself must have been wet from sneaky over in the rain, unless it has been sprayed with sea foam in voices. A lot happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual of fans of the genre like me. Whistler radio series began in 1942 carried on until 1955 clock up nearly 700 half hour displays, almost all of which are available on mp3 and based on what I've heard so far of all of them well worth listening.
