I gave this movie a 10/10 and some reluctance as it's hard to praise something so frightening and scary for years. The sheer threat to the woman in the dark face is just the most horror and the accompanying music just worsen the fear. I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really was my disaster for years. I am fascinated by the fact that many other users have said this too. So many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a movie might be but you can believe everyone who posted on this board, this really is extremely incredible thing. I mean I really like horror movies and generally find them quite funny more often than not, but this really is ominous and will probably disrupt most people. I have not seen her since I was 10 and I'm tempted to look at her again, but fear I might have some nights sleeping. I can not properly put my finger on what it is exactly, but I think it is something to do with the fact that pair is the biggest weapon Woman and that we, as viewers, are just as tender as we feel we are afraid of intense. It is remarkable that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. I also saw the stage play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can be compared to this.
