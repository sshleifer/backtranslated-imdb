When I was little, my parents got this movie for me to watch. I really love it, and I look it over and over again. Even though I was in 3rd grade I was still watching it from time to time. Recently, I watched it again, just for nostalgia relief, and even though the show was not targeted for my age group (I'm young adolescent), I still find it fun and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others. Some parts I found quite fun. Also, this shows no bad content, so you can let the kids alone with this show and do not worry about picking up any bad language or shelves. I would recommend that.
