PROJECT YEAR (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Funny very funny concept on Andy Stitzer's title (beautifully played by Carell's second-year end to an incredibly funny performance performance ensuring his stratosphere in the A-list), a reps technology service for an electronics shop in southern California that is found out On his secret identity by a trio of good meaning yet entirely clueless chef peasant workers (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one funnier degree than the next) determined to find the deflowered friends no matter the price. What follows is an easy, very warm-hearted romance with a living mom (the wonderful Keener who has plenty of fun here) that leads to adding more fuel to the fires of Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited comedy with unapologetically raunchy romantic; The Funniest since "There's Something About Mary" with a watchful script is observed by the director of Judd Apatow and Carell who features some astoundingly gut-busting suites including an accurate joke David Caruso joke, homophobic debate, send-ups to 'date -a-palaozas' and demeaning the war of gender and cheeky aplomb. A true winner with an instant classic; The funniest movie of the year.
