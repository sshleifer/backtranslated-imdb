In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great film directors and great pioneers, creates a gem in light comedy that has all its lightness an unmistakable and technically brilliant film that clearly influences subsequent films like Marx Brothers , Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. The plot, a witty story of a poor artistic artist who has a lottery pottery but is in search of frantically all over town for the missing ticket, is basically just a device supporting a series of beautiful funny comic scenes adopted in a dream world in the imaginary director. <br /> One of the most impressive things about this movie is that, though it's placed in the middle of Paris and it's nothing actually impossible, it achieves a tendency and involvement in fairy / story / fantasy, in which it looks quite natural that people sing as much as they talk, or that a tussle on a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what can be a fake opera on the movie (Oh Blond-Twist Soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!") Also a pleasure is the casting: Clair has assembled a group In amazing, different character actors, each of them illustrates the deadly satire of a French bourgeois "kind," so that the film looks like a daumier depressed series coming to life. <br /> <br /> The gravity takes a moment to get rolled, and I found the characters not as emotionally engaged as they can even be in a light comedy (as they are, for example, in many Lubitsch films.) For these reasons I refuse to give it the highest rating. But these minor caverns should not be distracted from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> You should see it? By all means. Very recommended if you want a classic and influential work in movies or just a fun comedy.
