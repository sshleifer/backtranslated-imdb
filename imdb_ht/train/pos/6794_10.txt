I read in most of the comments posted here & all I can say that most of these posters have major issues in their lives. Show this, unlike most show games, was fun. Mr. Shatner, who is clear of all he does, was again struck by the show. It is truly bright and bright as a beacon wherever it goes. It's fun & makes you smile & that's exactly what's the show. Dancers and questions, the round-up mode will only feature the appendage show. And even though there is a great deal of money at his stake of fun. The stress (stress) that exists in most game shows does not exist here. Several people who posted messages complain how many times they were and from time to time & choose questions, & c, like millionaires do not have the same storm time. All I can say is most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun & love yourself. There's something for everyone. Qustions test your knowledge, candy eyes (dancers), suspense, Mr. Shatner's wonderful personality ... well if that does not just go up, then I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. From all the show games that have ever been over, and to be quite Frank, I hate show games, this is the one I really liked & really miss. Only show in other games I ever liked Match game.
