This is a movie that should be seen by anybody interested in, not effecting, or suffering from a food disorder. It's an amazingly sensitive and sensitive painting of bulimia in a young girl, its cause and its symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actors working today in today's cinema, Alison Lohman, who was later spectacular in the 'Where is the Lies of Truth'. I would recommend this movie to be shown in all schools, as you will never see a better one on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one marvels in her ability to convey the heart of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If Barometer tells us air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us emotional pressure and precision. His emotional range is so precise, each scene could measure microscopically for its graduation in trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and despair that has come to unbearable intensity. Winningham tie is the perfect choice to play his mother, doing so with immense sympathy and a series of emotions as being finely tuned as Lohman. Together, they make a pair of emotional sensitive oscillators vibrated in resonance with each other. This movie is really an amazing success, and director Katt Shea should be proud of her. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like best movie films, this is after all animal behavior in the sharp corner. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a fermented soul can destroy its own body into a despair of despair. But if we do not sympathize with those who suffer from the depths of despair, then we are dying inside.
