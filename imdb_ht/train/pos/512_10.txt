"Stairway in the Sky" is an exceptional invention of film making, probably never duplicated. I rank it with the "Oz Wizard" and "African Queen," although it is a total type of film than "African Queen." "Heavenly Stair" is a psycho-drama that uses concept performance and technical effects that, in my knowledge, are totally unique. For example, there is the combination of B & W and color feet - as in "Oz", but the meaning of the contrast goes way beyond simple but beautiful - the effect achieved by "Oz." The "stairwells" goal and effect of the contrast can be described only as powerful. Another brilliant aspect of "stairs" is the concept of "time" and the way it is used here. How could anyone have become pregnant in a better way to make time stand still ?? literally? Then there is stairs to itself! <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. "Staircase in the sky" is a true gem.
