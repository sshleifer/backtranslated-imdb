While I did not agree with Bob's decision and Tammy gave up Jesse's baby, and it's something I'd never do, tried to do what was best for the baby. This way this film is written, you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and ask yourself what you really believe, from all different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unusual, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie he really convinced you that it's psychotic, or at least, that there's something seriously wrong with him. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed." The movie seems to finish quickly, leaving things a bit unresolved. But other than that, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to look when you just want to kick back and relax and look something nice that will make you laugh. But it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, seeing things from other people's perspectives, and discovering a little something about yourself. Caution: You can even grow while watching this movie! And it's all worth it, in the end.
