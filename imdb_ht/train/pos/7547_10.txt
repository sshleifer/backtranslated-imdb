The first cat soup seems to be a very random animated movie. The best way I could explain it is that it's quite acidic. Even though it's not entirely random. The story is about Nyatta, a young boy and his niece Nyaako. My son is very sick and dead, however, Nyatta sees his soul taken away by death and can retrieve half of it. The story is about their quest to bring Nyaako back into life. Though a lot of the content of this movie looks completely random, is not. Most of it is symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references to other accounts, such as Hansel and Gretal. The very beautiful movie has an interesting story, filled with a deeper meaning than what you see on the screen.
