Watching "The Fox and the Child" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and beauty in the environment and characters leave me in a gem of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The draw is simple. Cheerful simple. In this vessel is the simplicity of a unfolding world that draws you in and leaves you without breath. <br /> I laugh. I cry. I learned. <br /> This is a movie you can trust the mind - give yourself to them. Let me say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - at any age - and reveals the world of new eyes, as if to see in the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that Art draws the visualizer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel I was privileged to watch - no, to participate - this movie, a work of real art.
