My only minor minor and the movie I grew up to know as STAIRWAY FOR SKY, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY has embellished the past twenty minutes or so at the trial scene. And the judgment itself, IMO, is the most interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are beautifully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY that provides the liveliest and most credible performance. French accentuated MARIUS GORING is a pleasure (it even comes in a remake of Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sends claim to death when death is being signaled due to a supervision. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish. <br /> Seeing the evening on TCM for the first time in twenty years or so, I think it's a superb example of what a wonderful 1946 was for films. The photography technique, somewhat submitted and not garish at all, is excellent and its way to the B & W schedule for the heavenly sequences to make with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer of the fantasy aspects of the story - with Niven's tense talk and radio operator Hunter while his plane is collision in the direction of the earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Really a wonderful movie from the start of the end, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
