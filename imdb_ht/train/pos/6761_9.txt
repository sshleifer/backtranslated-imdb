Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews Cycle in the Noir Movie are among the (largely) jewelry jewelery in the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may seem out of place at the time, but the clear-eyere imagery, the complexity and identity, virility and representation, the grant of traditional psychological, the geometric style, all looks modern modern today, and much like Melville. The lukewarm ironies of this film are so packed, brutal and ironic that ends 'happy' is one of the hardest in Hollywood history. Brilliant on the amusing enthusiasts level as well, tense, and dual-side dialogue.
