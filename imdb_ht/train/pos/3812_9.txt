This is a real eye candy. A world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Large monsters that have preferred methods of attack are hurling cathedral of their opponents ... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of heroes mistakes and a beautiful princess in search of her hero ... familiar sounds ...? Yes, we've heard this song first. But you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery. This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema you will want to see a little more story. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year-circle? What drove the crazy knight? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and town ... and why are they fallen apart? And apart from that a lot of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it does not have any Lord of the Rings.
