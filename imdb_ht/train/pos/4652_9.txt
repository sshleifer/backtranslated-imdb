I think this film is well done and realistic. Here you are used to watch Hollywood "action" movies, and use that as a standard rate of this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what lifts it higher than the average stock movie. I have no Swedish military experience and can therefore not point out any errors in the way they act. But as I saw "extra" I am convinced that there was doing so much to avoid any errors. This is a movie I will recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.
