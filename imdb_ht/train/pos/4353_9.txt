So fortunate we have seen this fantastic film at the Palm Springs Film Festival Festival. Upon entering the theater we have submitted a few input cards that could be used for our personal rating in the movie. Looking at the card I came back to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life think you can miss as superb? Only about 5 for me." But then watch the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the spectacular spectacle of the movie environment in New York State, I slowly start bumping the movie up a category at a time. Certainly it was good, but the totally natural repeat of the actors with a winning performance award by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a plain detective set rather than this movie, the movie jumps to the excellent level. /> At the end of the movie there were some dry eyes in the house and hearts I'm usually stoically and happy to melt just like the Grinch and I ended up giving this a superb. <br /> This picture is a must for anyone with a parent. There is no violence or nudity but there are some strong language.
