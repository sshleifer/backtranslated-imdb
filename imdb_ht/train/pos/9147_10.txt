As a great Prince of Time in the last three to four years, I really can not believe I've just just got the rounds of "The Purple Rain". The brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition brought me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching her, but I was not prepared for just how electric she actually was. Prince's music performance throughout the film is nothing short of surprising - it really has the movements of this one. I'm very familiar (from repeatedly listened to) with the classic "Purple Rain" album with all its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie completely transforms your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, lovely ONES THAT, WHY THE CRYENE AND ALL WHEN ONLY. There is something unthinkable hypnotising on the scenes where Prince and the Revolution do. The conclusion of my BABY song is a STAR and I would die for U shows how much energy and talent talent Prince has been debited and in the middle of his 20s (he was overflowing!), He blew me away. He even makes Michael Jackson unanimously even in his peak year. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl in your dreams - drive it to a lake, make it jump in, then drive through - absolutely hilarious stuff in heat. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very year 1980 and hilarious impulses but this adds to the overall film charm. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when it's time to make the beast you get to see Morris Days and Jerome Benton light up the Minneapolis funk style step - I love to dance in this bit, and how Benton provided Morris with a mid-performance glass. <br /> I already can not wait to watch it again, I really can not! The extracts are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills couple admitting it to a "Prince grouping".
