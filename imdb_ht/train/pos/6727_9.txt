I realized a couple of days ago that the musicians in this movie put a play on words in his title. This film is not primarily about the acts of "giants," but especially on those who are great in the sport, riding great, changing the emphasis. <br /> <br /> In my youth lived a block from the Wedge, one of the toughest-breaking spots and best bodysurfing in the world. I came from navigating 15-to-18 feet, and they were dogs and were covered by waves of 10 and 12 feet on many occasions. This experience is why I'm in the dull waves of the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, in all appearances of a normal mortal, was able to get away with Maverick's ride by HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my hands. The first safety rules of any water sports are "Never navigate / dip / swim in your head." He went to the place where the sane people would not, and he was living on it. I would not go out if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot in the waves of Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my whole body. These are not just awesome waves, these are uncontrolled-intestinal evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60-foot waves (I can hardly qualify these), but actually working to face such a fun day at Rincon, I'm moving away. There is a dedication and focus of large-scale passenger who is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it was negligible to mention that there was a huge wave of vagaries in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserve to mention. Splice at Ken Bradshaw at Outboard Cabin Log with a 10 it is!
