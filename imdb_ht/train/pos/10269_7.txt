In the spirit of the classic "Sting", this movie hit where it really hurts ... in the heart! A premium, good female psychiatrist, hunger for adventure, meets up with the dirtiest and rotten in weakness. The doctor is vulnerable to the badman's career, and begs to be involved in his surgery. While the movie moves the "slow" type, it's climax and ends up stunning! You will especially enjoy how the doctor "forgives himself"!
