I saw this movie by chance, just because I went to a phase where I had a new admiration found for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank God I did ! This movie has stuck with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story turns on two girls who embark on a dramatic journey into a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their journey ended a more complicated story. The battles go in as they were arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. The act is amazing, the extraordinary images, the soundtrack is fantastic and so the right of the movie and the message is transmitting definitely powerful. I actually can not even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people do not appreciate as much as I do not rating in the movie but I swear, this one you have to see !!! I promise it will stick with you!
