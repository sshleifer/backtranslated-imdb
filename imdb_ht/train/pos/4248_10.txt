There is a story, but more essentially, the world of this movie begins to mess and comes in command over the course of ten minutes. <br /> It is a celebration of life and an optimistic affirmation of true purpose and goodness. Representing an incomplete incompetence in previous movies, this film should be taught at every high school. <br /> <br /> * CHIASMUS *
