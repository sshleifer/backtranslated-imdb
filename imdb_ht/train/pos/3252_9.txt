The story of "A woman from nowhere" is rather simple and pretty much suited right from an Eastwood Western Spaghetti: A mysterious stranger comes in an unlimited city run by a kingpin and begins to shoot up the place. Even the credits are open and music has spaghetti feel: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone should be proud. Twisting really interesting is that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the place is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this shareholder, there is a considerable amount of gunplay, some of it's good, some predictable, and some hokey somewhat different, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko manages his weapons with credibility and aplomb and gives them thugs because of them. It was not a lot of a challenge to act for it as it was a physical challenge, but it did handle things very well. He shows that he acts more aggressively as Otsu's drama NHK, "Musashi." <br /> I would highly recommend film if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I adoringly am) and / or a "girl and armor" fan and it keeps up to repeat watching. For me, there is something eminent and inexplicable to appeal to "girl and gun" movies such as "La Femme Nikita" and "Goodnight in Kiss Kiss." And have a gorgeous gal like Ryoko starting to read as well as just gobs of icing on the cake.
