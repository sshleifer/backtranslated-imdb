I thought it was one of the best sequences I had seen in a while. Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die, Stanley's death of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a good movie that you were happy when so and so died. My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home cameras being filming it and being odd. Judd Nelson is nice, at least in my opinion and was excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
