Domino is a great movie. She is about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom and her shape. He met two fellow hunter (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and adventures are beginning. Script is good. Very down-to-earth with realistic and tone of the movie. The only problem I've had with this movie is that it focuses on different things that they do, instead of the character of Domino. Even so, Kiera Knightley provides a fierce performance. It shows the number of incorrect anger and dedication to this performance. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar-worthy performance in 'Sin City' and another hard-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really does not do anything except Spanish speaking each time in a short time and staring at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi provides a good performance to support. Mo'nique was himself, although he did surprise me on a particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scene with her. The best thing about the movie though, is the direction. Tony-style fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. Cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. He took a regular film and placed on acid. All the nuts are blackish, white is brighter, and has a sort of green glow on it. Scenes of action are exhilarating. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you will love Domino.
