Recap: It's business as usual at the Louche Casino in Tanger. The casino is about to close and prepare for a great transaction the next day. The owner and some staff leave for the night, leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly a troop of gangsters armed the casino storm, firing wildly. Unknown Modesty, have already been killed Lifes, and are now after the money hiding in the vault. But no one is present, and still alive, in the casino know the code to open the arch. The head itself is heavy trapped and explosive caps for the attackers can not blow the door as it was planned. Even now, Modesty finds out for eye and leader Miklos leaders in a game of casino and their lives in danger. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a written review that has no connection that forever with other media published on Modesty Blaise, as I have neither seen nor read any of it. The first point I like to do is that this is a little incredibly classified. The first time I thought this was a thriller and a bloody battle between Modesty and Miklos as the main draw. Sure, some bursts of action but are not really an integral or important part of the story. As already mentioned the main draw and the main-filled suspension scene, the game is between Modesty and Miklos. It is an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character, and in doing so much of the story taking place outside the casino in an earlier time. Someone said it is almost like a pilot for a TV set, and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such. But I felt it was a better way to introduce a character than many others did. I was in no way disappointed in lack of action, rather than I enjoyed this game, the story is more than a simple action movie. <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nicolai Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden especially shows Modesty very well, and really brings this character to trust and talent. <br /> 7/10
