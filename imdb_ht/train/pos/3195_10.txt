BEAVER TRILOGY is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was lucky enough to catch it, along with a Q & A session with director Trent Harris, at the NY NY Festival a few years ago, and bought a copy on the Trent website. This movie must be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching Trent's name on the Internet and then buy the movie from his site. She is an incredibly beautiful guy boots. Do not get confused: The cameraman in the fictional section of the BEAVER TRILOGY IS NOT TRENT! <br /> After seeing the TRILOGY a few times, I must admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version. It's like a try-out version for Glisp's Glamor Kid's Glamor section and is more exciting than a curiosity item if you're a Penn fan than it was a good video. Penn is very funny, though, and you can see the makings of a great star of this brave B & W video. This is probably one of Glisp's best crispin roles and I would just like to see a documentary update the original Groovin 'Gary. Once you see this movie, you will never find nervous laughter Gary from your head ever again.
