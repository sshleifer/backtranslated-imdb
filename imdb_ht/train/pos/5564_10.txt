The Best Cheech & Chong Movie Too Far !! Throughout the Cheech and Chong this is most certainly the best so far. I think I've seen them at least twelve times, and I love them all. But this is most definitely the best. Compared to the others, this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. Part of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope that one day they can do another, because they are always great comedians. I hear they're writing a new script so that knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who succeed in making decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever looked at one of them.
