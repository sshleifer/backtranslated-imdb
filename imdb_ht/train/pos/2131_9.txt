This is a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are many nuances performance in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a fun, brings sharp comedy relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villain" of the movie, with its oil charms well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his usual familiar use here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very credible in every facet of his role. <br /> <br /> These two driving drives are equally accomplished, and Margaret Sullivan performs an exceptional work of portraying a little desperate, neurotic, yet good and attractive woman. <br /> <This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented in his point of view, and the action rotates around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of bringing the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he's fired at his job, because of a misunderstanding. It is able to transmit the trauma, anger, fear and embarrassment that is so traumatic an event causing, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the story of the medium. There is nothing else that has ever been captured on the film that can be so completely transmitted to his feelings at a hearing. At the time he made this movie, he still has most of his career before him, but he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts's best movies, and also one of the favorite, most enjoyable romantic comedy you will find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
