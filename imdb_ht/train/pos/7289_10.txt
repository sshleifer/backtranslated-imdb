This was one of the first CREEPY cinemas ever seen ... I was about 5 at the time. She scared me good! But that night, I put the chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother was very upset. She cleans my eyes and alcohol and my next day I smell like DOUBLE MENT! Now is a movie! Hey for her when she was a big movie. This head on top of the head was as real as it came back then. And if your 5 or so it is very good! Kids now one day are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave PA for your mind's imagination. Ideas can imagine the most unusual things than special effects! (IMO)
