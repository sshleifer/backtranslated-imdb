This movie has a special way of telling the story, the first time I found it rather odd as it flown in time and I had no idea about it. Anyway, the story line was quite simple, but still very real and touchy. You met someone first time, you fell in love, but broke the last and encouraged a deadly agony. Who did not go to this? but we will never forget that kind of pain in our lives. <br /> I'd say I'm touching as two actors have shown great performance in showing the love between characters. I just hope that the story might be a happy ending.
