Unfortunately, SpaceCamp was out on the same time as the Challenger explosion. Which really puts a crimp on when it brings it out or though they should, bring it out. I'm glad they did. I first looked at SpaceCamp in a movie-driven film. Which really increases the look much. While I heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I have never heard others in the movie. So it came as a big hit to me to get all those young act, and act real good! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> I especially loved the scenes, where these kids were showing how to act, like a team. The scenes of the children being prepared for a trip could only be expected. The current launch of a spacecraft is, of course, our old news. However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my richest films. An escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a black space like me. After probably renting it for 30 - 40 times. I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.
