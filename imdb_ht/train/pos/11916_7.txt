With all the "adult" innuendos of today's family movies it's beautiful to see one where you do not have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, this movie may have some swearing words (there are times when Knox swears, but they do not let you hear the words full), but for the most part this movie is really as clean as it comes (and this including movies from back to the day). Not only that, it's very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great movie and fun to watch with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there might be more of some of the memorable parties in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any dislocated here. <br /> All in all nicely done with a great movie to watch; So go out and get the kids, do some cookies, and watch this movie!
