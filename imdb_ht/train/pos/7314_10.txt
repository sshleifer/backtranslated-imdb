The first time I saw this film, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I hope a gore farm, but instead has to look at a very clever assassin mess with myself in a gimmick band (it's actually my hub at the moment: P). The fact that I could not predict when it would kill and when it would disappear was a bigger plus in my book. Preventable horror movies made me. Now I know the scenario has some disagreements, but if you're like me, you do not even notice them until the movie is over and you're laying in bed mauling about the fact that you just witness a masterpiece of movement . Finally, as I mentioned, the band is timeless. It's one of my favorite favorite theater ever, so I was very pleased to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it intact in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very complete article about it, and, now that I know zombie zombies reveres John Carpenter, I have the high hopes of taking it on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tackle, but it's the perfect addition, box, final, or its name for an All Hallow Evaluate in marathon movie. :)
