As a Westerner watched another culture and traditions of couples, I found Just Fascinating and delightful couples. The idea of ​​getting married to a foreigner in the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. But this is the case in this Hindi movie. Tough and humorous, with fresh perspective, we learn from Abhay and Ritika who only meet once and are now on the traditional five-day bees. As said, it's hard to believe in this affluent cell phone that's like a custom reaction as a row wedding always takes place. We see the inability that this young couple feels as they come together in the first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different opinions about marriage and commitment as presented by other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years to married and others still committed marriage commitments. There's singing, sweet dialogue, poignant moments, mixed with comparisons in new ways and traditions. Watching the movie and subtitles definitely loses some of the truth in the story, yet it's still a pleasure to watch. Granting some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out with optimally; however the movie in general was worth watching.
