* some mobs <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms (acting, dating dialogue, clear scenarios) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, ominous, swearing the spirit that must touch his wings, but it is realistic to illuminate in his past life to do so. She learns too late how empty her hustling, life materialism was without love. Oral is similarly a cold man and his wife Fanny dies. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitter bit is prevented from accepting (or believing) at one. The worlds social characters represent variants colliding with the other complement, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad. <br /> <br /> The Finish Perfume is actually quite consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking around for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a feather, and he's gluttoning to it as if he finally wants to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte did not allow her to finish her miracle (either restore Fanny's health or faith to the Mostel), so she never got her wings. The float feit tauntingly from the Mostel Attatch, a metaphor for both people to live: it's too late and you do not get a second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is magic, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
