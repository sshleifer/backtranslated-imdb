This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany and their families is just great! <br /> It is not an idealistic movie, I might say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. Characters are pretty nice but there are also some "dark" places, what makes you believe that these are real people. Great movie and big actors show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can get happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
