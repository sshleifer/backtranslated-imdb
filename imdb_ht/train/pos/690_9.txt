I had no idea what this movie was about or even knew it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon when I was looking for other films that stared Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this movie was a strange insight into the mind of a leaking Traveler and what he / herself can go through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them are asleep, an exciting movie and a good part played by Dom ....... I believe that even if this movie you can not buy anywhere (well I never saw it anywhere) you must see it if you ever get The luck because it will really make you think about those people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer night after night in could not sleep or only get about 1 hour to sleep each night so overall it was a interesting films of good substance.
