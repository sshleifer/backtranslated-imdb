A movie I expect very little from, and only watch them spend a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out. Roll is an excellent if there is no-too-severe little story of 'boy-country-lost-in-great-city-do-good', it's funny at all, the characters are endearing and the march is just right. / / <br /> Toby Malone is the true star of the film and portrait of her attachment to Matt, said boy country and local Aussie Football Hero Heroes come to the big city to try out for one of the great teams. It supports superbly by John Batchelor as local local gangster. Watch out for these two. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
