I got this at the NZ plane last week, and asked how it would measure up to both the UK movie and the book. I said I was favorably impressed. If anything to the fan attachment of the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original FC Arsenal Arsenal, who has been successful in the years. As a British I was also interested to see that you do not need to understand baseball to find out what's going on. A Question of Fountains in Yourself - Will the scenario write using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (weirdly know, a British who understands baseball) I must say that he added to the fun.
