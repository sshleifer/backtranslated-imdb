Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. It was too long since you appeared in a movie, and what a movie this was, was 24, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the Secret Service Agency harassed. The character Kiefer is one of Michael Douglas's chasing film in the whole, Kiefer's partner, Eva Longoria, the Desperate Embarrassment. Wow it can actually act besides flirting all day and look good, I wish even though that Kim Bassinger was a bigger role, but other than that, I really thought the film was all an explosion from start to finish. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone has played their part in the anger. There was nothing to reveal the movie sooon, so as to keep you guess at all times. and I really think that Kiefer has done one heck in a work here in this movie, but in my opinion Michael Douglas has had the performance of many things in the day, thumb.
