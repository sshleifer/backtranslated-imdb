Kate Beckinsale is excellent as Emma's manipulative and yet irresistibly in this TV-adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read that my novel was sometimes very doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: for honestly, it is so terribly self-righteous and complaining that one is tempting flu it badly. Kate Beckinsale interpretation, however, saves Emma from her head to speak: she is portraying with the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one can help but give in with love (not to say love) her in spite in less skillful manner. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not just the reason why this set of TVs is so fun; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing this person's wisdom to the character of all (which is all the more obvious because of this role that is not very well handled by Ewan McGregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of Emma), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton, and Olivia Williams all should be in their respective roles. This production is, in short, a great success with one to see many times with increasing pleasure.
