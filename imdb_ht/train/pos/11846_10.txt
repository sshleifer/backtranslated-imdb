I loved this movie very much. The animation was well done and the romance was beautiful. I liked most of Bryan Adams's songs and Hans Zimmer's notes were excellent. What a lot of people do not realize is how it relates to the heart of darkness / Apocalypse Now theme (what's happening when so-called "civilization" invades someone elses home, what it means to be "civilized" etc.). The opening scenery and music were very stir. The movie is a plain in America that was once beautiful.
