But it's kinda hilarious, at least if you've grown up on Weird Al, like I did. It's a mockumentary about his life and career, starting with superstardom and going back to draw their origins. It's uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when it comes to Japan. Although it is not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation, and does not find love however spray, it takes in a bizarre absolutely bizarre cultural mix that is Tokyo street life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Weird Al is not recognized as commentator of cultural perspicaces that it is; Maybe a rose by any other name would smell even sweet. Still, this is a funny movie.
