Someone mastered the difficult task of merging sports and romance. In fact, sports and romance go along like oil and water. So successfully put the two sets on the screen ... well, that's about the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought he could do. I'll be the first to say that in general I do not like romantic comedy ... but I do like sports and most movies about sports. This movie was a very good mix of the two. Being a baseball fan, I could really appreciate the comedy hustle and Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) being a fan of Boston Redsox fans. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the babe that plagued the Redsox for 86 years, and they know just how black on baseball a lot of Redsox fans. Farrely's brothers did a great job of capturing that and did for good comedy. This was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
