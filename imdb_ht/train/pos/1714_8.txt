Watching my movie was in very light atmosphere and also this movie is light, but the end of the film is just unexpected that leaves a long lasting souvenir in one's mind. <br /> <br /> movie begins with Abhay and her profession for being witnessed during marriage registrar. Soha comes for her marriage and her boyfriend, leaving Soha alone on the street she can not return home and she has no thing to live on here in this situation Abahy turns out to be an assistant for her, is the basis of history. <br /> <br /> The rest is just look and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay has to face that keeps you in the corner of the chair. <br /> <br /> Dialogue with music is good song is good direction and so as the scenario you feel that film is slow, but looking at the demand in its history is indeed good. <br /> A truly specially guarded with light mood I enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
