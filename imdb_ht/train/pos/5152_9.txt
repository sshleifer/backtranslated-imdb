"Hitler, the Increase of Evil" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of World War 2. Which makes it look a refreshing experience. <br /> I think its greatest value lies in clear crystal revealing the Nazi-mechanism. In Hitler's totally cowardly way used to make it to the top. Having arrived there, this movie ends. <br /> <br /> When on top, 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') has brought Germany to the largest and most devastating war in history of mankind. Finished six years later in Germany's utter defeat. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (about 35% of its pre-war), and was forced to accept a 44-year-old occupying territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from the draft, the serious reputation damaged by many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. As I said, "Hitler, the Evil Rise" has a good look. Include in an environment-acceptable environment, and (more) competent acting. In particular Peter O'Toole's role as president of the Hindenburg age stands out, even adding an extra dimension. My copy of "Hitler, the Evil Rise" also provides a second DVD and two good movie documentaries. One is Hitler's personality, the second deals with the forgery of the Hitler-written writing. In 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.
