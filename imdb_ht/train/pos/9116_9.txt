The idea is a very clever movie title in having a serious tongue in a blow feel it. But it is so subtle you do not know how it reads! Will these guys make a full blown comedy or have something else to go on. The little movie's dialogue is not very delicate and adds to the power of the movie. If all the sound has changed off from the movie it actually would not take anything away from the movie. The physical actions or the art show is so strong that it on its own brings the whole story. <br /> I am a blessing and the blessing is the emotions that followed by shame. I first said this movie as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie I was so impressed by the work. But then I ask myself what's next? Where can another person see this work? The common association of art without aim is not to be found here. You can see the intent of the design from the start to the finish. The African musical style of the cast of everything is planned and for a reason. The character development is amazing. The casting I think is the most aspect of the movie; The characters are easily defined within 2 minutes within 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these types of films, there really needs to be major support for the development of short films across the board.
