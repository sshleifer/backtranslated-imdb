"FULL HOUSE," in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I'm not sure if I have never seen every episode but I still enjoy it. One of my favorite episodes is where John (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) are married. If you want to know how that made it so funny, you should have seen it for yourself. It was a two-party, so you'd have seen both parties. Another of my favorite episodes is where Diana, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) get close to a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You would also see it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. I have many others that I love, too. Everybody always gives a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was still very strong. In conclusion, even if it can be seen in syndication now, I recommend you catch it just in case it goes into the air for good.
