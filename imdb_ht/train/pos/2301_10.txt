Really ... with incredible films that though not very popular ... very touching and almost changing lives ... was for me at least. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my favorite movie list .... it's a current number .... <br /> <br /> is a very touching movie that everyone should see .. The Man of the Moon ..... we'll read it's just incredible. It's now my favorite movie and I only see it today and I would recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you are a bit mature ...... If you are not really try to feel the emotional characters then you will never get the true meaning and value of this movie .... But it really is incredible .... just watch it because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing 5/5
