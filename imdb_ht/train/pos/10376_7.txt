I just looked to Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. Toby Malone's performance really stands out, I find myself actually caring about what's happening Matt during the whole of the movie, which itself is a lot of fun, very positive and a good mix of well-rounded characters, quite a success consider it's running short. There are many good twists on all as well, it will keep you guessing to the end. Other characters look out for the Tally is totally crazy and sneaking to attract Isaiah. It may not have the big budget a Hollywood blockbuster but do not let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
