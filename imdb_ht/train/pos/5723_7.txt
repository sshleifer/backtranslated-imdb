So, being a deep fan of horror movie movies, it's been a while since I saw one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously.) <br /> definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out ... a hell of a lot better than the ring. The thing that I do not get is that many people that we talked about after the movie thought it was awful, well, if that's what you think, then so it ... i know what i love and it takes a just the amount of money I actually get scared, so I have to say that this one is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now, you might be ashamed of the story if you need everything in a clean and clean line, because the plot goes back a little help to build the story (I think if it's showed in chronological order, it would have lost all the stuff.) <br /> I'm actually happy that this movie was very little bloody in blood ... it can be the rest of your studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that You do not have to splash the red thing all over the frightening series.
