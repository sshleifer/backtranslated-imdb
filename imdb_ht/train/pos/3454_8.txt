First, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed and make her look good, in fact I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I made this movie. <br /> I worked in a store video and when I saw this movie and dropping its big that I had never even heard of I saw what it was about. I did not get Justin to act that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a very impressive group, and Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that did not even make the first credit list. The story is basic, a journalist discovered corrupt cops, but I found it well done. Character L L Cool J was clearly controversial, but I honestly did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise counselor figure does so well, and as much as I love Kevin Spacey, it's kind of just. HI character did not have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, it can not do any harm. Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott had given the best performance as a homicide cop. Surely credible and really of character, he leaned me out a couple of times. I really expect a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible chore, unjustified action sections, things like that, but it was amazingly well done and I did not find any of that. Each shot was a point, it was not clich√©d, very solid. <br /> <br /> In general, amazing cast, decent history that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I do not know why he did not appear in the theater, it was better than some garbage I saw on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.
