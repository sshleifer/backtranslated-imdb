Morgan Freeman and Pegas Vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go on doing the commission according to the need of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is superbly human, with respect to one and all, while Pegas Vega is the orgy checker behind the "10 items or less" check out lines, intimidation customers and bored out of his mind. Together they explore, discover, and learn each other. To do this in course must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor, of those both having. I wish this movie was realistic, I wish this kind of story that happened more often, I wish we did not have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even though we come from vast origins different. The film is based on the heart open and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other out there - a world where peace could be a possibility.
