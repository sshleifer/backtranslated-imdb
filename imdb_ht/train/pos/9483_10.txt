This is a must see for anyone who likes suspense especially political gossip. A scene that stands out is Milgram's experience shot at perfection very rarely we get to see a movie shot and scripted that way this movie presents. The movie begins with a Kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the murder. However, one of the members does not agree with the final outcome of the committee. As each requirement puts an end to a single investigation into the murder. This inquiry gets him involved in deep secrecy and darkness in high office politics and how they are controlled.
