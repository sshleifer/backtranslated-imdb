Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades west it comes across like Real McCoy, refreshing, entertaining, spectacular; in a way that outdated. As a real fan of DEADWOOD the TV, I'll tell you the performance of Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are far on-target. /> <br /> We have no gall in Hollywood anymore. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classic from the 1936-1945 decades that saw commercial decades after decades: release, re-give, re-give all over again. Creators like Spielberg today, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's cinema will be sought from 7 months left alone 70 years.
