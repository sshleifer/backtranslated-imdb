This movie is forbidden in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) Which stars in this were really desperate for a job, or we just friends. Here's the effect: <br /> Three thugs of the evil turtle from a woman discourages them, using all sorts of things to eventually kill him, burn him, kick him, turn here around to a Chairs (more than 200 times!), use sound turtles (do not force it to listen to a static sound for more than 20 hours! It does not sound bad at all, but it can make you go dark). Throw bowel (probably from an animal) into it while shes knock out, and lean when he wakes up. And who can forget the final grandest ETABALL TORTURE biggest I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a simulator movie maker, you'll think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This guarantees freak people out and make some sick! As I said most underground. Check it if you are a fan of terible underground, or alien gore. If not I highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! From the gorilla, shock, and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but in the storyline and all this it is a 1. A classic underground ... My final rating is an 8/10 < br />
