when you add all the aspects from the movie --- dance, sing, act --- the only one that stands out the best of the cast is Vanessa Williams ... its dedication, energy and timeless beauty do Rosie the perfect role for her. Never have I ever seen someone showing Rose and these vibrant! Vanessa's talented singing shows beautifully and all the songs she does as Rose and her acting act never cease to amaze me! His dance is so incredible, though as some people say the choreography was bad - his dance skills were better than before! I would recommend this version of the '63 just because I find that although the long act by Vanessa is superb ----- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well (with the exception Chynna Philips ... what's hell was thinking of being cast?) Everyone in all I would say this version is wonderful and I recommend that everyone sees this version!
