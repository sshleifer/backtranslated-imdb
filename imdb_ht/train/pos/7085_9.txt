I just bought the DVD and I must say, (after seeing Brazil and fearing a bad one in Las Vegas) Terry did it again. As well as being a fan of the Monty Python films, Terry Gilliam's genius follows in this thriller girl, which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and as well (maybe my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the frenzy of Jefferey Goines. A must have for fans, or movie fans of any kind, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> any way to draw, in the future, 1% of the world's population survived a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by "the army of dozen monkeys". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in time can get a healing. Before I go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world over the surface due to the disease that will kill them. anyway when it was sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of being told to the virus. While remaining, he meets Jeffersy Goins (Brad Pitt) who later is mainly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe) who eventually teamed up with Bruce to save the world (as he sees it correct in his sayings), has sent back and forth from his time in the past and eventually sent in 1996 He then questioned his own sanity, but later pulled in revealing an endless trim in the movie and later built up to the shocking climax, where he tried to stop the man carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and is rather injected by the police as the killer gets away.
