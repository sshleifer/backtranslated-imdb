Henry Fonda brilliantly captured what we have ever believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It's a fool. Through Fonda's performance we will lead to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a land bumpkin. But in his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court procedure, you can see that under the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film Henry Fonda shows that she has a very good threat in how to present humor. It is an aspect of it that has been lost over the years. When it tells stories and jokes it has the timing down to perfect. There is a sequence of lawsuit that I laughed quite hard. It shows this gift again in the Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The finish by John Ford is absolutely brilliant and Henry Fonda goes to the top of a hill and within a great symbolic storm of civil war la. He goes ahead in history. The movie is fiction, but the insight of Lincoln is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.
