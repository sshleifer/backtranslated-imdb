MARYAIRE MISSOURI arrives in New York City who knows exactly what he wants: for a solid one to marry a millionaire - without losing her girls. With his knockout it seems to quickly capture the eye of the playboy sound of a tycoon, but does not remain true virtue will it also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. With her platinum hair & gorgeous gown, she is a dazzler. But her beauty should not be dark to the fact that she was also a very good actress. He just earned his place at the very top of the Hollywood panthe. An excellent cast to Harlow fine support: Lionel Barrymore as the old familiar, wise wise tycoon of Harlow's way; Beautiful Franchot Tone as her son, striking with love; Particularly Patsy Kelly, steals her scene as Harlow's sidekick; deboller Alan Mowbray, as a well-Englishman; elderly Clara Blandick as barrymore's secretary secretary; Hale Hamilton's feelings as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; Muscle Pendleton Muscle as a lifeguard that captures Kelly's Flirtatious eyes; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankruptcy businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced right after the Hollywood Production Code was instituted. A comparison with RED-HEADED REDUCTION, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - Harlow's character goes after the same, but uses very different meanings.
