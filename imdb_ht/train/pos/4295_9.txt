Alain Chabat claims this film as her original idea, but the theme of esteeming lovers who finally finds it together is as old, if not older, than Shakespeare. Chabat is a "good gan", seamlessly one and does not want any member of the opposite sex to disrupt his lifestyle. He has a problem, 5 sister and a matriarchal mum - the G7 - who decides he should be married. Join the delightful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte was posed as Chabat's girlfriend and then simply did not turn up on the day of the wedding. No more talk about marriage in the G7. Of course the best plans to put have a habit of spiraling out of control. <br /> There are very strong roles supported from Lafont as Mom and Osterman as the tight-fisted brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <Some fantastic scenes as Charlotte first has charm, then family riot. French French with an English.
