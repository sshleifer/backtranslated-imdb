"Slaughter High" is, perhaps, the most mechanical sticker in the 1980s. It is one of the few films in the genre that enthralling at all. That being said, it also depends on the standard slasher formula: A group of young men and women killed one by one grueomely until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" stands above the most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a bad against his former classmates. They electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room, jabbed at his side with a spear, and, at his head, rigged his experimental lab studies so he could disguise him. So the victims of this movie are about as unlikeable as you find. When assembled later years - at a high school reunion set by Marty himself - you realize they were not mature enough. They are a lot of sociopaths. <br /> It is mind-boggling why they would not ask why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion, which, by the way, occurred in a school that had fallen since disrepair. And who would think it is advisable to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers - as well as Marty's - on display? There are many leaps of faith the visitor needs to enjoy this movie. The finish does little or no sense. And the screen has a strange understanding of how April's working days are working: the film claims that the towers do not allow after noon. <br /> In all, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It is difficult to understand why it has not yet found its way into DVD, when many other run-of-the-mill slasher flashlights are grab and special editions.
