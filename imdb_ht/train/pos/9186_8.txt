Troubled magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has terrible nightmare in which he brutally kills his model. When the beautiful ladies start turning dead for real, Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman relates the rugged story at a steady pace, building a reasonable amount of tension, delivering a few moments of gruesomely effective violence violent violence (one woman with a plastic bag bags and a rattlesnake in her wearing self percentage as defining the extreme-indirect highlight), putting a refreshing emphasis on the characters nicely drawn and engaged true-to-life, more yard everything in a possible everyday world, and top things off with a good smattering in tasty nudity women. The fine acts from an excellent cast to help a whole lot: Joanna Pettet as the sun, good love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as concerned Adrien's psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's fascist gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as detective detective Sergei Sous detective, Cleavon Little as a hard-nosed police officer, and Misty Rowe as sweet, modern bambi pattern. R. Polar Cinema Michael R. Michael Stringer makes the occasional impressive use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga is threatening to score that also makes the trick. Popping up in cool bit parts is Robert Tessier as a gray barman, Sally Kirkland as a hooker saucy, Kathy Shower as a violent wrestler B.J. grapples and the ring, and Frances Bay in one of the role women's role in women. A solid and enjoyable picture.
