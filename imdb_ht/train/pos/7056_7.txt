The end of the ever-popular Cinderella story reminds me of a bit of what they did with one of the Beauty & the Animal Movies. It's fundamentally three stories rolling in 1. <br /> OK, the adorable mice (I love Gus! It's nice sooo!), And Lucifer's roundabout (as usual). I liked some of the newer characters as well, (Pom Pom was adorable and I did like Prudence.) Still, the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very nice. So I vote 7/10.
