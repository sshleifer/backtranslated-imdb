I give it only 9 out of 10, because I need to see it again, in an actual frame frame-has a cool perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological comic that dazzles my brain and my eyes when I look at it. I would watch it every time he came on HBO back in the day (probably 1990 or so). I could even record it, but that recording is time gone, I'm sure. <br /> I write GreenCine to try and get this title in, they are now not carrying it. I hope I can find it in a local video store. <br /> I would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere. It's interesting at least at many. If you enjoyed movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or any sort of weird and along the lines, try this one out.
