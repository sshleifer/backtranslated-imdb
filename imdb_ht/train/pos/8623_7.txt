THE TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - but still is an interesting movie to deal with suicide and purpose and division. Those looking for a gore-fest, or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DE TODESKING is definitely a "art-house" style movie, so those who need linear, the narratives explain no need to apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER THINGS is that there is an "episode" for every day of the week that revolves around a string of strange string that apparently causes people to commit suicide, interspersed with the scene of a slowly decomposed scene. There are some very well done and think provocative scenes, including the man talking about "The problems" with his wife, and the massacre of concerts (which unfortunately lost some of it's "power" on me, because I was too busy laughing at SCORPIONS look-alike on stage ...). But seriously - this is sometimes nice (the scene shows different angles of this bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene, and that the names shown are those who actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes unusual (SHE WOLF in the SS rip-off is very fun), sometimes harrowing (I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park on his wife particularly efficient) film that is more of an "experience" then just entertainment, as many of these films "art" mean to be. Still, I did not get DER TODESKING to be strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and would probably put it on relatively same pace with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of personally "my level of fun". Definitely worth a look at any Buttgereit fanatic or "art". If you dig this type of film - check out the intricacies of CRUELTY - in my opinion the best art-movie / movie movie I've seen. 7/10 FOR THE TODESKING
