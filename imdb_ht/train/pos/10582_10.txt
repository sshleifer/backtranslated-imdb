He sang. He had dramas. He had comedy. He had a story. It is one of the greatest movies ever made ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie, then you must either sleep or in some kind of mental disorders. In the "Dancer Dandy Dandy" James Cagney singing and dancing his way to an Academy Award; but in this movie it is best! This is James Cagney in his best wishes! It's fast with one-the-hardware! He's fast with his feet! It's ongoing action. And the singing-and-dance skittles are classic, especially "Shanghai Lil." And the support is great; and the movie is all optimistic, fast moving, and reluctant to trust. And even though this film was about 70 years ago, it's still lookable, even today. And of course, this movie features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you love optimism, fast paced movies, and lots of songs and dances, this is the movie to watch.
