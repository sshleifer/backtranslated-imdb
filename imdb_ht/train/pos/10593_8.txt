My TV cable has been called what is called the Art Canal, which is a "catch-as-catch-case" situation sometimes, sometimes film, sometimes short clips of movie or ballet, and I've come to this same as the scene Bar came on, where they tore the coupons. Excellent, exquisite, Ealing wins again, hail-Glasgow-raised I would like this, I should never get a copy of it. Some of Britain's best artists, from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and Miss Rutherford's delicious, had a wonderful time gently sticking to the Home Office. Loved the last stage, where as soon as they "returned to England!" the temperature is plummets and it rains.
