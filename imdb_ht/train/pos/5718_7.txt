I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought first ticket and then checked the comments of IMDb. I'm worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I've had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scared, were actually quite humanitarian, almost like in the Buffy Vampire Slayer. <br /> I do not consider this a bad movie. It's not a big movie either. Just a rather well done horror movie. It does not depend much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the act was OK. Sarah did a good job, quite compelling. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I loved Yoko. Together they are nice (and I do not care that these sets are the same ones that are used in the original Japanese). <br /> <br /> The fear moments were often predictable. But not always. I've seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be afraid now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. The movie has some pretty scenes that were almost original, such as the trails of garbage, the simple special effects for her ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cats that made noises Eeryo, gurgling of the boy dies with his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because she is very different from her buffy work, more seriously. Do not go if you only want to see movies that pick up Oscar nomination. It's a good horror film, enough suspense. I gave it a 7.
