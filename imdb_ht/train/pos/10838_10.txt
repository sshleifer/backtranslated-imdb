I agree with what "vennbreaker" wrote and considered "Ahhhh" feel you get to the end of this movie. I absolutely love where they chose films, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic track sounding on which Hans Matheson sing. It trippy. Nighy was fab in his role, Nail's "nail", Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea kept him together. Bruce Robinson was scared. Helena was a beautiful girlfriend. But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was gorgeous. The scene between Aubrey & Robinson killed me! Perfectly played with the music behind the scenes was spot on! Too bad by many more musicians have checked this movie out! They should! I told my friends all my friends. Big quote by Jimmy Nail's character: "It's supposed to be rock & roll, not the Phantom in the f * g operation!"
