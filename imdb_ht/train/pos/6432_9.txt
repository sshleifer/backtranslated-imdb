Thanks to a clever script with a fixed hand in Writer / Director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a funny and very likable mystery comedy. The movie starts methodically and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are terrific as they team up to unravel the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, from the movie "Thin Man". Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alexman McArthur's wife has suffered from the role of the characters, played by veteran actor Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris to make well and provide many light moments in just the right time. There's even a comma by Rex Linn. In all, I felt like I read a good book of the fire.
