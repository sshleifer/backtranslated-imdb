Jimmy Cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage producer-who are vigorously struggling against the "talking" movies. <br /> This story of love, lies, women and dance presented in such a way that a viewer you never treats at a dull moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. The story never really lost in this frantic pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become a small date, but that does not matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time frame it is fabulous to look this next to a lot of the other drags into movies that were released during that time. Jimmy Cagney is an eye for the eye of this movie, never releasing her comedy as the ever-working producer of forecasts made for the movie theater as intros. In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business, he was a Broadway producer before he started this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as careless-loving, in, giving such a brave performance that is so unusual for movies at that time, so fresh look of a woman described as a strong woman for a change. <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the enormous outputs of the end. These were magnificent in itself, very good choreography and beautiful products, but they just did not seem to fit into the story. The only link they have in the main story is that Cagney has put on 3 forecasts in 3 days to get a deal and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls were rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit into a movie theater. In this way "sitting on a yard fence" was much more appropriate in the story. <br /> <br /> Their output at the end seemed to drag this story frantically rhythm to a halt and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first sequence music and then I realized there was another two coming. These sequences received a lot of chuckles from the audience as well. <br /> All in all a great movie with a sequel ending.
