Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such are embarrassing and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it's full of preggo killings and abortion fails. Brooke Adams star as Virginia. She and her square in a husband go to some fancy fancy clinics because they can not have kids on their own. There are Dr. Meyerling (James Karen in ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling has had a very high success rate of getting married couples. (Put the joke here.) Is it because it created some baby genetic supermutant bloodthirsty? That's what Virginia begins to think when it starts having some odd and extreme side effects from the treatment. That's when he starts to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> On this one, you'll have to find the rest of the details elsewhere because if I told you all the goodies this one was you could hurt yourself to put it in. on your Netflix queue too fast. It's a bit slowing-moving for a while, but once it's pick up in the final third, all the systems are gone! Very highly recommended by me about the forces of its un-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 from seventeen stars.
