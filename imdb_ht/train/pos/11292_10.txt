I saw this movie once like a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with her. <br /> It took 30+ years, but I recently found it on DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a catalog that specializes in movie wars. We watched it last night for the first time. The audio was good, but it gotten down and the trailers were between coils. Even so, it was better than I remembered it. I was also impressed by how true she was playing. <br /> <br /> The catalog is around here somewhere. If you are sincere in finding it, fire me a message and I'll see if I can get you the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
