Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary on rookie New York City firefighters. What they got was the movie film only inside the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> Having worked with James Hanlon's ladder before, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gideon stayed in the fire of the bridge in any interesting case that happened. An airplane that flew over the City was distracted by Jules, and it showed the camera, the previous one of the aircraft crashed into Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him at the towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused film. It remains on site for the next few hours, meeting of firefighters and others there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet Brothers have taken care of not making the movie too violent, grizzly, and gory. But the language from the firefighters is a little coarse, and CBS showed a lot of balls to launch it uncensored. The Naudet brothers blend their footsteps and one-on-one interviews for firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during the particular moment of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film in similar titles, most of the money from DVD sales goes through 9/11 related to charities. Very well done, emotional, moving, and completely devoid of political propaganda, is the best documentary of the sort dating.
