... I saw this on cable back in late 1980 as I was a big fan of struggle since 1986. I saw this on VHS in a 'for sale' bin and buy it. In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after air force and would always go back in this view to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people involved in struggles (family and friends who would not understand us, trips the anguish, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to look as nobody else can understand what a genius it is creativity. A great way to separate himself from the Fonz character he played on happy days at the time. Plus, look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and writer Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance, look at it.
