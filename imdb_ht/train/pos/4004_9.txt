'Mother' is that extraordinary piece of film - it gets you thinking, it pulls no punches - and finally it leaves you thinking. Very open-ended as the lead character's fate. Anne Reid (which I only knew shortly at his appearances in some Victoria Wood-led projects and thought a fine comedy) is truly superb here. No married wife widow was perfect at marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that is free-dynamic and adventurous first. She plays her character just with the right note that true ring (well, she did me). Powerful throw. Great script. Renaissance in European movies indeed;)
