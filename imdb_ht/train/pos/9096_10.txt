Adorable! I saw Domestic import of Philly in October with my kids. We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that in years! It was the first time that I could remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy. It's really nice and we can not wait to read it out on DVD. They need to make more movies like Domestic Import. It is worthwhile to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not embarrassed). I have not seen a movie this beautiful since my great Greek wedding. I liked Sterling Minding as Mom. He was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is in this also and is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
