This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Each performance of this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE movie career if this is anything to go through. I thought Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated with big budget wothbusters (Jumanji, my honey shrunk kids). It pulls in every stage and absolute class. My favorite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston would be directing more of these brilliant films, acting as well as great budget blockade budgets, which is also excellent. KUDOS !! of all involved in this masterpiece!
