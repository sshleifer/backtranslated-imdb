See both parts twice. Enjoy the story and enjoy seeing a great Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very credible as Alan Quartermaine's Hunter and certainly the best performances of Richard Chamberlain. I admit that I'd rather see someone else as the "Lady of Distress". Alison Doody should stick to modern fashion and not period. He did not have to look at the woman in the 1800s. The rest of the cast was terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I'm glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable, but not to hide in it. A man of 50+ can be very sexier (and, Patrick really is sexy) then a young green, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for the character lines go along with a big smile.
