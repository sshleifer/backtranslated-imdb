Not everything was said in this excellent first feature from CÃ©line Sciamma. The friendship, "wanting to fit in", the first sexual feelings ... All this and more is sublime in the scenic swim underwater sinchro. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It is a much less vulnerable approach to understanding the teens year compared to, says, "Thirteen", but a very refreshing journey however. A must see, and please leave all American movie preconceptions in her door. The soundtrack is A + by the way. <br /> Good cinema!
