Dana Andrews stands "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950 movie that also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a cop and a bad temper that came to trouble in the past to beat suspects. When someone is murdered in a club game owned by a mobster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scalise blame the murder on Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but the victim. Dixon thought the victim had a lot of money and died as a result of the mobster. She went to see Paine and, not realizing she had a plate in her head of the war, hit him on the floor and inadvertently killed her. Now he must cover up the murder. As a further complication, it falls to Morgan; Her father (Ken Tully), who went to the paine apartment after seeing that Paine hit her daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> This is a really terrific, fearless noir and some good performances. Andres are very beautiful and convinced weather as a hard yet nervous detective that has to remain one step ahead of his colleagues. The film assembles her with fabulous "Laura" coaster, Gene Tierney, and looks beautiful as a pattern of bad taste in men who apparently used to have been stirring up. Little she knows, she got another on her hand. Ken Tully does a terrific job as his father, who protested his innocence despite some overwhelming evidence. Karl Malden is very difficult as Dixon boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving film and absorbed is the finish. Most Hollywood and, putting myself in place of Tierney, I doubt I would react similarly. A minor critic for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as awe-inspiring as "Laura," but some things in this world. If you love noir movie, this is a must-see.
