As if the film was not in the value itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the movie in NYC; which fell to graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the fun of reading the novel was my memory of the movie scrupulously detailed. And for better or worse - and I have now read and taught the novel for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
