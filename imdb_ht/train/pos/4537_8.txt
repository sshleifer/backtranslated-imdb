I saw the movie for the first time in the BBC in July 27 of 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of Conan Doyle's people, and I really wonder what the sherlock fans think about it. I think it's a movie for these fans if they agree or not that mentioned. You may ask yourself that A.C. Doyle a strong person or has put himself in question. However he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how many of it was a sort of semi-biography? Not least, I strongly put this adaptation forward, it's a movie you must see - even if you are not interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look at it, enjoy yourself and have your own opinion in it .
