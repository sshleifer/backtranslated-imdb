There are garbage on the cable movie channels that I hit a gem with this one. From the start to the end I was gripped and deserved to mark. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons heard the message from "God" to kill those he said are 'demon'. When the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning about a bad movie; Exceptionally it is the back here as the drama is that does not stop from the beginning to end. <br /> And there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there is no unnecessary or needless sub- to cemetery, and the script is first-class. <br /> <br /> All actors fully perform persuasive to the exceptionally exceptional lead actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as the love of 'the Lamb's Silence.'
