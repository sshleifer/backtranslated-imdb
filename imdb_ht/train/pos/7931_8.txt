Man, if anyone is expecting a big zombie movie after reading this title, then you are a delay and you deserve to be ashamed. As for myself, I was hoping a low-budget cheeseball low-budget zombie and that's exactly what I got. I was not ashamed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. Zombies were exactly as they should, because all the zombies were only being turned, so they are fresh-underdog zombies. Obviously they did so because it would have been very costly if they were doing full-on rotten zombie FX. I understand everything, I have no idea how one could seriously hit this movie. It's called "HOOD OF LIFE" for God's love! Would you watch "Redneck Eyeshadow" and any Uwe Boll movie and actually expect it to be great? Of course not! So why some morons on IMBb whining like girls school on this movie, I will never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies out there, so stop telling that this was the worst you've ever seen, causing you to know you are full of it! Have you ever seen "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? These are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you can not see that it's just a low-budget zombie film obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Tumbs up in my hand and I would also like to see an end.
