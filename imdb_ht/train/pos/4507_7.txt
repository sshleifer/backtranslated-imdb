I've really stunned how much a movie, which's over 60 years old could impress me. It's almost two hours, there is absolutely no star in it, there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and interesting to watch. What impressed me mostly was realism in the movie. You could almost feel frost in the mirror, because you could see the real storms. This is a relief of a world-like CGI like our days. I asked how much this work was for windy dikes. I read somewhere that she took her 17-month movie. Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' again? It's a great movie with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how big and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects.
