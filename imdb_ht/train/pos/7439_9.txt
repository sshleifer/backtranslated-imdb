The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as the original poem was / is. The context / environment with the old sailor itself is fine, clear, and without pretense. Artwork accompanying the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time / environment setting and the work itself, brings the audience of the period with a still, continued accompaniment, using excellent yet-movement strategy only well conquered by pre-MTV producer era and much less apparent in more current work. (MTV has led to television and video of a static movement that races, often cut off petrol, from term terms without moving forward and without clear clarity of theme or scenario.) The voice, intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading bring this The poem touches in life with its fears, tales and pains. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the occasional and monotonous cadastral (in this case a positive attitude under the theme of the story itself) to pronounce the author of Sad and Spooky's former story. This is a must for any love of classic poetry, the sea, a tall tale, which is almost true ring, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A really fine experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilva to bring this into life for us, never to be forgotten.
