This story is impossible in a female witch pursuing a mortal man, in a mortal world. His "community" is open among his members, but he hides his magic from mortals. Hmmmm ... this is starting to sound familiar. LOL. It's not your typical film. Very "firm" performance by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs to keep things from getting dull. Kim Novak is still a fun on screen, but I found him getting married to James Stewart weird (but not fatal in the story). With re-engaging interest in all these witchy and black things, this movie deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences ...... it's still a HOOT!
