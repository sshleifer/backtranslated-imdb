Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: the worst murder, rally of clues, gaggling of possible perplexing, sprinkling of red heres, and inevitable confrontation between cleverly clever and even more intelligent criminals. <br /> <br /> "Forget" abandon the trumpet of assets and gives us complex characters that can or can not commit terrible acts. The fact that by the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied packages can frustrate some, but for me it was the clue of a cleverly fabricated story that probes, disturbs, and cascades with the question: What what does a wrong person look like? <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and combining production make a mystery is not easy ... forget.
