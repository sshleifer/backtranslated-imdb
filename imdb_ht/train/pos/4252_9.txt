This movie takes you inside itself in the early minutes and keeps you in the end. It has a very human story and lots of good music choices. Acting in Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfied. Recommended to those who get bored in action movie and want to see a good movie.
