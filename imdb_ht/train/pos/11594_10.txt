I just found the IMDb and searched this movie and I moved almost into tears by the comments of everyone who saw this movie as I did when 6 or so year old in 1967? I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year. I burst into the movie cinema when the boy returned to the Eagle and always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home we had a cooked dinner dinner and I got the right bone and guess which I wanted to do? My father then said 'I bet you wanted to be an Eagle' and of course we all know that their will broke if someone guess so tears more and a little resentment that day could not be able fly away ...
