Emma is a true romance. If you like soppy things, packed with wit and crap, you will love this movie! True to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my easy actreesess but it does justice to a role that requires everything he has to offer in shades. It shines in a role I think that no other actress could do good justice. <br /> Jeremy Northam, as the hero. how are you shocked? I never looked at her as openly handsome but hey! What is the right role can do for you! It looks so nice as the tender, regular gentleman K, that I even look at him in a new light. It does with excellent romantic lead. The charm and character it brings in its role is wonderful! <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a good cast. A good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. It enhances the extraordinary height film
