This movie is a remake of two movies that was a lot better. The last, the sky can wait, was great, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock begins to show some of the fun fun that got him to where it is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays as some movie really "B" movie where people sound like them in some bad TV-sitting. Situations are forced and are like they just trying to get the story about that they can start the real movie. It all looks like real fake and the correction is just bad. I do not know how to release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see it then.
