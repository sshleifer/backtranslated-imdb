"Heartland" is a wonderful treasure of what she really loves to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the difficulties in the climate and lack of medical care are entrusted with the comradeship and colonial interdependence. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose children are still there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was celebrity or look as though they had just spent a session with the makeup department or costume. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. It is an example of strong, enduring individuals who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and did not let any difficulties stand in their way into a new life into a new country.
