"Pecker" is a young, unnamed photographer from Baltimore who gets a big star to the public, the media and scene of local art and his photos showing the dirty reality of all day life just as pesky or extreme panties someone. It is a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore based on independent comedies to show the unusual places in the American way of life between political fashion correctly and conservative backlash by exploring the origins of the middle class society of his country. Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" plays Pecker fame, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and long actress Dino Mink was stolen. Although the rhythm of the plot has become a major defect sometimes and can not compete with the quick joke and anger of the brilliant "Mother Series", it's still a good laugh at it and some unforgettable scenes like a small antique girl who has become a vegetarian by sniff bean from a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about delusion in the art scene, media hypes, sexually explicit middle class and the weird ways of how to become a pop star without it. Recommended!
