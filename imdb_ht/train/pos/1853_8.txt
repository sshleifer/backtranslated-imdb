Well, it's still a movie that plays with your feelings and you come out as soft as opposed to a Rocky movie. But I'm a sucker for people so I gave him a good score ... The act was very good and had a lot of feelings. Violence is kept at a minimum that makes a change. I would give it a 9 if he did not salute the end! All in all a good movie with pretty good actors. <br /> <br />
