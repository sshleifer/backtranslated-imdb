A Columbo notch head from beginning to end. I particularly love the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. As a hungry Columbo fan, I can not remember another person in which he does not set up the killer in the end as he does in other episodes. In this one, as he tried to determine the correct sequence in the boxes with the "message" that the nephew left behind, he finally dawns about it. <br /> <br /> The music of this episode is very good as well, as it is in many of the other.
