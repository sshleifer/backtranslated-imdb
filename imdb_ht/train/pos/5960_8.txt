It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where he smiles very much. He also liked to hear his song. Beautiful changes to see her from her CSI / West Wing / ER role. The movie itself was fun, but it seemed to skip some explanations of a lot of parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable a minute and the next happy and left up to your imagination to know why. Each character was original if and in some cases, I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie was not full of squeaky people but rather complicated realist people who can make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.
