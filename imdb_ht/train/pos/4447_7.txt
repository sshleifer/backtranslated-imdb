Barbara Stanwyck provides early Douglas Sirk-led this, Universal product that just soars the footage that she needs. Not nearly as memorable as the later melodramas of the Circus, it's easy to see by looking at "All My Desire" where Sirk should be artistic title in the years to come. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown, US.A, after being deserted a decade earlier. Her family and the community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking returns. Some of the amazing movies, and Stanwyck are hard-like-nails and really give this movie a shot of energy. In general, a fairly good show.
