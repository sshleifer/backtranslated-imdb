This is a nice piece of work. Very sexy and engaging enough to draw my interest at all. Its main disadvantage is that it looks like it's made-for-TV: Full screen, and even though there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no stripping (but boy made it come close!). Strangely, too, since Netflix shows that he has rated R. <br /> However, very titillating, and I wish Alicia Silverstone did more movies like this. <br /> One Reviewer Netflix stated that he was part of a series, but I could find out which series is. I would like to find out, though, because this movie was good. <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
