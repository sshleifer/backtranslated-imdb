This entertainment PM is laced and bullet enough to make John Woo say, "Enough already!" Of course, it's not as pretty as Woo can save but it gets the OS job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a civilian cop in the near future. When his wife is heading to kill the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it's up to Eric to clear his name. Wilson gets Van Damme's homework as she plays the heroic lead and his evil Cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car rides, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shooting outs. I particularly love the wind that bends to midair before it even comes close to touching a truck exploding. My dear little girl involved a girl in her next round of his perfect karate at Don's simulator. It is simply a chance to show off some of the early LAWNMOWER MAN's effects in about 1995.
