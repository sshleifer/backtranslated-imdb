I'm a big fan of the officials in Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flicker movie. I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blokbusters. <br /> It's funny audience trains against this movie and excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." Do you remember to remember the humor of the humor of the pilot episode? Daisy makes insanity jokes and Bo says that Luke was probably half-children's children in the orphanage. The only reason it was to clean is because it changes to and sooner rather place. <br /> <br /> And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect scheme dukes. In fact as a remake it probably remains the most of the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen. While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I was not too keen on the Hogg Boss Boss though. And I would like such a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a little ... scary. Who did not have a smile on the faces as the Lee Lee is racing on the streets of Atlanta and the roads back to Hazzard? / <br /> Folks, allow you to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not regret. That's just a great movie!
