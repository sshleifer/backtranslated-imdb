Classical culture is almost impossible to predict. Who Can Guess Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies that were hung by critics and audiences as they released, would become so popular? Like many IMDBERS, I consider myself a movie expert. Unlike most people who hated Envy (evidenced by a 4.4 dimensional rating), I was jealous of being one of the funniest movies in the last decade. The film's draw is ridiculous. The dialogue is not intelligent, the scenes have little continuity, and the script looks like it was written by a fourth grade. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, in order to appreciate the accident genius of jealousy, you have to enjoy the movie from a point of ironic-tear. <br /> <br /> Why do I love jealousy? Because the film is bad in point that it gets good. This is the recipe for a classic kil, and Envy definitely suits the bill.
