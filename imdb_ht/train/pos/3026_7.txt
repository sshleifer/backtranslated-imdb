Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and came to London to buy charcoal at "Confidential Agent", a 1945 film that began with Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorra, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers were stolen, accused of murder, but he was determined to get his people's coal to fight the fascism. This movie has its good point and no good. It high rates for atmosphere and suspense, and it is very fun. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou says, Lorre is slim, Hendrix is ​​remarkably pathetic, and Seymour wonderful surprise. <br /> <br /> No good points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Spanish Boyer. Uh, no. Boyer is terrific in his role and the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not in the British upper class. The two there is no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a bit bad. Acting it is not up to sniff either; it is best in other films. But it is an amazing woman to look, and many can be forgiven. Paxinou is almost overhead and lovers. Dan Seymour almost robbed the entire movie as a hotel guest who studied human nature. It's a great party and its performance is perfect, while some in the direction of other actors are not as good. This was definitely a case with no small part, only small actor. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
