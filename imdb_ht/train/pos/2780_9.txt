Great movie-I like it. Great correction and use of the belt. Giving real life to Indian life, but we all can relate. A well-chosen cast with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters so that you really care about them all and you feel like you know them. Using Indian music and drums in some of the football scene is great and the way really works as everyone comes as real and natural. You just can not help but the roots of Jess in this movie! The act was really good, even the tomboyish market and body posture of both leading ladies is very compelling as someone who has played a lot in football.
