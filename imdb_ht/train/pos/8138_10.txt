CB4 was awful, but he could give Cundieff the best idea. More like Spinach Tap anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Surprised everyone who saw him back in the middle nineties. Performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, more like brothers Marx. These guys are real and slightly diverse. They react to situations like any of us might. Well, we can not throw an anger when our performance hats are late in the gig, or pull gun and beat down a record company executives, but you get the picture. N (n *** as) W (and) H (hat) cares seriously enough to reel you at, then you're hooked. Renting or finding this at all expenses, even if you are not really in rap music, this will always let you look loud. Comparing this CB4 is like comparing the George George Star Wars 'Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
