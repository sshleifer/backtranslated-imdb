I saw this movie (its English title is "Who Sing Over There?") In the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. It was wrecked then ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It is brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad, and very funny. The script is a work of art. It was 19 years and I saw only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.
