An old saying goes "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." That has been updated in recent years of "If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those who is so bad, good! That's why I gave it a seven-by-all right, but not great. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, as the daily talk show is published as "an hour in your life you will never return!" All the familiar themes are here ... faithful men / boyfriends, the audience heated on television, women flashing Jerry, etc. The jackpot watched Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Head Herman to "play a trailer-litter mom and Jaime Pressly (" My Name is Earl ") as a trashy daughter, making sexual favors for virtually every person with whom they came in touch. The guys (including the employee's producers) were presented as thinly deserved by the excellence they received. I do not want to spoil or reveal everything, but the movie plays like the show everyday. Here in Phoenix, it shows back-to-back for two hours each morning and, after all, everything else seems to speak. Again, I give this film a seven ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best placed in small doses of one hour.
