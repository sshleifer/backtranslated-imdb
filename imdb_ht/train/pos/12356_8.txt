Unlike summing up some people, women shown in the movie are not Geisha. They are oysters (prostitutes) living outside the famous fun districts, with their lives and experiences representing their lives in a large number of Tokugawa women's era. I can not tell the stories were particularly enlightening, but the charms lies in just how typical they are. The themes are universal and daily: love, friendship, and sacrifice. <br /> I have done much to enjoy the art of art and act. I felt I was getting a glimpse of a time and where I could never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially 4 women who played the main oysters, were a thrill to watch. I would only recommend this movie to those who want a taste in Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example both.
