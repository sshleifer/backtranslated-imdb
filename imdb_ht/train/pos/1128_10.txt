Although the latest re-said part of Homer's "Troy" season with Brad Pitt was once entertaining, "Iphigenia" and Irene Pappas's incendiary are breathtaking. Unfolding in a natural setting and Greek actors who speak their own language of authenticity. A chance to meet with this film in one of the many movies of the DirecTV keeps me interested in despite my concentration issues. There is no brilliant or "bling" of this movie, just a fabulously rich story impikably told by such real actors one feels out of a real family of turmoil. I think Homer, if it really exists, would be proud of this saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> JLH
