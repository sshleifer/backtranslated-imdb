This movie is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a kids would, for adults. The idea of ​​drawing a child becomes a place to visit physically and to influence is wonderful. At the same time you can find all child psychologists on it and say it is really exploring its subconscious, as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The bit that gives me goose-button is when her father is in the paper house, and chases her. The only thing I can not stop is that it's marketed as a horror movie ... it's really not. If you want to see something British and many scenarios that keep you guess without the usual good emotions most movies have to use, then watch Paperhouse.
