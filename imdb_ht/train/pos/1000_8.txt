I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well-done. I especially liked the opening stage which had a semi truck in it. A very tense action scene looks good. <br /> Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also the movie is funny is several parts. I also liked how the guy was wrong also described. I would give the movie an 8 out of 10.
