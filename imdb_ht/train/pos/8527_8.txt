Allow me to just get to the bottom line here: I had 3 children, aged 5 to 10. I considered a trip to the theater a success when there was no talking. I've seen most of our children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie reverses the Wizard of Oz, the 18-on-18 sexual harassment of El Dorado and the tragic flaws and the end of Rudolph Reindeer Red-Nose. I could probably tell Nemo's story in your own memory. <br /> <br /> What makes me support a child of mine (it varies) that suggests that title for the family movie in an evening? In one word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Time of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
