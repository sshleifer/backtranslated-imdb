Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as its most new job and most pirates, fantastic, and flying as it might be any better! The art is totally amazing with the soundtrack, which is reviewed many times later (I'm not sure if this was the first time I heard it) and reminded of the most emotional sentiment answer to any movie band. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally scary with the boy, Pazu is also a major role-model - she lives on her own! The draw is classic Miyazaki. I will not give it away, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of the three best Miyazaki and Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also you may want to check out the Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometime next year I hope) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it's readily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A
