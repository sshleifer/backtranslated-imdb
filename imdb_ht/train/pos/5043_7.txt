A very promising beginner for Bill Paxton. A very black / who is-really-done-it is recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong story, well combined on a devout, but demonic person in Thurman, Texas who goes on a spree killed after receiving orders from God to eliminate evil spirits trying to control humanity. A couple of twists of draws and a strange weird make for your moneys worth. Most of the violence you do not really see, but still enough to double up your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the tight man to be known as God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the old man's oldest son ends up telling this story of an agent Dallas FBI (Power Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and impeccable. Stop white knuckler! Very recommended.
