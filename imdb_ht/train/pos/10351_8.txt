When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) saw that the baby was dragged out of the tents by a dingo and then started an ordeal that no one should have experience. It seems like the Dingo story does not believe in the public or the press, and everything becomes a circus. Lindy does not help matters either because he will not play in the jury or courtroom, he's only himself, and he's a hard black crack, so of course everyone thinks he's guilty because there's a piece of non-evidence came to light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist leader, who doubts about his faith and maybe his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are similar to prejudice and stupid elsewhere as they are also in the United States, because the Australian public does not believe the story and the media are the only fans of the flames. Eventually, Lindy found guilty and sent to prison for a lifetime of hard work, but years later, a missing piece of evidence showed up and released, but not until after family life was fundamentally lost. A heart-breaking story, very well done, a bit long but well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
