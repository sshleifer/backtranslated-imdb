'Ned Kelly was born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross in Gallipolli'. So there was Nerd in arms. <br /> In Australia and especially Victoria, Ned Kelly's name can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta it's still a hero, the life of the city of Jerilderie depends on the creator he created, but in Mansfield still do not forget that the three policemen he 'was killing' were out of there. <br /> <Many of the buildings he's visited in his life are still standing. From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged, the post office he kept up in Jerilderie. A cell he once had in Greta is on display at Benella and the site of Ann Jones' Hotel, the station and even the logs where he captured in Glenrowan can visit. The events of the movie (except for his love interests) can be found all over Victoria, in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded and for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what leaves out would further justify Neds's actions. The Ned 'stole' horse was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man who ned boxes and after getting out of jail). Ned was already jailed when the horse was reported stolen so he could not have been stolen. The Jerilderie letter is much greater than what has been stated earlier. It's not self-justification it's Ned's biography, a description of what it stands for with whom it was protected. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make your mind about what Ned stands for.
