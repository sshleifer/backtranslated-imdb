Thanks to the Lord for Martin Scorsese, and love her in these films. <br /> This is the perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist working in today's cinema, and I could not recommend it much more. I was enthralled in the whole thing and you will also. Just relax and let it take you on a ride in his world, you will love it.
