This is a very good Spanish film but I'm worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Spanish war was all about or when it fought. When you were a story teacher, I had a great advantage but it could easily see how the film can be confused until you piece together all the pieces. I doubt if this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other audiences can be somewhat confused until later in the movie. The movie begins with 12 years Carol and her mother return to her mother's home town. Last year and you are gathering in Spain from New York City. Despite the unusual, Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and many of the movie is about how it fits. As for her and her mother alone, I'm going to spread it now for those who do not gather on the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the Republican side (which eventually loses in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The movie becomes exceptional for its beautiful camera and music work. The rather slow and rambling race gives you the opportunity to accept a movie that way. I've seen several other Spanish films about this shotgun and this compares very well - not better or worse - just a decent installment of movie life on those who stay behind as well as a nice come in great flick. /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side is that, Republicans have been mostly Socialist and have been backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The nationalists were led by Franco and were helped by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy.
