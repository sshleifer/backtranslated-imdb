It is not very often a movie can literally make all the laughing audience, and five minutes later fill the eyes and tears. Many movies try to do this, but some can save the emotional impact that this movie has made. Adam Sandler practically drags you into and heats up his violent and frequent violent, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not pull him down. I will not ruin anything, but there is only one particular scene that should have your eye watering and quivering lip. Even the worst of people should do bastards their beliefs do not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance but is out-shiny in Sandler. Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith books provide solid performances, but there is nothing in line with leading roles. Sandler Humor is still present, which actually saves this movie from being border depressing lines. There are several laughs to be there, but do not think you will stay there long, because it gets serious again without much warning. <br /> I could go on and off on how this movie hit on just about all the human body's emotions there, but I'll cut this short one. I feel no need to tell you anything more. Make yourself a favor and take time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it's out on DVD, it's 100% worth the time. A movie deeply moves to make sure you put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you're a heart soul.
