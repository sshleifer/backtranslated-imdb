With Harry Callahan getting up in the year, the inevitable 'old man with a chip on his shoulder's story came into play eventually. Callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, his attitude was still unconditional. Fortunately, this film took some time to develop a different kind of story, one that could reinvent Harry's room and the whole genre. While the film fell short of doing so, he was still an excellent addition to the series, though he got a little out of place during a time of unusual fashion trends with New Wave music.
