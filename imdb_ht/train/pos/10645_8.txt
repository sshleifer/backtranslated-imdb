Adolf Hitler's humanitarian desire imposed his will on the rest of the world is the second topic of a series of seven films produced by the US Department of Defense as a teaching tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during the Second World War. . Hitler's plan was methodical and well-conceived, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding to the European Heartland, then moving on the 'World Island' including Europe, Asia and Africa. His final move should reach all the oceans for the final conquest of America and the world. In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, as the rest of the country fell under his bad spell. Children's school songs are praised, and German youth have been trained and endorsed in military camps. Marching unopposed in Austria in 1938, Hitler followed by annexed a strip of land bordering Germany and Czech Republic called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was surprised to learn that Germany had signed a non-aggression park with Russia's deadly enemy, a scheme delaying Hitler's military involvement over too many fronts. Immediately, Germany invaded Poland, bringing Hitler's conquest right ahead of Russia. He would deal with it later. <br /> It was during that period that Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's violence across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had been awarded a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous statement stating 'peace in our time'. He did not turn out that way. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to be learned from this slice, at least to me, was given by a small fragment of footage from a German Hitler rally in the middle of the '30's. He was led by a German American to take his cue directly into the country. The venue - Madison Square Garden!
