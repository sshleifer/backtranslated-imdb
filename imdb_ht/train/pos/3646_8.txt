Wick Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor runner league who made one of the most amazing comebacks in the history of sports, which completed an almost 10-year retired and made his first major league 'in 1999 at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief summary of Morris's childhood, including a series of re-place - his father was a military man. And even when his family was established for good at Madison Texas football, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> The segment of children is then jumping ahead over 23 years of the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry professor at Big Lake High School (in real life he was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). He mentioned that he had tried a career as a baseball player but did not work out. Morris's team is struggling and lectures on giving up on their dreams. Turning the table over, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team. At several times when it came up in practice, they expressed wonder at the speed with which it launched. Morris looks compelling but agrees in a deal with his players in the if they win the district, he will try out for a Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake makes the district and, adhering to the end of the deal, Morris goes to a Tampa Bay devil rays to try out. Fennet, it launches 98 miles an hour - faster than it throws during its minor league career with an exceptional speed even for a larger League pitcher. After another try out with the team, Morris offered a deal with the Devil Rays. This leaves him with a difficult decision - staying in his comfortable life or once again pursuing his Big League dream he does not go to the miners league leagues to make little money and spend months in a time away from home. And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first lunar lunar because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs and the devil rays, starting at the AA level and moving quickly to AAA level, a level below Baseball Major League. But as the wind down, the chances of getting "calling up" grow increasingly slim. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I love this movie. There are many great performances and interesting characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris. Also, the film does a great job of showing professional baseball at both levels and major minor league. And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of keeping your dreams close even when it looks far and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie has some flaws. While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris Christian faith. But consider Disney's left wing wings, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Assume, a lot of exaggeration / fabrication has made the story more dramatic. But the 20-minute documentary on Morris included on the DVD features some facts that make his story more dramatic, but is excluded from the movie. For example, from birth to his family staying in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-sits 14 times. And his first league mining career ended after four operations in which he lost half of the muscle in his left (throws) shoulder, thus making him 98 kilometers even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good not just to watch the "rookie" but to watch the DVD documentary, check out the aforementioned link strengthened in the movie and probably also read biography Morris', titled "The Rookie." I have not read the book, but I hope for one of these days. <br /> But in general, the "Rookie" is a very good painting of a miracle story and is a powerful addict to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10
