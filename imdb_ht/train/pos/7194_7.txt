I rank this best of the Zorro.The interesting music notes to add punch to an exciting screen play. There is an excellent support and cruel support that will keep you guess until the final chapter. Reed Hadley does a fine job as Don Diego and its modern Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the big team directed at Whitney and English.
