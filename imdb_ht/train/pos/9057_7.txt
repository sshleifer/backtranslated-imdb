Let's keep it simple: My two kids have stuck this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-glass and just enjoy it. <br /> But the Pepsi Girl was excellent! <br /> And Kimberly Williams was beautiful gosh-darned hot, although it's not in the movie so much, so do not get too excited. <br /> It's not it's really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you look just once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the fathers.)
