Am I the only one to see the connection between the discussion of 'myths of sisyphus' myths and the married life? In Camus version is a man convicted of passing his eternity with a huge stone that he must climb a hill. Unfortunately every time he reaches the boulder's head slide and ends up back at the bottom for him to start. There was a pecking buckard in his eyes, I'm not sure now. In the film the movie spends his life struggling to get his life together, unfortunately every time he progresses any footsteps he falls and loses everything. The point should be the part it launches where it gets intoxicated, offending his falafel lover, it is practically attacked by liev schrieber. In case you question this theory, note how this scene ends and attempts to rush a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere to prevent its progress until it finally passes out. In the morning when she got up on the stairs, never reached the top.
