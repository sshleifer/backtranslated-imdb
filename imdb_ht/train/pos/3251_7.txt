But another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", Sergio Leone's rumor of the "Yojimbo" Kurosawa (suggested by the novel 'Harvest Red'). This one is simply a B-movie; Take that, it is rather enjoyable. The direction is dry, the full act of fiberglass, the boundaries of its direct-to-video photography are well occupied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Although Leone directs both 'Fistful' and 'West', his motivation behind these two films might not be different. 'Man with no name' (Eastwood) is a socio-pathway that has a soft touch for family breaks. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her own family break, and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have much to do with each other. In order to bring them together, 'crazy gun' has its draw twist and complicate it until we lose track of what history we are actually following. <br /> But this is a B-movie after all, and full of action and silliness; It's fun at this level, just do not expect anything more.
