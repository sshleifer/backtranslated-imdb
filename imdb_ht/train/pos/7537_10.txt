Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers as well as inspiration. It also provides reliable, logical and different viewing information than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think best. Unlike other programs, which provide social commentary and related faith, those behind the 700 Club provide help for needy, such as hungry foods and surgery blessings, provide medical help to people living in the poverty and give hope to those who need hope. It's not all lovers. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest arriving for the remote control and turning the channel on your TV set. I do the same when I get CNN Headline News or for this issue, the programs I get disadvantaged or offensive. What I get offensive is how ABC's family puts the notice that the opinions of the 700 Club do not reflect those of ABC families.
