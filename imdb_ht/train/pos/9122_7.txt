Purple rain is a great movie if you're a 40-something music lover who has been part of Prince's music in the 1980s. The story is a most used formula: rising music talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience with respect for itself. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially in Purple / I would die 4 U makes it worth sitting in the movie. He is himself and as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about thriller. Apollonia Kotero, an ancient Prince protects, is beautiful and shows some talent and chemistry acting with Prince, but his script does not leave him far away. Morris Days and other actors support to comedy elements.
