Perhaps I liked this movie much in part because I felt down in the storage and it's like a pretty little fairy. Whatever the reason, I thought it was stacking perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I was for a while. <br /> It's a very funny and smart movie. The joke runs in the government's history of wild imprisonment and the consequence, the way the delivery of magic effects to the witch and dozens of smart little touches all keep me enthralled. That's a lot of what makes it so good; It is an elaborate, special-effects-filmed movie that has more history than most movies, but has an incredible attention to little things. <br /> I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.
