"Erendira" is a movie from Mexico that rarely speaks about. The movie only exists in a format VHS format. It's a shame this movie was not given a DVD release. "Erendira" is stunning and gorgeous with its magical-realistic image. "Erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude". Erendira is constantly entering and accidentally burning her granny home. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, is her strength in prostitution to pay for damage. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although subjects of harsh sounds, the film does not exploit sexuality. It does in a mature artistic way. The movie also has some amazing costumes. Some of the most tight aspect of the movies are the origami birds that are morphed in real birds, and a gold ornament with a diamond in the center. Erendira is an amazing movie, which even manages to throw in humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD release. As they say in espanol, "It's nice to be good! Excellente!
