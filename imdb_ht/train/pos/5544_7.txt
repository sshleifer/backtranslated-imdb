PRC was the lowest in the bar actually hit gold with this little thriller Moody. They did the same thing a year earlier and "Detour" which is probably one of the finest low-budget films ever made. <br /> <br /> Strangler is basically a single set of films, filled with mist and shade, a technique used by most radio stations to hide the sets, or lack thereof. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (best known as Ming the Merciless) lurches around the swamp murder involves executing his cruelty for murder and generating some sympathy from the viewer. Her final victim is the ferryman's daughter ..... she focuses not only on people who are directly involved in her fate, but also relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche makes his usual imitation of someone in a coma that goes for style to act. He offered himself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the kill, but as a sop to the audience, strangler saw the goodness of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and it returns afterwards a bit chastened. If Ulmer (headed "Detour") headed "Strangler" he would hang in the nearest tree and the strangler task must do. But who's complaining? It's not the story that is the biggest attraction but lying sets, lighting and the general humidity of the piece. It stands, right behind "Detour", as the PRC's finest hour
