This drama is unlike Sex and the City, where women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. It is more personal and people can relate to it. She is more engaging and emotionally at a new level than other plays focusing on women and life such as "Sex and the City, Lipstick Lipstick ...." <br /> <br /> Katie Roden, is a psychologist with a dark secret, It seems more depressed and guilty to feed dogs than the rest of 3 friends. He faced death of his former lover who was his patient while tackling his son's progress on her. Her wet clothes and empty and cold homes transmit emotions inside it very well. <br /> <br /> Trudi Malloy, a widow fighting problems and "let go" to her dead husband from 9/11. But when a beautiful stranger, Richard shows an interest in it is suddenly forced to make a reality check by his friends who suggests that he gets into business dating. The ridiculous and nasty scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It's interesting to note that Richard asks him out the day he gets one million out of the 9/11 board for her husband's death ..lets see what his intentions are <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon is a The lawyer fed in her husband's tactic, which only involves "baby doing" (as there is design problems) and quickly falls to his colleague who offers his "service" a little too willing to read and does not hesitate for long! Interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica, a real business woman real estate is one and straightforward, until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has a affairs with one of them. Her character is portrayed as a bold and provocative woman before she encounters lesbian sex with a "married man", her colleague. Allow to see where it's character enterprise .... .... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama is that we show 4 totally different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. It is also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie with each other to be "safe"!
