Henry Thomas was "great". Her character has kept my attention. I was so "in" the story that I forgot it was not real. I wanted her to keep the baby and see what a special person she was. Others in the story were essential to the makeup of his character. The way they joined together to help each other was truly awe-inspiring. I love movies showing real-world emotions without having to hit you over the head, in that you're not smart enough to figure things out for yourself.
