While the story is sweet, and the dance and singing in the main part of the film is a joy, the uniqueness of the movie (and making it a prince) is the dream sequence. It presents the combination of the highest form of the truly American music (Gershwin), the beauty engaged in French Impressionist art, Kelly's enthralling choreography (including his rider "The Two of Friends", really a separate genre ), and the most beautiful palette of colors ever invented for the series. Matching the music flared and the visual explosion with these dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
