I love Paul McCartney. It is, in my oppination, the greatest of all time. I could not, however, pay a ticket to the Tacoma Dome during the Return of the US Travel. I was upset at least at least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I will enjoy this for years to come. <br /> I have one complaint. I would like to hear all Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also, Paul does not die. <br /> One older DVD concert ever. <br /> *** from *****.
