If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this movie, you will stay with a fantastic comedian. As it is, I still find it to be a very good movie, which is no small feat to consider the coma I've put in by the open scenes. To put it mildly, this movie has a sad start that did not even remotely remotely, or even optimistic. Once these things get sillier, however, you leave with a comedy that always holds up well after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who want to see their earliest jobs.
