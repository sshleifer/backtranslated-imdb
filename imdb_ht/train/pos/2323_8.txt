"Man of the Moon" is a very good movie. It is very touchy at times and it is very well done in all respects. I would not say that the movie was terribly original, but what are those days? <br /> <br /> Throw members have all done a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoy seeing Reese Witherspoon in such a young age, and doing well a good job. Jason London does a good job too. And only the other people I recognize is Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Thirty) a lot. At times it seemed to be what kind of dad you are scared, but in the end you really love his character. The rest of the cast was very good too. <br /> If you're in touching the movie growing up and dealing with what life is launching at you, then you have to watch this movie. I would suggest reading synopsis of conspiracy and if that sounds like something you should be interested in, then go for it. Anyhow, hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> -Chris
