This film shows what kind of ensemble works one will for each movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positive chilling, discussing "family business" as if it was a supermarket store or a dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman, and Knight are also terrific. They play in each other as members of a top-notch theater, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others without interest. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). What an amazing performance of a child ... and what a puzzling resemblance to Ullman, whose child he plays! <br /> We are treated in a unique history of "panic," and that is a rarity in those days of crap formal fatigue. The dialogue is sharp and clever, and this movie is relatively short maybe the power to provoke a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be fearful, to be sad, to be excited, to be upset, and to love. It's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy, but when it's over you are more than satisfied knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes with a darn piece of good work. <br /> <br /> The more we would go to the theater if we were treated at fare like this. When are the powers in Hollywood going to wake? It is a real shame when something good is neglected to find exposure beyond festivals and tenants sufficiently enough to have cable.
