Are we really doing 'video nasties' yet? In the guise of a large screen large screen screen of 8MM, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately there is a bit too much history and at this time become as a traveler as our heroine searches the sleaze spots in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. I am however rather churlish for the 'sins' scenes, including everything from hot wax, harsh hard and rough sex to walnuts, scratches and some. These scenes are Immaculate and it's a brutal Bruno and his budget could not stretch to make all the many characters present to become more than simply caricatures.
