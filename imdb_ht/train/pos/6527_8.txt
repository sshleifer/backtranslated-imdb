The documentary begins with the perspective of several years of light. The Voyager is traveling our milky and sounds in our life on earth, as a space monument for (possible?) Extraterrestrials. The documentary is based on Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. Hope J.B. has never been published before. The narrative is out of 'blind Willie' Dixon. However, it is done by an actor. The film shows the work of all those early blues followed by cover and interpretation by musicians, such as Nick Cave and the bad seeds among others. <br /> <br /> The death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a striking event in the story. Lenoir has engaged political engagements and is considered to be in the league of Martin Luther King and his classmates. His political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics. <br /> <br /> Blues have been found to be the 'native music' of America. Blues are the roots and the rest are the fruits. Soul titled 'a man' is after a song by Willie Dixon.
