I watched this series when she first came out of 70s. I was 14 years old and I looked at her best friend like my dad did not want to look it.it had become a weekly ceremony Sunday, and as anyone will tell you for two four-year-olds to watch a documentary of almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special. <br /> <br /> Bale at the age of the World War 2 events to make for a difficult topic in the document.so makers have broken it into what was considered the most important key key and to devote one episode Each episodic episodes covering time period like 'heavy pack' covering almost all six years in the Battle of Atlantic.while the Battle of Stalingrad had one episode of itself. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made today simply because most of those interviewed are dead.the list of important players appears to give an amazing insight into the thinking of the moment. Anthony Edin's foreign secretary, Carl Donnitz, h ead of the u ships, Albert Speer, pet architectural and later armanminist ministers for Hitler.in one of the episodes later we see the tragian whore, Hitler's secretary, who was with He was in the bunker and he had him dictated his last wishes and additions-he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped the lines. The Russians and many others played a major role in realism in events they are described. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism in her series is that the rope-breakers in park bletchly are not included, but the revelations in the parts of the war only appear after the series was made so I can not blame the program makers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles and magnificent music, and Lawrence Olivier's narratives lend a natural gravity to the script. <br /> <br /> the best documentary ever made? without doubt
