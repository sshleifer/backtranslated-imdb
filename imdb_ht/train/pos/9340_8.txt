** Possibly Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy, but in "Reign", it provides a deeply moving performance. While people have shown courage facing post 11,2001 September, Sandler plays Fineman, a widow who is lonely and "lost in his own world" .Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, old college friend (Sandler) meeting and wants to catch up on "Old Times" .We see, as in the Rain Man ( Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also becomes emotionally and removed from stress situations. Music music, appears to be a comfort and "psychological" crutch for him to lean over. <br /> <br /> Johnson looks for, at Fineman, that's certain fun and lacking facilities in her family. She also feels happy and contentious at Job.In same example, She also wants to ensure that her friend does not falling into the "social cracks" .I was away from this movie, with a different and more sympathetic outlook for Compassionate Families.
