A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. A great cast of his mix with an intriguing draw is overseen by a Twin Peaks-acute influence of director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very obnoxious actor and shows a great man's paintings in a tie looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP of a great actor) is still a beautiful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It is such a shame he never did in a higher profile of the biz. I'm sure she has her followers, though. In all, this is a great movie that shows you that you do not need big bangs or a commercial band to be an entertaining movie.
