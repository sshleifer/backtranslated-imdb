I must admit, I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before any information was distributed. I was determined that he was going to have a cheap turn-off guided by Ronald D. Moore to handle the retkan-wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot left an excellent impression on the viewers. The access is wonderful! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the First War. (58 years before the BSG pilot event). The pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plots and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We present with a humor, ceremonial drama packed by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> The distribution keeps the BSG standard; Stoltz and Morales are simply surprised. Morales 'Portrait of Joseph Adam, inspired by Olmos' paintings of William, gives a wonderful glimpse to William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrait of Dr. Graystone provoked a lot of questions and questions. If the adequate pilot is any indication of what has not yet come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue the BSG heritage of first-TV programming TVs and other TV masterpieces.
