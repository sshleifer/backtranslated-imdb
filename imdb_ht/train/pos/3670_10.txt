I rent this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and as I'm about film-making study in Canada anywhere, I certainly will bring this up to class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the most unlucky movie team in the story of his film itself, is brilliantly written and actors are very talented to manage to deliver every single pony over time. <br /> <br /> If you simply could not laugh during "Hollywood North" I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the wonderful script I even noticed the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really just act? Jennifer Tilly (playing hilariously bad actress) and Martin Landau, also delivers a very orgy, yet funny performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie, even better to throw.
