This is a well-paced movie rhythm, slowly building the story of an ancient strip that begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here ... I really liked this movie though it left a bit of bitterness in the end. It is smart, well-trained and very well-acting. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply in their character. <br /> <br /> A little bit "pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> A thriller that does not seem like one. A very original movie, very particular atmosphere throughout the movie though you might feel awkwardly a few times with a couple of scenes. <br /> I'll give it an 8/10 !!
