How to lose friends & Alienate People at all honesty one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Brother Fees. It's not one of these "gross out" comedies that heavily relies on fart jerk and humor junk but instead moves at a bare pace and you'll be easily attached to the unfolding narrative. Simon Pegg nails her in the casket and her hilarious painting of a fish-out-of-water character and is far tearing herself out of the stingray she once belonged to England (the other should be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting yourself to the top of the food chain Hollywood is a hard thing to do as we can see clearly with Pegg, his first in the lead role of comedy David Schwimmer runs Runboy but has received warm reviews from critics and even audiences. Second attempt to read this film, has received positive justice review from the majority, but it was a flop in the box office. I, for one still does not lose faith in it and I will always be anytime he wants to take that third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters have been thoroughly cast in Jeff Bridges Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst in my opinion packed well in this movie as the likes of Pegg's character however, is the spark that I've seen in the interview with the vampire still losing. He needs to get it, fast or he might suffer the consequences of losing the country in "rom-coms" forever.
