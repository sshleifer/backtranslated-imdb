Halloween is one of those movies that gets you deep skin! It is in my opinion, the frightening movie of all time. Michael Myers is Boogeyman is best ever! It was just terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effect where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a note score one, yet managed to scare hell from people. 25 years and this film still has the same effect as it did in '78. <br /> It's about a boy Michael Myers and killed his sister at age 6 and so many years later escaped the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him, he will do anything to get him back, since he described Michael as "... worse. The Dark Eyes, the Devil's Eyes". Michael is on a mission though, killing his other sisters Laurie, playing by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has babysitting on Halloween, while her friends come out and of course, we know the rules and find it! But Laurie can stand a chance since she is the maiden. ; D '<br /> <br /> Halloween pays a lot of homage to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, Janet Leigh's daughter. Halloween is an absolute film that breaks limits and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and lock the lights! "They're going to get you! They're going to get you!". Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
