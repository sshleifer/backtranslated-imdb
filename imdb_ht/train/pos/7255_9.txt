This is not a movie you look for entertainment, at least most people I know would not. <br /> It's the portrait of the cruelty of both body and spirit that comes in a very good war, the characters seem likely, especially because you "read the minds", something most often found in books and rarely Movies, however, do very well in this piece. I would put it around "All the quiet on the west" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. I wish I could screen it in school, with the other two movies - however finding a copy he showed to be very difficult - that's a shame.
