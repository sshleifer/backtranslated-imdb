LOL !!! Delirious was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys impressions are absolutely spot on. The best impression was James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It's strange how Eddie Murphy was back then and how it is now delirious is a must see, but if you do not like bad language does not look but amusing and so crazy .. I've seen it 6/7 times and he always peeed myself every time .. This is Eddie Murphy in his prime, and you can see where he got the humor and ideas of movies like nutty teacher from. It also impresses with her family, which is real funny. <br /> if only i was there ...
