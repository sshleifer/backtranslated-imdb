The party where Meg visited the mechanic and he said - "Does the piston shoot short?" (involving poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc√©) was hilarious.

Hero of the garage mechanic garage transformer physicist properly. Einstein had a romantic side of his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and hearing was done well. It's really misunderstood and deserves hugs and attempts at a revival. It lost one vote to include was the most probable far-sighted theory that was bought by the US Govt. I do not see why she does not figure in the top 20 romantic comedy of the century. Great Movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!
