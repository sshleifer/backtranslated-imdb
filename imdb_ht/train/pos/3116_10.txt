The final installment of the frisonized franchise franchise is just that probably the hardest hit in the three films. He goes further to playing the anti-bond term. Bourne does not like what he is doing and wants to know about his past disorder. Everything about this movie hit it on the nail from the choreography of choreography / cascade works in the acting script. The movie starts from a flurry as Bourne runs out of the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the movie first left. Or does it? The time is little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne will remember things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself almost gets him hold, but he does it and does not kill anyone. They do not target it. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past and a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past and Bourne as well. The cinematography is in your face following closely on virtually everything. Car chases even more intense if that seems possible than those from the first two. And Bourne's veteran cast run is superb and a nice party by Albert Finney. He also has little political politics in relation to policies and other government policies, but this is minor and integrates very well into the plot. All of this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best trilogy of action ever.
