I thought Hugh O'Conor was surprised as Christy Brown's youth, and really deserved great recognition for his role. I could not believe how he played the party. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where boys are playing football and Christy uses himself to stop the goals and then kick off the sanction! Amazing performances by the two Krisys (and others).
