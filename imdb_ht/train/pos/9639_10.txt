A very close and sharp discretion in the world of bubbling and emotional dynamics of 18year old special guys, who first experiences her in gay love of another boy, during a vacation with a part of her family. /> I like this movie because of the storytelling extremely clear and remarkable story, with all this "sound-lock-ups" and quiet moments filled with intense humor.
