Spacecamp is one of the movies that just love kids, and mom and dad can have fun watching too. Growing in the 80's I enjoyed this movie and drawn to all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD so when I have kids in my own, they will be able to have lots of fun watching this movie as I did. The plot is fun, A group of kids, embarking on a never-ending journey when rocketed into space by a surachieving robot. They were in the first auh, but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to make it the panic flow. Once they recover enough oxygen from the space station to return to earth as even better friends and a new one has been given respect for life.
