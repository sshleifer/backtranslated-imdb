This was second in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today. As I can look at it now on DVD and see how it builds, I am very impressed with Bernard L. Kowalski's direction (who led the CALLAHAN's good CALLAHAN as well as countless TV episodes) - watch how post-murder action In the assassin shown on a split-screen effect on his two glasses, see how the murder itself shows in montage mode, watch the point-of-view shot from the perspective of the corpse. Also, the beautiful but impressive avant-garde music note from Jazzman Gil Melle was unbelievable and helped many to create atmosphere. And the support performance of Brett Halsey as the golf pro was wonderful - such as subtlety and complexity in a new role from ten times then would be a cutout of one dimension. The "Formula" has not yet been set when the episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in the Columbo method. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp, and Ray Milland are the best actors and it is a pleasure to see them work - everyone is familiar with many other roles again losing themselves to the characters here. In all of this, this entry in the Columbo series - and many of the others - are as well-crafted as a very good feature film.
