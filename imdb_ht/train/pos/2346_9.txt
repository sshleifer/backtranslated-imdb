Very sweet pilot. The rakes show in Tim Burton's best film ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, the narration, the music, the external sounds all shouting Tim Burton. There is a connection, or a STRONG influence, I just did not do enough research to know where it is. As I saw in the forums, yes, Anna Friel is playing a poor man of Zooey Deschanel. Whenever I see him on the screen I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a good job. Her character is very sweet and adorable and you easily get attached to it. It's more of a distraction that I keep thinking "Why did not find Zooey Deschanel". Lee Pace does a great job too. I kept trying to remember where I knew her out and just looked at her. Wonderfalls !!! Great, short live in 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies you must go to Wonderfalls, which is another complete creation of Brian .. hmmmm <br /> love seeing Swoosie Kurtz (World Under Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors ) again. Two underrated characters actors never fail to perform it with their performance.
