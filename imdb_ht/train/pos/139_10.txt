First of all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Nice combination of strange 'dogma style' style in telling the story with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there's not the 'end'. As for me it's acceptable. I thought ... how it will be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have some ideas. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure third parties without Helmer would not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mayble little little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not make little experience with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-animated animation (like for example "America team" by Trey Parker) or even 3D animation computers. I know he's not the same as a real actor, but in principle I believe he could work ... only in this way it is possible to make the actor alive again. For this riget fan would not be big difference - if the animation will be done in the right medium watcher will be considered normal just after the first few shots of the movie. The most important thing is now the story. It fully understands that it is not possible to create riget 3 and the actors nowadays. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the possibilities that he gives you! Even one marketing! Large director ends his trilogy after 10 years using animated puppet animation. Just dreaming? <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 a day ... or even to see just the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and as I hope - everyone here doing. <br /> <br /> Greets, slay <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about "The Hospital Kingdom" by Stephen King ;-)
