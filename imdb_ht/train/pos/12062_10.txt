This movie has made my effort since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mum looked at her when she was on the phone back in '92. I remember being picked up in the night by his tearful ramblings as my dad helped him to step up the stairs. <br /> She said something like "Do not let her get me" or something like that. I asked what made him so upset and he told me he was watching the woman in Black. So obviously I had to watch her, and even though I was only eleven she left me. It's scary s *** from me. I was the horror movie immune since watching this!
