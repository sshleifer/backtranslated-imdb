We often see movies about unwanted things going on in politics, but I always recommend "City Hall". In a role she was born to play, Al Pacino star as New York mayor who has to deal with shooting at a boy. But it turns out that there is nothing that he does will really have any effect. In this movie, the characters are as fearless as we would expect of anyone who participates in a political scandal. No matter how much you believe a given politician, you can doubt your posture. <br /> I understand that I can not name any specific example of something similar to what this movie shows, but that's not the point. If we had the ideal impression of people at the top, this movie tears these ideas down. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also begins Jan Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
