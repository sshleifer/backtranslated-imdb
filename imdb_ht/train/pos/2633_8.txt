I have to be honest, I was expecting a failure so badly, because it really sounded like they were trying the original movie milk to get money. But that was not the case with very funny films (sometimes odd). I liked how to tell the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and his sleep disorder was funny. Bubble jacuzzi, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's fun in harmony, good for kids and some adults. I think this film will last for a while because it is rather good for a straightforward video and DVD movie. While the film seems a little odd and kind of trail toward the end, it works. 8 out of 10
