Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that depicts how many cultures are common in common but are not even aware of the influence that each society has on another. David Redmon opened your eyes and allowed you to see how the workers in China manufactured shingles that cost little nothing and are selling in America for up to 20 dollars. When Redmon asked the Americans aside the shovels from them there was no sign and seemed mute was founded. When he told them that they were doing in China for less then nothing and pay horrible and unacceptable conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt, and slightly remorseful but did not really seem to would stop buying the shades after finding out the truth. When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans were wearing their neck and paid much for these beads. The workers laughed at the goal behind the shovels could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own. <br /> Pitts
