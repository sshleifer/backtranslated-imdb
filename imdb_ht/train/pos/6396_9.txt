Do you think you've got it hard? You should check out this movie. Carl Brashear is exemplary courage and determination. What this man went to become a sailor diver, should be an inspiration for all of us. And significantly, after seeing this movie, I learned that what shows is not even half of it! Cuba Buy, Jr doing some of her best work on the date of Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is as good as redneck to his south train. George Tillman's only second-best feature (after "Soul Food"), made a propagation of growth as a cinema. If you want them to move and inspire, you definitely need to check out this one.
