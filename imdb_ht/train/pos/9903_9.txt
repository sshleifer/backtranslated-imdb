Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I tried to remember this name f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now. High Massage, People! Hells ye! <br /> I will not do you with a draw summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, 'cause you all know what's up. That's why you're here anyway. What I'm going to do, however, is to explain the fantasy memory I have in this 80-D joint film is very important. <br /> In 1987, when I was around the age of 7, my father used to rent all those horror movies. Would she take care of her children watching over her? No. So at that age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this movie stuck with my big time. I have not seen it since, but I remember that day most of the ridiculous killings of the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why there is a metal bed in a school?) Become electrocuted. Or, the guy was drowned in a sister pool. Come! My favorite personal, though ... the stomach explodes from the beer stained. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? Then, his belly exploded? What !? With this great line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic crap all the way. <br /> I mean, I look now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at it. But when I was 7, I was scared sh! San. This jester hat (or was it a mask?) That rock killer at all freaked me f * ck! <br /> Of all, yes, a heavy film. But for nostalgia reasons and for humorous factors this film gets a 9 out of 10 from me. Either stay every night either late and hope to catch this even at the end of late late film shows, or hunt down a VHS copy and dust into your VCR.
