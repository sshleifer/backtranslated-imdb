So I still have nightmares. <br /> This filial movie (a music) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> A boy left on a magical journey to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, allegedly dragons, looking more like a newt and my conjunctivitis, and a magic speaking flute are targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered a 'bit of Well' in time). <br /> <br /> The flute is recovering from an exciting 'convention contest', and the witches that have an old gay time. The boy dressed in drag then as a 'fairy' to recover the flute. <br /> No suitable for children.
