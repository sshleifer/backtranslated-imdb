The Young Victoria is a beautiful movie and presented Queen Victoria in a different light of what everyone thinks about it. These films are wet "I'm not amused" the impression of Queen Victoria and she was a happy young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love stories, particularly Victorian stories, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this movie published, so I was so excited and counted down the days until it came to the movies. I was a little worried that it would not be historically accurate but it was and I loved it. I found new information about Queen Victoria who did not know before and she interested me very much. Queen Victoria's very light was one of the greatest ever monarchs, and this film depicts a picture of her real personality and what her life was like. He has treated so much by advising his mother Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regulation. This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which he was! Romans between him and Albert were so deep and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friends, who were both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look at an important part of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
