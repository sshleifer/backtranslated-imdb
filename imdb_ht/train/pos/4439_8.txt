The best-selling romance romance Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance of the beautiful Bryant Virginia), her husband Tom (Paolo Serra's likable), and Bobby's son (Pretty played by Patrizio Vinci) goes to a remote mansion in the country for summer vacation. Local legend claims that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, hulking (hulking David Flosi in a tremendous costume costume) living in the basement. Cheryl has surmounted her fear-child sitting frightening of the animal so he can defeat the bad find. Director / co-writer Lamberto Bava does an expert work to create and sustain a normal mood and nightmarish unnerving. In addition, Bava eschews standard blood'n'guts scroll routines flicker in favor of elaborating a compelling and provocative dark adult leaf-like fairy on the best way of overcoming what our fear is to face head quarters on. Robustly supported by Sabrina Ferilli as friend Anna's friendly friends, Stefania Montorsi as hottie Babysitter Maria, and Alex Serra as painter Batty Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's brilliant cinema boasts some few fluid shots and lots of atmospheric lighting. Gnarly Fabrizio Sforza make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's beautiful spooky'n'shuddery spotty note, and dank, dark, cobweb covering squares put all hit the skin-pulling place. Well worth seeing.
