Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of first-person shooting and ups. He tells the story of Patrick Galloway an expert in the occult and a horrific fighter called by a friend of his estate in Ireland to investigate some strange Phainomena. The game is set in Ireland after World War One so do not expect to get guns like chainguns or rocket launchers.All weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun of the game is its spells and the system to operate on Our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time: he drafts spells with his right arm and uses his gun with the left.So you can shoot and throw the same spell The time is how you understand many fun and also unique in this game! Graphics are great and can run very well on a power level P.C..Level design is also cool and atmospheric. Mostly the game revolves around the estate Contract with the castle but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker the game has an excellent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first person shooter) and I said before a great and very spooky voice acting voice is also good, but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example going to that room all the doors in the house will be closed apart from the people leading to the hall of your mission this can save time but it limits your freedom exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antique can not appeal to most FPS players who use high-tech weapons. As far as the difficulty surrounding the game is very well balanced. Most of it is in medium difficulty but sometimes it gets harder, but not frustratingly difficult. In general engineered is a great game. Definitely one of the best fxs out there.
