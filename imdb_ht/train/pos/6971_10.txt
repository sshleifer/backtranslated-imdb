Of course the average "sci-fi" star fights Gallactica will hate this. This kind of joy makes me happy. I do not like these cheese sci-fi shows especially battles-star Gallactica and that's why I love this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show got a lot of heat to do this (subject to the original -fashion way) and was worth it. I read about the Wiki that they wanted to appeal to everyone including women and not just sci-fi nerds. This is probably the most promising show ever since. It has the most interesting, smart, and profound script in any show at some time and it's really unique. <br /> What I like most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great Anime! From young teens running around shooting gun, with extremely well balanced and complex script, in his robot reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
