With a minimal budget, a long run of eight minutes and a large number of fantasies, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most movable shorts I've ever seen. Subtlety of the scenario is really remarkable, since it does not give the finish going until the very last moment. <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what's short is over, since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for her one-man show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable shortage is the most remarkable effort I have seen over the years. Also pay attention to Marta Belenguer's performance, its incredible reactions. <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
