I did not know what to do except for my thoughts that it was a lot better not to have a lot. Do not get hurt I'm not a bad movie short. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new and writer directing that she deserves a lot of kudos to make this film. You can say that it was an act of love for her. The act (outside of Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really good budget film. There were times when the story line became entangled and there are parts that dragged on, even though I do not feel much detracts for someone's ability to understand the movie. If you like Dominic Monaghan as long as I do, I say to go. Bob the gag was fun, I will not spoil it but have a particular scene that makes the DVD purchase worth it just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the movie then check out the Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
