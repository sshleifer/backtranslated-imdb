OK I'm honest, when I saw the first trailer for the program, I thought it was an ad for some solar-screen products. And the people are walking around on the beach. Despite that I decided to watch it, think it would be some new shows I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> In the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked, why is it lying in the trees, why did the aircraft etc. etc. <br /> It's not every day that a show comes together that combines intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But 'Lost' manages all of this. With a great cast and crew, beautiful places, and beautiful decent special effects, 'Objects' will catch anyone who's tune in, and it is a must see for anyone who is sick of sitcoms cheesecake and television television reality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
