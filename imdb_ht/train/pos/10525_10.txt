I have no idea how a Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow have ever pulled this on but that again will remind you that all the fuss about Madame Paltrow was in the first place! I have long gone to the woman and always feel it is rather dull at Oscar-winning "Shakespeare's Love" performance but it gets all the beats right here - it's close to perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for that. Of course, she was surrounded by a great cast of support including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and al ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as the love interest, though the script slows a bit of her declaration of love Paltrow (in the process, allowing all the tension of drainage from their relationship); Several years ago, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than she was in '96, and, personally, I found poke Alan Cumming a presence grate at anything nowadays. But the exception is, without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Law Phyllida) as Miss Bates; what version this need is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, as it is the character whose fate is drawn. The movie is worth watching (again) for its own performance. <br /> <br /> All in all, this magic age and charm and reserve and more than enough subtleties sort out the British class system. Well worth a rental (because it's easy that Paltrow will ever be good again - but we'll always be Emma).
