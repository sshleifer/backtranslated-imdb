One of my favorite films first saw it when I was about 10, which probably tells you so much about humor. Although dating humor definitely has a charm on it. Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch plenaries so popular in its day, with lots of interesting, original co-characters. The lady and the parrot, the couple due to couples and in the 'read' issue, and my favorite, the stationmaster, "Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes .." Interesting the train Ghosts were written by Arnold Ridley in the Fame of the Army of God (Private Godfrey Medicines) Watch it on a Sunday afternoon after lunch and smile.
