Shot in the heart is wonderful. It's brilliantly illustrating the combat Gary Gimore, a murdered murderer who asked for death. Shot in the heart shows Gilmore's family's relatives, torn up by hatred, walk away. This film is an incredible psychological study, and it is beautiful depressions and uplifting. 10/10
