After the initial trauma to realize the bravery of Mr Branagh this movie, I was literally shaking with the excitement that this season just went before me. I was not disappointed. So, true Shakespeare and yet so accessible. He blows my mind. I still enjoy seeing, or rather listening, Branagh and she made me wonder ... is this armed film in other countries? It should be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
