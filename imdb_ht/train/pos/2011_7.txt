If you have never seen this movie with time veteran actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and very thin and the jaw run and a wonderful voice that sang some great old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) has given an outstanding performance and many dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol, (Cyrus Drake) has been providing a great support with Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who has made classic piano and has no funny baton as he did in his career. This is not a great music, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
