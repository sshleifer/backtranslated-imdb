Whenever a movie is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life any of his photos will be seen for generations after generation. Just with Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", '47 appears and starts in the movie making it even more of a great Classic Classic. In this movie, Ellen Ewing is married and then he meets all kinds of mental and even mental problems. The mystery becomes much involved with Robert Ryan, (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", '65, comes to Ellen's help and sometimes you even ask about David being on the up and up. As you see this picture you just about finding yourself beginning to understand who is real nutty and all a sudden, you start to change your mind how the film will end. Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan has played a totally different role than it usually shows on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer, was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie, with great classic actors!
