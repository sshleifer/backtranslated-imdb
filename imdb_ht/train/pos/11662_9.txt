The secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful, and eye-popping animated films I have ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a choo-to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious contender . The secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the Abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a bit too strict and more concerned with strengthening the city wall from an attack coming by Vikings than it is in encouraging boy's imagination. When Aidan's legend (similar looks like Willie Nelson) showed up and took the boy under his wing, Brendan went on a trip to the woods and met a beautiful jungle nymph called Aisling who took a liking to him (and saved his life more than once). With Aisling's help, he tried to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mysterious book that could be dark in light. <br /> See my complete review of the secret of the Kells: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
