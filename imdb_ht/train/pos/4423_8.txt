GOJOE takes a little getting used first, but the final result is very satisfying. The story, about a murderous samurai seeking to redeem himself does not oppose a suicide, but dangerous, is worth more than one look. There are a lot of pillars here, from surviving physics to rescue sojourn. The film may seem somewhat similar to the animated film Samurai first, but it eventually delves into more mature / adult territory soon after. <br /> <br /> Do not be missed. GOJOE is one of the best samurai movies to come in post-Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and other foreign movie reviews)
