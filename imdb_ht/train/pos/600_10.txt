Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his millionaire absent father (the Wise Riding Creeper) in a sprawling windmill catch-up and finishing up tangled into the dangerous web of his young, chilly and seduced active in hell (Yummy Clare Wren), thereby causing problems for the already dysfunctional family. A noble, stylish and interesting drama that has received no promotion and sent straight to VHS and cable TV - where I saw her first. It is very well written, smartly acting, and tightly out of a script that keeps you biting your nails. I can not believe the revisions that he never actually saw. It's a classic unknown.
