Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so much to ask them to look. However the movie greatly exceeds my very high expectations. <br /> It is so much more than just a representation of a century. He has very real portraits of the characters in it and most of the actors perform an amazing job. These different stories are cooked together with real feet from the time that gives it a very unique touch. While watching it I really felt that I care about what happened to the characters. <br /> I would also like to give endless numbers of praise to Julia Stiles in her painting of Katie, she's great in a way that stands out! <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone.
