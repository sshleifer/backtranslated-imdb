This review is for the prolonged cut in this film. <br /> I first looked at Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I still love this movie and you can read some of the most positive reviews in it to get ideas in general. <br /> <br /> What they said. I have always found the scenario somewhat confusing. The movie is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute battle scene. <br /> Well, in the extended version this is not so. The old "original version" begins with a great barrel-rising / rugby sequence that is the sequel to the new end of the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging from his house and pretends to be training and reciting every time his father is around. <br /> <br /> Other sequences have also been altered or extended in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you look at it. The rally is also best and in general it just works better. It feels more like a love story and does not let you ask questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does. <br /> I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong movie, or just plain Jackie Chan fans to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie as it was originally intended. (Or at least that's how I think it was intended. For other things to do it and rearrange some of the scene) When I was watching it, I felt like I was watching a completely new Jackie Chan film although most of the sequels were the same.
