I do not know the stars, or modern Chinese teens - but I know a movie quite fun when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is the best of Hollywood in its value - it's played for laughs, for love, and is a great mix of kung fu and basketball. Everyone seems to have been very pleased to do so - their excellent production value - and modern China looks glossier than Los Angeles here. <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphan is grown to a kung fu school only to kick out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play (and love with more etc.) is great - this is cool, fun and very fun. <br /> With great action and good dialogue is one simply enjoying - for all ages - and for our money was one of the finest movies our family will see in a long time. <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really happy we did - a good movie comedy movie.
