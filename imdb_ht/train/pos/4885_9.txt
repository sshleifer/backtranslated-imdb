Possible Possible Possible: late-appearing culinary <br /> <br /> Rarely make one see many amateur and character memorable actors (almost whole actress to be precise) in one movie. Though some only appear to comeos, each person is a gem. The British make this mix of comedy and real life passionate better than anyone IMO, so it is no surprise that most of the actors are Brits. There is no doubt many have to be armed (do Leslie Caron * really * play the bass well ... maybe - who knew?) But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm summary sounds still turning my crank like some other jazz musicians. <br /> <br /> As an aging musician myself, not quite as old and certainly not in this course class, it was an encouraging film as well - a great movie for anyone asking if they are past in their profession or avocation whatever it can. And of course a great celebration in the life of the stage. <br /> I missed a little at the opening, but an interim 9/10 - and it certainly does we want to see everything there.
