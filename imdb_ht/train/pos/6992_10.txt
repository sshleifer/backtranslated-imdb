I would not say this is a bad movie; In fact it is very typical of the kind of movie that "dishonest rows" studios have been released at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in her role as a physician who is somewhat deaf, masquerade as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and her henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides and, after their destruction, inject Bela's wife with a serum taken from the body in order to keep her young. Lugosi is more than up to the work of doing so an enjoyable movie, however, the film suffers from ultra-wood acting in co star Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (beautiful name for a guy in a horror movie) is especially bad in this case. I saw him in many movies and TV shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and permanently compelling. Miss Walters is just a little better, but it's too much to miss the acting act of being credible. Still, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi acting out yet another clever scheme only to be deleted at the end! Although the poor act by some, "Vanishes in Cadenza" is an enjoyable movie for everyone to see.
