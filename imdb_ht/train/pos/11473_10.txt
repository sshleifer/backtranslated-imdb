Zero Day is a few films that have come to light, and what a shame that is. When I saw at the end, where the two main characters came down to the room and pity murder, then committed suicide, and it made me take my stomach. I was shaking, that's how strong this film is. The movie is amazing. It's too incredible to find a perfect ten. It's sad that so some people understand the true beauty of this movie. It is not a budget that makes a good movie, it is the amount of feeling the musicians put into it that makes it good. <br /> It leaves a permanent impression of yourself that you simply can not get out. It makes you realize the true horror of shooting - especially if you knew this person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> I recommend zero When people feel they are mature enough to watch it. I'm fourteen, and I feel that this movie is just too amazing to be put in words. It feels like you're watching something that actually happens.
