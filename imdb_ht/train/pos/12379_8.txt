I was a pageant in an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it's even more weird and terrifying on the big screen. Although it was about 9 years since I've seen it, it's still one of my all-time favorites. At the risk of sounding, "They just do not em up like this again!" If Sixth Sense freaked you out at all, this movie is definitely for you! Great scenarios, incredible cast of characters, menacing settings; Even the band has a great haunt. I highly recommend you do not look it alone. What a brownstone apartment was rented for in 1977 by itself, will you gasping (it would be at least 10-times that price today).
