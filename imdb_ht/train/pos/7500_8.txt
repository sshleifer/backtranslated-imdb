If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed by completing the AL. Not only is this feature of the rare mockumentary of Yankovic's most memorable videos ("Like a Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" in the middle), but they are inter-spliced ​​with comic strips supposedly by riding the parody fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be slowly amused. Fans-harders will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look at currently almost three prospects for Yankovic's. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love the funny comics.
