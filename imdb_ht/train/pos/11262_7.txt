DEPIL is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I'll say it is far more enjoyable than WILDCATS's painfully dull Swedish and unerotic Swedish, it's still a bit slow and unexplained for my taste. <br /> This one center of a group of vampire girls who live in a mansion, which wants to resurrect have already been murdered "leader". In order to do this, the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and singing strange things - and of course drink some blood, too. When a doctor and his brother's car crash and have to stop at the housing mansion - they give the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires ... but they may not be as discouraged as they look ... <br /> <DEPAR Play DEPIL is a great good example of exploiting the early 70's. Many naked - including some full-front, some sucrose succes - including incest and of course, lesbo-bloodsucking ... but those scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. Some nice hot women in this one, would have benefited from some explicit gender, but I guess you can not have it all. Also would benefit from some violence / gore, being that it is a vampire movie, but I think the goal of playing in the DEVIL was much more to show skin, not blood. Still a little slowing - and the act for the most part is absolutely wooden - but this must be expected from something that comes out of this era and in this budget. Worth a look of exploit fans - others can find it a little too dull for their liking. 7/10
