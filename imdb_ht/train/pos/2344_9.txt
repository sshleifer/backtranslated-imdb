I'm one of those who usually watch programs and keep my feelings on a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the unveiled advertisements that gave glimpses to the quoted at the show. I was skeptical about it first, especially after the final of six feet below was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, the third, and all the episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a manner that was gout without morbid. The characters were engaged and I loved the thought of the main character Ned could not literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of his death. Most characters have a longing for things they can not have. In addition to Ned and Chuck, long olive oil for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for Chuck and Emerson are always eager for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths to resolve. I think the characters are perfect and credible pictures. I love how Emerson who is black plays off in the rest of the characters since as an African American; I love subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes out of it. <br /> In all, this visual fairy is one of the most important pieces of entertainment that I've seen from the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for romance and enough to-do for the mystery enthusiasts. I just want the writers to get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.
