I saw Maslin Beach a couple of times - both on free television when in Brisbane. I will not go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise as others were well and really covered. <br /> I'll say it is so Australian. Only in Australia we can have a movie about relationships among those who spend the day as naked as the day is held, and see it on free commercial TV. <br /> I have a friend in the US who is still amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to home country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just examples too. Although our government is trying to turn us into the 51st US State, it's good to know at least some things that really look like Aussie
