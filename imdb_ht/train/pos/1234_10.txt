I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it as much today as when I was a kid. Do not listen to critical reviews. They are not accurate on this movie.Eddie Murphy really shines in her rolls. You can sit with all your family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone to see. It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With evil spirits, dragons, and a little bald little children with God like their power. This film takes you from LA Tibet, in to the amazing look of the wonderful temples in the hills of Tibet.Just a nice look! So go make yourself a favor and snatch this one up! You do not regret it!
