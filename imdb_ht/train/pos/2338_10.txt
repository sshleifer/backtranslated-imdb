Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been tried. That's the case, but the addition of the narrator and Dr..Suess like scenery makes this show a must look. With innuendo adult throughout the series with a touch of childhood in the series, the show is both ominous and invigorating. Part of the investigation shows there is not that flying inferior viewer plot and lover's favorite lines across all paradise seems to be what keeps loyal viewers coming back for more. This is a success that ABC should never let go. Bravo ABC. LOST got old, the way to revitalize the first time. 9 episodes before the strike writers leave the audience wanting more.
