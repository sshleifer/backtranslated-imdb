Offside is the story of young girls who tried to sneak into the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying football match in Tehran that can lead Iran to World Cup 2006 in Germany. Women are prohibited from going to the stadium by law in Iran, although many of them are dressed as boys and sneak in. Each stadium's search engine stops to ensure that nobody carries fireworks and of course; no girl gets in. Like most of Panahi's work, his cast performance was superb. You actually think you're watching a documentary. The dialogues between girls and their private were executed nicely and amazingly credible. The film depicts the interactions between the prisoners and the shooting guards that themselves are serving mandartory away from relatives and friends in a funny sort of way. In the end, the audience realized that there was not such a difference between the girls and the guards who just followed the order.
