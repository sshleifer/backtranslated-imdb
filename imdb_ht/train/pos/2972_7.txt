I must admit I'm a big fan of South Park and he hoped Basketball should be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie is full of replays and at any point they are very worried. The humor style stomach style humor mix with Stone and Parker just works perfectly. The type of humor present in Basketball was not popular about when it was released and it came out today it would be a hit. Do not bother trying critics, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come up. Recommended to anyone with a sense of humor.
