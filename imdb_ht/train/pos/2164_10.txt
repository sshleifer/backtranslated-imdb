Watch this last night and was launched on by the sincere story line, excellent development of characters, and good of karmic vibe evidently from acting and film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much of the plot, it starts with an ordinary joe who committees at his desk office every day that gets inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters meet in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learning lessons about others and over themselves. <br /> The story has a prologue about what dances in Japan symbolized sociological, so it is not exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the US <br /> The film is light; you will laugh at some of the front gags. However, it is also dignity in a difficult way to describe. All the movie characters are taken seriously, as they are, and no they are diminishing because of their "flaws". <br /> I thought about getting social dance classes with some friends. It just so happened to a friend lent me the video about learning to dance. Does this synchronize or what? I think because now I'm really geeked giving it a try. <br /> Look at this wonderful family movie (little kids would not find it, but teen certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see the show it's time and again. <br /> would be a remake of our Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is.
