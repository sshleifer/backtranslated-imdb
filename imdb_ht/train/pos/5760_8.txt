My room-mate ordered this one off of the internet a while back and I finally got around watching it. It is gross. It's cheezy. It is very mute ... but it is also a lot of fun. I mean, this was the most fun we've watched a movie like this since "City of The Walking Dead" of that age. It was like being in the old Drive-in theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the movie dubbed movie films. This one has all the clicks and tricks from these films to roll in one, and it's clean because it is SUPPOSE to be like that. The cheater factor is high, the gore sinks and the laurels laugh! The effects go from the good sloppy, with the one where the guy gets torn in half with the one where a guy gets his heart pushed into his chest both were excellent! The act goes out of terrible actually very good. There are not many draws, just lots and lots of gore. This is one modeled after the zombie films from Italy and Spain I think, because they are delayed on the gross scenes forever, like this movie. If you like trumpet movies, Cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can do any wrong with watching this one. A good way to wasting a Friday night!
