This is one of those movies - like Dave, Indian dreamer and local hero - who holds a long time viewer interest. Lightweight movies rarely contain Oscars, but those who did the casting for Soapdish deserve one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what's coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various graphic aspects develop. True, the whole drama is melodrama; but this is totally tight for a movie that has a soap opera background. His favorite line from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can not I write sh * t like that?" I think it is unfortunate that television and web sites are insisting on all this necessary sanitation.
