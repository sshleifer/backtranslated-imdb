The beginning of this movie is a little clunky and also confusing, but sitting tight, because you are in for the ride in your life. The concept is compelling, and interesting devices used to tell the story in general. There are fine performances all around, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's were the best of cast-no surprise there. While Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance. Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a sixty-hearted feeling in view of the risks taken in the history of this story, but unlike the majority of film-educated films today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based on relationships rather than effect special or plug product. You will have great rewards for the time investing in this movie.
