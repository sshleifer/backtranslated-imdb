This is one of the best comedy comics / music "B" films that I saw (and since I'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now, I'm not an expert but I've seen all the movie These are well known out there). When there is a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time, the comedy usually interferes with the music bits, and often the music pieces interrupt the flow of comedic. Call me into a crazy type of mood but when I saw this on TCM Europe, I laughed loudly and fun! So who saved the laughter for me? Without a doubt, Mischa Auer rescued me some laugh laughing laughs, he even steals the finish, it was great! Speaking of that, I think why this movie works is because although L & H is a selling point (and why I've tuned to watch this one (and Hal Roach), I love them in the early hal Roach), this keeps them at a minimum and remains stringent on ADULT fare (by the 1930's, and not so far today today if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I only know her from W OZ and I liked him, and I also laughed loudly at her boy boy at the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "femme" girl in the 30's movies that actually turned me over (something to tell me she was a spitfire in real life); and the music numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), which blows me away that I use in this genre. I could go over and over, but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I've seen it on TCM Europe and will be recording it to look again with my wife on TCM USA. Good stuff!
