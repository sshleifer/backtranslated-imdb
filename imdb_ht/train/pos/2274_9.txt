Although I love Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spyware stories and I did not know this one. The only reason I watched was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw the "Breakfast Champions" and "Rwanda Hotel". But the movie brought me a nice surprise. Naturally Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and more focused on the moral question: by reading its anti-Semitic radio and secretive American message messages, it in fact contributes to the overall mood of German (and, as it later turned out, American) towards Jews or Hitler. Which brings more weight, service to his country or his unconscious anti-Semitism contribution? The diary is even more important as these words never speak, not just narratives. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open up, not even in his memory. The inner conflict in such a character is almost impossible to show - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. There are other points in it, such as the humor or the use of darkness in romantic clich√©s (like the White Christmas song), making it really different from American average movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood sports movies.
