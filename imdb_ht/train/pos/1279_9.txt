This film is a fun and absolutely sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photography including vivid colors and turned doctored settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first sample attempt. One warning, do not take the movie message seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and that's not a compliment). The message is somewhat stylized post-college, look neophyte in society. <br /> I enjoyed the basic draw line of a zinc editor 'Zine verbally rubbing the morocco in the 90's.
