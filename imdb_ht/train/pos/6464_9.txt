Wow I Loved This Movie! It is about normal life in a small village. On hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It is about everything everyone has encountered in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinions of others and 'what will be their neighbors think' more important than they follow their hearts. Do not let anyone's opinion stop you from filling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal, it could be my family. There are no great great, but everyone you fall in love with during the movie.
