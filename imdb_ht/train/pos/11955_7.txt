Allow yourself to be transported to a different, old school type storytelling. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The usual looking-type student with the help of nerdish glasses and outfits but still neglected to make the audience believe how master lord Hugh Jackman's master can be so beaten by it, given the King's background (do not worry, there is no crowd here ). There is no grand transformation for Johansson's character here, as it always plays the same character at all despite the script saying otherwise. You even forgive the apparent shortcoming of his character, continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer, simply because he is Jackman Hotman, who is worthwhile to see the essence of the Goutin Dude. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is that Allen's 70-year old is all over. He continues to tell his story about celluloid in the same way he still has; as if he had never been exposed to modern film-making, which is probably what makes it quiet, its simple appeal film. They never seem to target for a specific market; as if Allen makes the movie to taste it alone, whether the public likes it or not.
