I stumble across syndication this reunion show several years ago, and fell in love with her. It features Teo Leoni and Holland Taylor and keeps me laughing, one episode after the next. I guess he did not do it so great, and was canceled after a few seasons, but I believed he was a good run, and would suggest watching it ... if the opportunity came.
