There are many reasons to watch this film: to see the reality of smoking Latin America regarding kidnapping, corruption of the continental level, among the many realities that we live in. <br /> <br /> The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues to be an excellent actor and he continues this way. Dakota Fanning just 10 years ago, an excellent actress came and congratulated her. The rest of the film was in wonder, I have it in my collection. I hope to reach people in Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela, where we show our reality better with regard to delinquency, the traffic of drugs or political issues. There are some movies that play Venezuelan countries (for example, Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) should do more, as well as in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope he leaves in the band, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10
