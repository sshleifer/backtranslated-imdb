I just finished listening to the director's director for this movie, and I think a big thing I got from her that I agree with is that this movie, like The Insider's Man, is completely subjective. It comes from Pov Howard. So any review or try to contemplate a series of comments about it, as Ebert did, is really about Nolte's character actually. If you feel, as he did, the movie "does not work," then you're saying, I think, that Howard does not work. And, Frank, you might be good. Howard's reasoning and personality really would not stand up to mental health treatment and analysis. <br /> But hey, that's the nature of people.
