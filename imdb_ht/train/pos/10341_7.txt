A genuine screaming comedy movie in the 70s among this movie was a big hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared on the face of the earth. I'm still amazed at some comedy films that are a great release a week and then disappear: HIGH ANCESTI, DETECTIVE CHEAP, the little black beast, do not look now we're off at ........ ... and there is no profile all over today. NORMAN was comedy of the month of every time 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laughed at it and then never mentioned it ever again. Famous for shooting on video and film transfer, an experiment at the moment, NORMAN is a politically rugged belligerent bell to shine that Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today. If it was done in the first place there would be no complaint about its content and silhouettes either. It's very funny with YES very rude and hilariously all wrong. Just as it should. In fact, as a groovy movie 1976 and all these horror colors and clothes she actually works best today.
