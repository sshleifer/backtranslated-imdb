I should say this is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. I liked it first but really appreciated it on the second look, just a few weeks ago. I can see why end does like big business in the box office. Apparently, a lot loved this movie. A gorgeous color palette (person, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a great winner. The opening 3-4 minute scenes and "Scat," are excellent as their subsequent interludes with him. The "Southern" slug (voiced by John Leguizano), however, gives the main humor of the movie. It usually has something funny to say throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great movie character, literally, while Denis Leary is the wild-guy-turned-good Sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and beautiful color but a beautiful, sentimental story of how a little baby lens up a couple of tough characters. This is not cut with a lot of songs, either: one only short one and nothing offensive, the wise language. If the more animated movies were so good, I would have more.
