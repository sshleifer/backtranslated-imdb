John Waters has given us a really enjoyable movie. This certainly is not bloody moments of Waters-esque, but it is furious than its older culture, such as "Pink Flamingo". "Pecker" harkens back to the early stage of John's mainstay in that he recalls the viewer of the same type of humor that was evident in "Polyester". In general, a really fun comedy and some great moments!
