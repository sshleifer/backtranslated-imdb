Another Downey must-see! If you're a fan of obsess like me, you've seen this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life he just entered is the life he has left 26 years earlier. Alex is reincarnated at Louie Jeffries, a no-lover lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie died on one year anniversary when they were hit by a car. He asks to go back, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Entry Robert Downey Jr, a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughter. Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation. But if so, how often do you satisfy even soul life after life. I do not know the answer. But I know that you need to see this movie. It's a riot, and Downey looks so good at a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It just gets recyclable.
