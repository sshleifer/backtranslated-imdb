I'll keep this one quite short. I believe this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviews that have commented on the effect that it's wrong to write, inject, have a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it's not real to paint it in life. OK, so it can not be quite credible for its entire length, but this movie brings a message of hope that some others seemed to have missed. Hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that go into many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? Is it right, no! This movie brings a significant social message that cynics may be influenza, but which is however to be praised, rather than denigrating. I watched this movie with lots of fun at least eight times, each time having fun with every time and the feeling that perhaps the world could do better and not beyond saving (well by up to 2008 anyway ). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. It's pretty much perfect in my look. JMV
