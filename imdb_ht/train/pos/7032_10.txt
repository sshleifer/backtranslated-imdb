My school drama club will put this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope that we are as good as this! I watched this movie lately as the sort of "search" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I would just like to say, Vanessa Williams is the coolest! Wow! The casting for this movie was right-on (with one exception). Jason Alexander, or Mon, is there anything he can not do? She was the most beautiful Albert Peterson ever - I especially love all her comic facial expressions and dancing while "Put on a Happy Face!" It's so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from seductress secretary was totally credible. Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert's mother and George Wendt were superb as Mr. McAfee's (though I like Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version). Brigitta Dau split me up like Ursula Merkle; it really hammed it up! And Marc Kudisch was an awesome Conrad Birdie ... "Leave!" <br /> There was only one casting that I did not understand, and, as you will see in previous comments, many others didn not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean it's really nice and very talented, but ... it looks a bit too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm Deliram. <br /> <br /> Well well anyways, I highly recommend this movie. It will let you smile! <br /> <br />
