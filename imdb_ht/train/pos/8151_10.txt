I saw it in a sharp film theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban. The show I went to had a semblance of African-Americans, and he made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social one about the state of race relations in this country. Basically, as white they were laughing laughter or laughing nervously in the funny bits - and there are so many! - because they should be "polluted in black", while the blacks also remain very silent because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the white. I, on the other hand, were Asian (and so belonging to groups), had a great time watching this saturated rap and ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophy. Throw is the talent and make of great work become the characters described. These songs are too funny to believe. This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come together, including "A Mighty Wind"
