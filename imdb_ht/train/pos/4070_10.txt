I know Anime. I've been in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew that Dragonball Z was the same. And just for you to know I'm not bragging about me, let me say this: from all the anime I've seen, Castle in the sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious to say Spirited Away is the best, but I really agree. Most people only know that movie because it is an Acedmy award; This is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Castle in the sky to those who would only ever see Spirited Away, and agree that the two letters are superior to the three. Personally, I would never think anything could compare with Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the sky. I always think that the previous is the best of the two, but the Sky Castle is easy on par with it; In many ways, Castle has important elements that Mononoke missed. In any case, if you only saw Spirited Away, and think that Miyazaki's best movie is, be prepared to have your earth shake.
