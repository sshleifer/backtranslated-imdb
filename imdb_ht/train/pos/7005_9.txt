When his DVD was released I came to market and bought it. And I think my money was as straightforward as I expected before buying it. Awesome movie which else I can say for Will Smith, He was an awesome actor as always in movies or serious action. Always provide a braking performance record. I think this is the movie after August Rush that makes someone cry while watching it. The way the director described the story was really scary. His previous life and his new life in films have correctly elaborated the audience. Even I could not find any fault in the story or how to shoot it. I think its DVD should be a home because it will really be a wonderful thing for your collection. It is not the movie that needs pop-corn for fun, this is the movie that leaves the audience learning a lesson. now what the lesson you can see that while watching. And I advise those who are critical movie please see this if you could find any critics on this movie, please talk with me.
