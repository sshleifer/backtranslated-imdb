This is an EXCELLENT example of early talented Bette Davis. Production is higher than average for 1936 delays. I can not understand why the owners of this movie right do not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE PLEASE drop it. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen it in more than thirty years, on TV, but remember it well.
