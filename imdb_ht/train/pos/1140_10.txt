I was a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers moving to the forefront, I had to take the movie in the shelf and watch it. Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me? Sally Gardens and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I will never watch the soap opera day, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The act is second to anything for a comedy and writing so smart. I highly recommend that you look this if you have not already. You'll get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher ... in the name of a few ... all giving splendid performance.
