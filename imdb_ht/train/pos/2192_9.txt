Dan Katzir has produced a wonderful movie that takes us on a roller coaster ride into a real romance set in the issues surrounding modern Israel. For anyone who has ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, insecurity and grief that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that has come with the difficult times of Israel at this time just serves to intensify the feeling. Subsequently, you are drawn to Dan's combat, and you can not fail to be deeply moved. <br /> <br /> You can not write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of the Desperate Dan, hacking relationships with Iris, and the facts of a state of turmoil make this eminently observable. If you have an ounce passion, and have ever been in love, watch this movie.
