Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released for years later), this is worth the look. The role of De Niro is not great, but fun as one of two friends who first try to prevent another wedding friend just later chasing him down to his strength in it. Any Hard Hardcore Niro fan will get a kick from an early performance by arguably the best actor today.
