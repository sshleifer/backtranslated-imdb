Are you a giraffe? ... asked Jan Nadia, and he, sure to respond well, replied: yes. In this way, the start of communication between a man and a woman who does not know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts of "Birthday Girl". A movie that I heard many times, but I dare not see ... until two hours of writing this. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that makes me fall in love, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (In addition it is nice and smart) that I has ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely person and similar routine for a wife of the Internet. The woman she finds out of Russia. It seems to be that delicate women, normal, no more. One day, his birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. The man begins to discover some things. From here, it will not be to be the lonely man and routine that has always been. Many of us will think that this film is just one regular and a scheme exploited. Many of us will think that the action and emotions are sure and do not novels. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performance and an imaginative draw that I have never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller and earning some funny is an excellent natural film and a lot of propose for the films of its kind. "Birthday Girl" has certain beauty and knowledge of its stage, but at the same time, certain touch touch and make it so deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end is totally unsatisfactory. And I do not regret to say that this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if there is any.
