I like this movie! I presently see how I'm a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed myself. The action takes to run the beginning of the movie and just keep going away! This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not pass quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed out this) and there is no music number. It is adventure structure structure. I enjoy it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, be young or old.
