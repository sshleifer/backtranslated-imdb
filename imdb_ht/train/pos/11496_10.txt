Enjoy this movie too. See it when she first showed i8n Germany in a small independent movie theater in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. Erotic in the movie hit the spectators and discussions with the producer Moritz Boerner and directors have always been outlined. In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think it was an independent movie. <br /> It does not exist many copies of that movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before it became a sort of therapist. For those who want to see that movie again, you might find it on homepage that is not easy to search for but it is possible.
