I saw the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and girl friend. So I had views from every kind of direction. Mostly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only apparent actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think he played his role well, though the script is inappropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just did not have complex roles. I applaud Puya entering movie business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. The woman liked the movie, though, and I think that there might have been chords played and that I had no ears for. If the movie tried to present uncommon sexual behavior and the consequences of Romania today, then it failed miserably. There was no consequence. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, refreshing draw. <br /> I have no idea why he has received all those BAFTA awards. In my book, he should have gotten the "best chance next time" award. (Bafta = Good luck in Romanian).
