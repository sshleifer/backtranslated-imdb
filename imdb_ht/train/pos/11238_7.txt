Hidden Frontier is a fan show show, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta-keypad. It has some characters from official Star Trek show, but most of them are the original show. The show takes place on the base of the Deep Space 12 stars and on several space ships, giving it the opportunity to show the officials do not have. Characters have the opportunity of a rising of the hierarchy, which character of show and one pirate does not have. The show has good computer animation in spaces, but the act takes place in front of the green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do fine. Episodes are driving characters and characters developed over many episodes. This is a bit more like in Babylon 5, than most official Star Trek show. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that same official series has shrunk to using. All in all I enjoyed watching it.
