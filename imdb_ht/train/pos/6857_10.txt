"Dressing to Kill" is one of the best stairs ever made. His behavior with sex and violence makes this an adult movie. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera telling a story. He directed many scenes without dialogue, and said much of his story, prohibited from his visual usage, and Pino Donnagio's brilliant notes. Movies of Panavision, the movie must be seen in panoramic, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story. Cut, on video, "dressing to kill", is barely the same movie. Solid performance from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest movie score ever written, making the "dressing to kill" a must see.
