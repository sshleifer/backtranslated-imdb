Everyone received bills, including Christopher Walken. In Vietnam, a group of soldiers found that the war was over and heading back home when they saw a lot of people in POWs, including Christopher Walken. After an upset Max 3 (!) Fight Thunderdome, with a short time later. Walken and some Colombian guys split a dollar bill promising something else. <br /> <br /> The present cuttings (1991), and Colombian guys who led a revolution against El Presidente. It's the first success, but after El Presidane threatened to break up with a tank, he was forced to surrender and shot at the top of the live TV. This is shown in complete detail as a news flash on American television, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though it was not actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and Gun down thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a stupid monument movie, but for all it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those cinemas where the logic gives a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a pilot fighter from the top from another plan without suffering depression, or even break a window?

Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how often you can attach the camera crew as well.
