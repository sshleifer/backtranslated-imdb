If you lived in the 60s, this movie can be in painful times and other times quite happy. It's all there but the small print of the counter culture culture overseas at the time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out: "Do not talk too early for the wheel still in turn, for the times are a changin". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and streaming it at the time, which alone has played a tremendous hand in the evolution of intelligence, influencing engineers, scientists and assist in the super development of related activities and computer. A greeting to the filmmakers from one who was there - you captured the era much better than I had before seen.
