A beautiful postcard in New York. My dear things could look like this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid bathroom humor joke displayed. He never did. My teen likes it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and enjoy something. This movie tells a story that felt comfortable but it's not old or done. The finish came with a twist that we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have to leave a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one is made. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
