Corbin Bernsen provides a terrific and intense performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who has been obsessed with perfection. When she discovered that lovely blonde babe succumbed to his wife was cheating on her and starring at IRS hounding her on tax issues, Feinstone slammed under the pressure and went to violence around the bend. Director of Brian Yuzna, working in a black, witty, and demarcated script, featured by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli, and Charles Finch, exposed the butcher's neurosis and eucalyptic psychosis under the clean manicured surfaces of wealthy Rich Americans with delicious glee bad. In addition, Yuzna plus spices go up the grisly on with a tightly twisted sense of black humor pitch pitch. Bernsen positively shines as Dr. Feinstone; It experts project a really unnerving hidden creepiness that's right under Feinstone's cooling defomens and ensures veneer. Throw in support as well as excellent: Linda Hoffman as Bitchy Feinstone, unpleasant wife Brooke, Earl Boen as smarmy, meddlesome IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as Jessica Festivals, Patty Games as Perky Assistant Karen, John Hoag as Jolly Manager Candy, Virgina Keehne as sweet, gawky teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as Good, No-nonsense Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs' equally clever Sunshine detective partner, Michael Stadvec as Madame Cheese fragrant mats, and Mark Ruffalo as on the Steve Landers sleazeball. The first make-up f / x rates are every bit as gory, gross and upsetting as they should. The community polished by Levie Isaaks has a lot of cool camera angles tilted with a few delicious zoom-in shut-ups. Alan Mustache around the Scout Score also hit the body-pull. An enjoyable treat of deformation.
