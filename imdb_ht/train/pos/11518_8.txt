You can do a lot with a little cash. Blair Witch has proven that. This movie supports it. It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. However, because she has Jan Cleese as Sherlock Holmes she managed to be hilarious even on a budget that could not afford a shoestring. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as sincere, bumbling Watson, his dimensions, and inform Cleose's clutter-quicker understanding. If you ever run across the movie to watch it for an original or two street.
