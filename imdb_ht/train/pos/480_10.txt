The main aspect of this movie that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess player. So many people have seen this movie and just do not get it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie I took on a private trip that drifted me. I will try to explain this without any crowd, but be warned, I talk about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Warning! <br /> <br /> It is a life of "great movements" against "small movements". She chooses Natalia to be his Queen, and she and her behave as her Aunt first described the king and the queen and his movements when he introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. When asked a question, he recovered from the past as if reviewing past moves. (Flatbacks are very well lit, by the way.) The flashbacks are very interesting as well, giving not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. It's stunning. <br /> <br /> Various characters become either helpers or his enemies, plains, bishops and riders, their actions enlighten you as who in their side are on. Even the assignments of a stage are essential to understand what is happening. I will not comment further on what happens to Luhzin's character, but I hope this will grow what actually happens in the end. is still working on many levels, which is why I endorse it. It was a treat and a happy look. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie I would recommend a movie called Cool. The only way for these films seems to be the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
