*** Can not consider this to have a spoiler, but I would rather be cautious than negligent *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her and my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. <br /> For little act Ilene Woods made in her life, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very appealing; very credible. The music really fit the movie perfectly. The act was great; love smiling !! You really "hate" Lady Tremain and step-sisters; they were just awful. The cartoonists show the spoiled behavior very well. This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are in love story. My daughter saw the film about 25 times and still gets excited at the end.
