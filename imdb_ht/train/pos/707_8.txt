There must be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought that this one was very well done. The direction and cinematography were engaged without a distraction. Angle, setting, and lighting used successfully to create the nightmare world in which the main character was blocked. Many haunting and memorable images from the movie movie in your head long after it's over (always a sign of a good director).
