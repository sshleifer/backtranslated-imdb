When a small hobbit called Frodo Baggins inherited a magic ring from his uncle, Gandalf wizard investigated and discovered that the ring is an ancient creation of a bad black lord. The ring should be completed back in his hand, he will regain his power and destroy the Earth's Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out on a quest to destroy the ring and a mighty warrior. This is an underlying adaptation of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and beautifully animated film. <br /> <br /> The superbly animated animation and rotoscope, which is drawn to live action. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the budget given to him. The film also features a grand music note by Leonard Rosenman who fits every scene. There are some traps drawn with the script, but this must have been undertaken, considering the original deal made trilogy in the book two films, many have been stacked in the first one. My bigger bigger is some of the character drawing, Samwise was a bit too jumpy, while the other hobbits act completely normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually a bit more useful in the draw. The rotoscoped Orcs are more funny than scary, while the ringwraiths are strange and nightmare. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the wizard sorcerer Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. In general, I think a little more money and best writers would do this a lot of justice, but there is something good about it. Ralph Bakshi has made a vigorous effort to make the screen adaptation of these classic stories. The movie suffered terribly from being covered by the live action films, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
