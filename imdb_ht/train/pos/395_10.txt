Visually stunning and full of Eastern philosophy, this amazing martial arts art is brought to by Master Director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best movies Hong Kong movies produced. Special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but it's a refreshing change in films that treat their hearings as if they were morons. If thinking is not strong, however, this can not be your movie. Perhaps you should go see the latest in the Hollywood studio club club, but if you're looking for something more, it's where you'll find it.
