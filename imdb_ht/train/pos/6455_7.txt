I drew this movie at the moment I saw a preview of it on Oscar Night. When I read about Pollak's house, I was hooked. We are Americans suckers for a kid recombe. <br /> I understand this movie was a great draw in Sweden. As a very provincial Indian I can only speculate on the reasons. Perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the Lena character does at the start of the movie and other social commentary but maybe it is because of the central message that I believe has the same appeal throughout the affluent society. /> The message in this movie for me is the same as the Titanic movie. Life is short and as far as anyone really knows it's all we have. It can take away at any time. So is not it a pity that we spend a lot of time hidden behind the walls to separate us from others because we are so afraid of being hurt? Tear down the walls is painful, but I feel lively on the other side of those miserable walls. Feeling in vain is a risk. Provide and you will receive. So start living right now. Many people are criticizing this film for lack of character and other defects. I say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Finding a grip as it is a parable, a fable for glorifying tourists who are rich in material but with the souls of poverty abused. So join a chorus or band or help build homes or distribute foods for those less likely than you. Spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and communicate with your fellow. Write a check is not enough. We are a social species in the way. Even humble of fellow human or human can affect you in the way you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Rugged individuality has its place, but it is sub-rated.
