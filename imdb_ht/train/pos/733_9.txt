How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. He reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians dying in fire while being useless to live forever. I paraphrase here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL said the story of a group of children disenfranchised fighting oppressive high school administration. It's very funny thing, but there's an optimistic about it that is refreshing (though they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become anxiety for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule in an era when people still believe that music counts and that it can make a difference in society larger. It's all children who know authority does not have the correct answer. Instead, stone and scroll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> But most importantly, this is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Take any of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this was not what high school life was like in the sixties, then it would be.
