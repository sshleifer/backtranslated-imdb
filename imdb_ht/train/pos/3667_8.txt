North Hollywood is a satirical look at the time of Canadian film history when the Canadian government offers great tax breaks made in Canada. Most of the time he was treated as a tax shelter or cheap way to get American movie made. For example, the porky comes out of it. Anyways Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a Canadian beloved. However, in order to get the money he needs a star American name. He becomes a loose cannon and he learns to be compromised at the point where the film does not look like the original book was based. He plays well in Canada but can not understand outside the Great White North. Americans are thinking we're satirizing ourselves, but they will miss the point that we're actually satirizing them. For Canadian 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
