So, Mary and Rhoda are age - who does not have? I was a teenager when Mary first, and a "young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was nice to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the movie did not support the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make this a proper paycheck. Example: The producer who works Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series of "old people." Is not that typical of the present-Hollywood-style mentality and film "countertop weight?" This may not be Mary Tyler Moore's show of its best - but it's a nice look look back at one of the best shows we've grown up with in the 70s.
