This movie is Sterling example of the state of erotic B-cinema: bad porn movies without sex in hardcore. The plot of this one is not so bad as things go away; she involves a woman lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent in killing his wife. The rest of the movie, however, left something to be desired. Bad acting, bad guys, bad guys, bad sex, bad movies, bad sounds and sex gender sex. Filmists should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. They do not even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How dumb is that?
