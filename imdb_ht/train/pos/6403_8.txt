The Honorable Honors feature Cuba Buy Jr., of which is probably the best performance it's to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of immense courage and courage. He is a poor dirt farm in the south, who wants to become a marine diver - but he has trouble because of his race. The head of the school diving, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racial redneck that is however growing up to respecting Brashear. The film is about how Brashear agrees to almost impossible to insure, not once, but twice. The performances are what makes this movie special. Strong is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, provides an immense performance - it's best to work dramatically over the years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as younger DeNiro wife. The movie lays on the patriotism a little too strong (though there is no place near the level it was in the Patriot), and a few of the characters are just a bad dimension (Mr. Pappy Hal Holbrook's just wrong), but the movie is a rarity among today's films. It's uplifting and uncynical. A wonderful movie.
