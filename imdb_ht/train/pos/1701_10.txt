This is the movie a man thinks the thought. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy this British humor, you might just turn into a classic classic for you as he has for my wife and I - from the "voice" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as martians in the populace The simplest of this Big Pea is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick idea to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie.
