The first time I saw Buster Keaton's first feature, I admire I loved it a lot and only wanted to stumble across it this year. The Rohauer phase at the start warns that Three Nile One Nitrate Printing has been rediscovered and saved in 1954 just in time before combustion, with many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together separated. So it's looking at rock in place, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on its intolerance to invent and comic from the start to the finish: In the Stone Age and Baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and Goodie Buster to riding a brontosaurus pet; At the Roman Roman Buster rides a chariot and locks and suits for sledging, there are no signs of parking in Latin; At this technological age of car Needed and greed speeds very well fall into bits in the first cap. Both her and the Beery after the girl at age, a tussle never ends. Favorite bit: As the caveman it gets hit behind on a cliff edge but still boasts a camera - a second amazing or two! <br /> <br /> Great stuff, reafirm my love in silent movie comedy.
