Despite reading the "initial commentary" from someone who is curiously not the movie - (WHO NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NUMBER OF THE FIRST NUMBER on the list?) It was very nice to remember that virtually everyone else liked it! Obviously the Church wanted to control certain points and show Joseph Smith's prophet in a positive way ~ that the whole idea. And in fact, these points were very effective. We already know Joseph Smith was human ... but despite that, AK all the terrible adversities on the opponent, he showed just how he could fulfill a remarkable work, given by God. I would recommend it to anybody!
