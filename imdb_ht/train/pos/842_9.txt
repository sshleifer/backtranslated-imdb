The Matador is a witty melodrama, humorous and thrilling darkness that walks higher mediocre thanks to extremely engaging and reliable performance from Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and Greg Kinnear's still-faithful Its best role here since playing Jack Nicholson's gay neighbors in its kind. A big plus goes to the writing as well. Cleverly and occasionally extremely nasty dialogue is being delivered and gusto by the Brosnan and the gilding building slowly between the two different people is completely convincing all the way. The story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it will go next. <br /> Nice artistic touch from the director as good for the use of music, clever correction and a bit sincerely authority at times putting a nice tone for the movie and for a long period of time you do not quite know how to label the movie. But this also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the corner of his chair.
