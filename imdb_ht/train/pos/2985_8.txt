The whole point in making this movie, one of the earliest and most popular international color releases in Cinemas operations, has made it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeds admirable in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two exotic lovers of ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 book over 40 tenor and soprano and equipment in the vocal song of the glorious music. So, the visual substitution of the lovely directors (a young Loren, beautiful Della Marra, and a Mademoiselle Slinky Ms.) makes the story more credible, giving people not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance of They were wooed in beautiful enigmas that otherwise could not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing that when I was in junior high school and it certainly got my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not quite aware. I still consider this movie tender and I would highly recommend it to those who would appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was an exceptional as Radames, and unfortunately for hearings did not appear in any other movie.
