The cure is an amazing movie ... so thriller and just so real! I was lucky enough to catch a screening of the 'Cure' at her Premiere in NYC and it completely blew me away! I also heard he won an award from this particular festival, and he definitely deserves it. The first thing that hit me was movies. Eric Giovon did an amazing job. The shooting style of the half love scenes of the movie was amazing. A love scene was needed in this movie, and Jafri got the point across but also kept the tastier scenes. Giovon and Jafri make an excellent creative team and should definitely work together on future projects. Judge Maier's statement was so sure but attentive to wrenching, and made me feel that the main character felt. I'm a very tough critic but I have to say healing is one of my favorite films .. Just love it! If you have not seen it again, check it out!
