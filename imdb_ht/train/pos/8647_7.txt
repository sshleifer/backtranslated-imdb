If this is supposed to be a portrayal of the American American killer, it comes across as unpleasant average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels across California's America's most famous murderer documentary, unaware that one of his white trash trailers he travels [Pitt] is a serious assassin himself. <br /> Rather predictable at all, this has its moment of action and Pitt and Lewis show their roles well, but I would not have to bother it anymore.
