in a non-conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a toddler, and I just recently remembered it, and she thought to look at her. While many of the details are not clear in my mind, the general feeling that the movie gave me was stuck with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that children can handle mature and sometimes violent terms, then I highly recommend this movie. He taught me so much about life and death, and he brought in many emotions. To this day, she remains one of my favorite films.
