An unprecedented original printing of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress, and has been featured in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I found online, the original has all in nastiest dialogue and innuendos intact; They were later removed or completely re-shot by the studio before the initial release, in order to pass New York State sensory. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we're really lucky, it will include comparing the two versions. Note that the original version of the version was completed on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck regulation!
