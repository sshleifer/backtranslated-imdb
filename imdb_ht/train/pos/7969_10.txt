Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. Y'know part where shadow falls down hole ... thing, I * called *, considering I was only six, I cried out! It takes a lot to cry! Dogs and cats are excellent trained. A beautiful family movie, * not * for completely stubborn non-inflated or animal-harm but could be for soft-like-crap a.k. people like me. <br /> A good movie in general, 10/10!
