I like Horror occult, with the great British Hammer Studios, which has delivered one of the biggest films and the "Devil Rising Out" (1968), proving to be more than capable in this field of horror. This tenth occult episode of the short-run TV-run "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is indeed a creepy entrance of the series. Director of Don Sharp, who was already wealthy and "Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and the addition of "Fu Machu" movie starring Christopher Lee, is doubtful one of the best-known names among the HHH directors, and is also rescued here. Antique Dealer Michael (Ray Lons) is broken on a mysterious old glass insulator. The scrying glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil-worshiping cult, who wants to use it for satanic values. When she shakes a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who must be sacrificed by the cult, Michael joins in deeper issues with the cult and disaster leader (John Carson) ... While this is not One of my favorite episodes in "Hammer House of Horror" (one of the clearest ones is the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Cry"), it is a very creepy and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists, and remains suspense and unearthly throughout the movie. Bloody rays make a good lead, young Rosalyn Landor is convinced as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is really creeping as the leader of the Satanists. In general, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting story with Creepy HHH, and my fans Hammer should not miss it.
