Full disclosure: I'm a cynical. I like to finish my sadness and my hip hop. I did not cry when the mother of the bamboo shot. The new Will Smith film soon looks like a desperate prayer for an Oscar. Basically I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> So why does my world like "10 items or less?" Perhaps it was the double espresso I dropped before the show. Or (more likely) maybe it was that even most boulders of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> And sweet it is. From this moment, "It" meets "red" (an event that is far from Nora Ephron "meet beautiful") is the look of taking on an intimate journey with two strangers learn to care about where their lives are headed. (Aided very well by Phedon Papamichael's virtual movie cameras work.) The main argument about the movie is that it's too far away. Is the movie far off? I do not know. You tell me. I have always been to meet Adrian Brody in the market. (However, not for lack of trying). Do I enjoy considering the adventures that might have happened to this important event to take place? Turn right I do. . .what is the most reviewed review of "10 articles or less" falls short. . . They do not take into account that even our cynically has imagination. And heck, sometimes it's worth the cost of admission to vicariously living, 82 minutes at a time.
