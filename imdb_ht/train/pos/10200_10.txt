Everything I hear about is how bad the animation does. It may not be up to and so everyone is expected, but look at it this way. Would you expect perfection of hell? It was my belief that the animation was made dry and frustrating on purpose. It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever find. I hope for a very late end. If we want live action, I think we can better deal with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death would transfer good to film. But that's how it may be, My own belief is personal that all the naysayers on this movie are DEAD wrong. No pun intended.
