This movie is practically impossible to describe. The alternate title "does not look" is a lot more descriptive. Like most Japanese movies, the story is not as straightforward as American. The story revolves around a film director of a story about a deserter ww2. The series is haunted (?) Not an actress who died (?) During filming on a TV show back in the 60s. The director is the only one who has seen this show. If you've seen Ringu (director of Hideo Nakata is the same) and love her, you will love ghost actress. i loved ghost actress much more than ringu. a really scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
