I stumbled upon this movie when I was be'ing Caesars Palace things, as I am romantic and rich Vegas story as the latest in the original luxury resorts still stand in good condition (unless you count Bally, the original MGM Grand) . In this regard, this film delivers full strength. You will be given a grand tour of the Caesars property, which in spite of all the renovations and additions made over the 40 years it has opened, looks alarmingly the same way. As a general movie, the plot is a bit difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the lurid correction. When I say horrendous, I do not use this word lightly. There are a lot of tight, second-long fragments of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the character Robert Drivas will have a conversation with his father about how much he has grown up, and without any explanation, he ( Drivas) goes (in those infamous snippets) from being himself, in a baby, to a little boy, and then return to his head while talking back to his father's mind. (This does not give away any details of the scheme; if anything, one can be prepared for it and perhaps they will not be as flabbergasted as I was by the correction.) The movie was quite good, and it has a good message about the differences inherent between a father and his son most guys could be related in some form or fashion.
