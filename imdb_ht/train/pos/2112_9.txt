In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (like Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; there, he bickers and co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not get along in the job because each was dropped in love with an unseen papers. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars at the inevitable is satisfying adventure. <br /> <br /> Even better is a sub-draw including Frank Morgan's homeowners (like Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife has an affair. Employing a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms his wife in 22 years having sex with one of her youngest employees. Morgan, painfully realized, "It just did not want to grow old with me," and the characters supported are what keeps this movie out of getting old. Shop in the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
