One of the best films of all time. Changes from Black and White to the Sky and Earth Sequence were exceliently direct. The plot is very clever, the full movie of your sheet overwhelmed by all of the human emotions, and although a war film does not discriminate. I had to watch this film more times than any other, and I never tired of it. It's a movie that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs about what's happening after our crushing.
