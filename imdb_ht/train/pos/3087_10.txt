Six Degrees are a wonderful show! I've watched the whole online season since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2: '(and to head it all off, ABC has now taken it online, so it's not can be seen online again. Why ABC creates such a wonderful show, with a great storyline and great characters just pulling it into the air without ever finishing the story. It seems it is let our imagination know what's going on than all of us connect characters. Even if I feel that ABC could at least put the show online for viewers who have admitted it while they continue to cover reality TV shows.Six Degree we will miss you.
