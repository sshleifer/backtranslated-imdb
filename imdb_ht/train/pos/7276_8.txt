When I rented this movie I thought I was going to see a movie horror. However, there is little horror in this typical typical mystery-drama directed by Strange James T. Flocker. Nice-looking Matt Boston brings the picture with its fine performance and the unusual typical atmosphere of Flocker's movies is all-present.
