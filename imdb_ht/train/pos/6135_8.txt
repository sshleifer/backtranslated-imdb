Bed & Broomsticks is another of Disney's chiefs. He was filmed and the animation sequence with actors and actresses communicated with their animation. (They used a similar concept in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared from the sidewalk art.) I mainly mentioned this movie in the eyes of children because I never saw it in years. Back then, it was one of my favorite films. It was magical and mysterious, and the recent scenes (the conflict began with weapons of ghostly walking in battle) was my favorites. There was also a lot of suspended animation used with the spells (ie, those turning in rabbits), which can be a little dating and funny now. (Also, I believe that the movie begins slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a fun movie and it's easy for kids to put themselves in place of the kids in the movie. It's an imaginative film that is sadly largely-forgotten today.
