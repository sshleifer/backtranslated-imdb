I was expecting this movie for a 1930-la-novel romance. Boy meets the girls, they fall in love, boy lost girl, boy wins him back to the end. It was not like this all. Clark Gable plays as artist Eddie with his usual charisma and malignant eyebrows. It is hidden from the cops when it bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow) in the apartment, found it covered in bubbles in the tub, no less. Instant chemistry.He plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for long. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production codes! When a blackmail work goes wrong and Ruby ends in a riding house for "troubled girl", it is miserable and, thanks to his roommate racking, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for it. Harlow plays hard-noz, fast Ruby's perfectly. It never lets Gable find all the good lines! There is a scene specially moving and playing the "songs" on the piano that acts perfectly. The last fifteen minutes made me cry every time. A really sweet romance.
