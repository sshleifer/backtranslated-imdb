When I flicking through the TV Guide, and came across "Twisted Desire" on the movie section, I read his description. Three words caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I found her role in "Sabrina: The Adult Witch" absolutely vile, I hate these kinds of programs, so I just thought she was going to be a boring bun old, love story starting to read ... Little I knew. <br /> It was finally started on the TV, I had my bucket ready in case I was ticking about it in cheesiness or soppiness, you know what I mean. At first, you think it's just a nice, ordinary girl who's in love, but it means parents. Then when you get out of her boyfriend to manipulate her to kill her parents, so she could with her true love, or like "whoa". You just do not expect this sort of role for that sort of actress. She played her role very well in my opinion, I never expected to be able to act like a bitch, and voila, she did it perfectly! Her congratulations, the movie was very good, I would definitely look it again and recommend it to others.
