The war between the United States was perhaps the worst hour of America's history; a war that broke out against brothers and families against family and branding brands that even today have not yet recovered, and in all probability never will. And, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance it is the personal disorder behind the major conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involved. It is the human element that makes the context necessary to give it perspective, which is what Ang Lee's director gives to `Ride with the Devil, 'a Civil War drama in which it focuses on the personal travails of the illustrious War of himself, and along the way managed to include a test of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war, the infamous attack on Lawrence, Kansas, by Quantrill and his adventurer, which he succeeded in presenting assets objectively from the point-two -View Confederation. In 1863, the influence of the Union in the State of Kansas, and even across the border of Missouri, the Lifetime Confederate people find it increasingly difficult to maintain their control over North, especially without the help of what could be considered any 'regular' Confederate troops. But when things really start to heat in their own city, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) form their own band and join the fray, making damage to the Union cause where possible. Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like to kill; but they stand up for what they believe to be good. There are others, however, even among their own, people like the young Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express Their own violent nature of unnecessary brutality, perpetrates in many cases against innocent victims. So for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many just like them, it becomes a time of loyalty and moral judgment will be seriously tested; a time during which souls are tempered in blood. And they will have to ride with the devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds. Like all of its films, Ang Lee's director approaches her story to an incredible, yet subtle, quiz in the traditions, cultural aspect and moral attitudes of people and times she is described. And in doing so, Lee gives his audience and at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the current story and finally offers, perhaps a deeper hand in motivation that pushes his character and drama into their place engage. If tradition and custom are the relationship between a father and his daughter ('Eat Drink Woman Man'), the distinction of distinction (meaning and sensitivity), the honor and the code by which a live warrior and dead (`` Tiger Tiger, Hidden Dragon ') or the moral ambiguities promoted by a lack of all the above (`The Storm Ice'), Lee enphiates his films and insights into the human condition that takes them to the highest level where. This movie is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story with the help of imaginative movies (in this film, by Frederick Elmes, who also made the 'glittering storm' glitter), which under his direction is not There is nothing less than visual poetry. It's that special Lee touches, and he adds a sensitive, meaningful reflection to whatever story he says, which is one of the elements that makes his movie memorable. <br /> <br /> As Jake, Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the movie that contrasts so effectively with the maturity it translates later on as the story develops, and her character along with it. Most importantly, Maguire is convincing and believing to respond to the events unfolding around him, adding to the credibility of the film in general and ensuring realism in the presentation: His stoic acceptance of death and the news of these ' murdered 'in the various skirmishes and battles; The moral of the ownership of whom it complies is compliant, even in these troubled times; The betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and loyalty with the belief that he and his companions stay stuck occasionally. It is all that Maguire achieved in its performance, and it is no small achievement. It is, however, the kind of study, understated performance that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; Work as this is worthy of reputation, and should be recognized. <br /> <br /> Skeet Ulrich is effective, as well as Jack Bull, and Jewel (her first motion picture) turned into an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley. It is Jeffrey Wright, however, who stands out as a remarkable support role as Daniel Holt, as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a Christopher Walken crisis-like threat to his role in Pitt. Also, in the amount of money in a cameras role (one scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves an unforgettable impression with very small screen times. James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), Jan Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Madam Chiles). The Civil War will be forever an open wound on the nation; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will be in the target cycles of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films such as 'ride with the Devil' that will ultimately help to close the shock and promote healing. In light of recent events, it is something that is seriously needed, worldwide. Film is a powerful means; It may be as fun as fun, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, such as Ang Lee, will embrace and promote a sense of unity in the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
