The flock is unjustly maligned as a smaller "Se7en" ripple. There is really no reason to compare the two, except perhaps for the same landscape in the final confrontation. <br /> Now that's this way I'll go into why the sheep is very interesting in some respects. Especially it's a piece of drama rather than a thriller completely blowing on a very vigilant social worker who delivers sexual offenders. In the very beginning you can clearly see his work got the best of him. Evident in her first stage scene in interviewing a offender and hitting her in and second when a woman tries to pick her up, and all she can think of are her standard questions from her questionnaire. <br /> Managing is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his job is not unlike that of a police officer, he carries a weapon and constantly checks journal and official law enforcement and information if some of his "sheep" may be responsible for a sexual offense. It is also someone who has lost all the happiness of living and relief only to seem out of his own precisely justice vigilante on his sheep. Twice you see her smile, once she's exquisite to treat her partner briskly to the other after she's beating up a member of her flock. As a flick of films, the flock is not as successful. A bit confusing and some disappointing holes that have a number of hit pieces hit. <br /> <br /> Overall the sheep is a solid drama about a man doing a disgusting job and at the end he worked hard to keep in swallowing by the abyss she surrounded herself in. Living in a very sick place and the other can distance itself from the happier worst of that person. The stick gets to this point nicely.
