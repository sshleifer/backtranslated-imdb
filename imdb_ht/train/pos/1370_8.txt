I remember seeing this year ago when it first came out and I was floating by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was very good too. For anyone who has spent too much time in the nightclub / after-hour scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, especially funny, and Parker Posey definitely blazes her talented way of this indie gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the Diaz character (remind me of all the DJs I've ever known). And many other movies can take a sign from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without boring and bland about it. Babaganoosh!
