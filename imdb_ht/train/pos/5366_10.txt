I sit here Nov 2006 and I still can not help diverting on this movie. Arnold's best movies came in a span of 4-5 years. Run Man, Predator, and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. Rubbing a Material Covered by Arnold in this movie will make you laugh at more than one occasion. I get to act in this amazing movie quite the case of Predator and Totall Recall. They performed a great job in trying to make the futuristic scene as it is supposed to take place in 2017, but you can not help but snicker in the 80's hair style haircuts about the men and women in the crowd with the normal TV monitors in the Running Man studio that we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and the HDTV. Also the computer graphics of the game "Intro Man" Runs would not seem like that in 2017. But the storyline is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie I wanted to get up and not care about the finish that is something I do often with today's movie. I really think that Arnold's act is better than she's giving credit. Now I would not elect his governor but this California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic "stalkers" as well and I get the producers by trying overkill the battle scene. When the Stalker died ... he died. It does not go for about 20 minutes each. The scenes are quick and fun stalkers but do not try and overplay it. I give this movie a 10/10 and this comes from someone who does not enjoy a lot of movies these days. If you find the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphic shows that you would see in 2006 are not relevant or unnecessary.
