What is most disturbing about this movie is not the school killing sprees like the one show actually happen, but the truth is being carried out by adolescents like Cal and Andrew ... normal and normal families. Using a camera technique made in a witch blair, Ben Coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with high school, although we have never said exactly what is behind these issues. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Part of you just do not believe they will ever carry out the very well-known massacre out on Zero Day. Scenes of camera surveillance at the school during the shooting were all the most powerful for this reason. You can not believe it really happened, and that it really happened. But the camera holder also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie, a brilliant idea to give the subject.
