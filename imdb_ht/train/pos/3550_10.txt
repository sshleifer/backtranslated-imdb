This is what the genre of music has to do in. Humor, talent, romance, and action all roll into one. Frank Sinatra was beautiful. There is nothing else to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, has done a great job of winning the hearts of her and painting it in Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing adding to his character. The ladies in the movie were fine, but the guys in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> It's a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch and enjoy!
