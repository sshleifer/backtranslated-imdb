I said that sometimes "looks" are all that important, just like Jeremy Clarkson from BBC has pointed out (not on earth though, but it's right anyway). <br /> But when it comes to looks, this movie is like an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see. <br /> Then there's the personality of the movie as well, interesting, with a fascinating narrator voice and storyteller that will touch your soul as you look at these superbly filmed images. The movie probably will not affect your life, damaging these lovely, but it will certainly remind you how precious our earth lives on really is. <br /> This movie deserves it to 10 stars as it is one of the stylistic documentaries I really enjoyed.
