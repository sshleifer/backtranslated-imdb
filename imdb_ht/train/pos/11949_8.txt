The second film Woody Allen put in London. Tha Tarot Thousands of murderers murdered prostitution in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). He starts his romance, but quickly falls in love. It helped by South Waterman (Woody Allen) stage magician who does not like what she sees. <br /> I like this much better than "Match Point" of last year. It was shorter and moved faster. The old plot but I was entertained and it kept me guessing until the very end. It's not really a comedy but a mystery and a few very good comedy lines (all from Allen of course). It's not one of the best Allen, but it's far better than his worst. The act is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad but he plays this character a million times before and he's gotten fat. But Johansson and Jackman are just great - they look fantastic and give two highly attractive credible performance. Also Allen (surprisingly) working on sex appeals - there is a sequence where both are in the bathing suits shown in their beautiful bodies. The only real debit is that Allen still looks after how to inject London. It's not as off as it was on "Match Point" though - maybe it'll just get better as it goes along. <br /> <br /> Worth to see. I give it a 8.
