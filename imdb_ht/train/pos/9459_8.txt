I watch romantic comedy with some hesitation, for romantic comedy featuring old age clich√©s that make a movie worthwhile. Typically in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both falling in love, then having problems, and then having on the marriage issues or whatever. But this film is a different story, it is really very different from the Romantic comics I've seen in recent years. <br /> There is a widow guy (Dan), having a girl (Marie). Then meet Marie in a bookstore and talk for sometime, after a moment Marie left. Then develop something for her, and when this begins to turn off, we get a twist. Marie is his girlfriend girlfriend. Chaos in the circumstances, Dan flirt with Marie and realize that he loves her, and even Marie loves her, but love could not be just possible. How it is made possible form the rest of the story. Steve Carell does well, Juliette Binoche is good Marie. And everything else that does well. It's a good movie, look at it.
