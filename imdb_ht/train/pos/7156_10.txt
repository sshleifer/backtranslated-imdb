Hole is an awesome movie. I love it very much and is one of my favorite films. It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney non-cheese. Hole is generally a very cool motion picture. I wish Disney would do more pictures like it. Hole is indeed a rare crossword in Disney's cool tremor show. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean bad lips Disney but most of it's aimed towards children with this OKY. Children also deserve their entertainment. But Disney was guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's kind of any movie of any age can look and enjoy and not once think it's blown. Really, it's kind of movie that even a lot of young teens can enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to. Hole does a great job of being a mix of good family entertainment but was not too cheesy and living a little over the corner. I hope Disney is getting more risky and doing much more than knit as something.
