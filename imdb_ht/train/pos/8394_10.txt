Maria Braun was married right between combat all around him and her husband Hermann. An explosion torn in the building, to begin with, and he and Hermann signed the papers on a pile of debris on the street. Maybe this may hit some as a metaphorically-but for what will happen: wedding on the rocks, so to speak. She is a fiancee where the husband goes to war and held in a prison camp of Russia, unbenownst Maria's without discouraging, but hopeless and proud, who kept standing in the debris depression at the train station as some come home, others Do not, and a sign awaits Hermann. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, will make a two figure: it will stand by his man, though that means working in a bar for the American GI, and, even after he heard from a fellow soldier that Hermann died will still stand by him 'as he sleeps with a black GI and comes close to bring his children (that is, naturally, until he reappears with a murderer and takes the rap to be safe), or working for a German businessman (effectively sympathetic Ivan Desny) and gets sometimes his mistress and rising star of the company. Mary will do everything she can to succeed, but she will always be married. It's hard to say that nothing about Maria is not fascinating. Money, sex, power, all these can be substituted for Maria. It is like the feminist whose cake and eating it with a smile smile: it gets to have a husband, more or less (actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the movie) while finding things - a man who dots on it whenever he can, a new home with expensive and domestic, a secretary, money - that others around him do not receive due to previously being with a man or too weak in a position to lift anywhere (like the secretary, played interesting enough by Fassbinder's own mother). Maria is sexy, confident, and all alone, and an ideal life goes against a life that should be done in the shade. He tells the two men - the American soldier and poor old and sick Oswald - that he's the fanatic, and at the same time is huddled by these romantic man and confused soul-Hermann sent from Canada, after they were released from prison. It's a profile that a feminist would like to scam, but understanding where it came from and going all the way. <br /> <br /> Fassbinder employed this inherent contradiction, and moments with Maria appear to go against the conventions of a Melodrama (for example, Hermann is walking on the Jubilant and half-naked Maria and GI is just about a prince of a scene, and Maria's reaction is not in surprise or guilt but early to see that she's alone alive), while sticking to her guns as a director of high-minded techniques and a storyline that would be predictable. But it's not really. It's such a great metaphor for a country that, after the war, could not really move on to normal. A few times Fassbinder puts the sound of the radio in the background, and we see Maria walking in her family home, hustle and bustle will be on her side, and the radio talk in a divided Germany, of things that are still very disturbing, in a disarray. Perhaps the only way to deal is over, or maybe that's just my interpretation. <br /> It's hard to say, really, under Schygulla's random face and eyes, anyway. It's such an incredible performance, really, one of these showstoppers that captures the glamor and attracts to an old time Hollywood star girl while with the down-and-laugh ethic of a girl in the streets. Most say the costume is opposite one to see in one scene when it finally is with her husband, where she starred in one of these super-lustful black lingerie pieces with high heels, and then move on a dress without even thinking about it. That's almost the essence of what is Maria, and beautiful Schygulla gets it down, a headstrong face, but somehow likes to worship and embarrassed by the guys around him, sometimes in a single sentence. This is what Fassbinder captures in its wonderful first part of its "trilogy"; while I could generally prefer Veronika Voss as a masterpiece, Maria Braun is perhaps just as good as a character study, in what makes a female tick and tock and (almost) nothing is lost.
