I will keep this short justice for no harm to you. This movie is awesome. From the beginning to end, it is filled with genuine emotions. The battle scene is fantastic, the Chase scene is enthralling, and it moves at a speed that it really only felt slow at the end when it was explained, but that's just because everything was before it. Damon shines and really proved a very solid actor, daring you do not believe him in that role. It is this role. A welcome addition to the series of David Straithrain (hopefully spelled off the right) as a serial CIA agent from Kill Bourne. This is stopped and will really leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the road. Some things toward the end are just a preposterous smidgeon, thus negating a rating 10. It's finished that remains open for suites and I'm sure hoping to consider doing more of these, so none were bad. Excellent movie all at all with a fantastic end to an amazing trilogy. The chat worried did not hurt any of the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.
