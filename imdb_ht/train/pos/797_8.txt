For those who do not follow the case Marie Marie Fahey assassinated. You are missing out to one of the most sad yet complicated people at all. The assassin is Delaware's famous lawyer, Tom Capano and the victim are Secretary of Governor Delaware's, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well kept secret until its collapse and murder. She wanted to leave her but she just would not let her go easily. On the other hand, she had a mistress with a wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two mistresses with a domestic family life? In addition, the case is very complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini set. While the actress plays Ms. Fahey doing a fine job, she does not have her hair long. Her other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman. Brand Harmon is best looking and performs an Emmy award winning performance as Tom Capano. It would be best and actually place Delaware and Philadelphia. With Ann Rule's executive power, he adds the accuracy of Anne Marie's features to organization and personal struggles with a food disorder. These bits of information may be neglected by any other executive or directors. If you do not read the book, it is well worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating comedy of true crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He played former friend Ann Rule and Ted Bundy in another adaptation book many years ago. It was brilliant then and now. It does a job higher than average and an amazing story. Even President Clinton offered his assistance in Anne Marie Fahey's case. And now, former Governor Tom Carper is currently the United States Senator for Delaware who has been overwhelmed, popular incompetent Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read the Settlement Book.
