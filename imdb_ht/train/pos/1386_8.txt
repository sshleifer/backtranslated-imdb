Three girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The basis of the triangle is barely there. At the peak is Marie, a serious tomb, short and lean and a Belmondo-like facial structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquettish, chubby - I dare say fat - and want to kiss her first with a boy, but not quite ready to meet her first sexuality. Because of its chubbiness, boy does not seem interested and pain him. <br /> <br /> Other at the foot of the peak is a beautiful "filling filling" blonde wave. It is deeply involved in the sport in syncing to swim in competitive levels. Marie saw her during a competition at the local public pool. Marie insinuates himself in the life of the vampire using the desire to become a swimmer to synchronize as an argument. The vampire has a reputation for being a whore, making out with any young man who orbit around her. Marie is not phased out by this reputation. Put a stress on reputation. <br /> The first half is set up. We get to see a lot of syncing swim as we become familiar with the three girls. Eventually the leaf narrative synchronizes rear swim and focuses on the topsy-pain relationships among the three. That's when unexpected things happen. <br /> It is a trademark of French movie released nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This one is no exception. Here she is on the ceiling and the die. Watch the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The principal says that the use of naquis syncing is purpose. Sports women-only is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface while hardworking and competitive down. A number of scenes drives this point: elegant movements and smiles for the public, never kicked ungainly under water. The title of French is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggests a person who has to juggle many pressure together.
