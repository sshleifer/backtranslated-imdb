There are good ways to make a movie and bad way with this very ancient. This short-haired exporter has nothing more than it gives the audience. It presents a simple story, said very clearly with wisecracks enough to keep you going, then just getting better and better. Clooney's in the cage is funny and very welcome, but the drives including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily make it on their own. Looks like it's funny, hilariously so towards the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heistist genre.
