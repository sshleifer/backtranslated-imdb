Yes, if I tell you to compare the black knight and some 18-year-old film-adapted movie rated 5.9, will you call me crazy? It's just getting your attention. Every day I meet people who complain no good movies, which seem to only know the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to research and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic value. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not easily be outdated, in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews mostly complain about the story "messed up" the DT. But it appears to me that the storyline is clearly, and I had no problem after it. I did not see the comic books, but I'm not a great American comic fanatic, but I appreciate self-film film-making and performance. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too high on the story it would be. But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect. I had some scratches on myself, and can not help but wonder, we really saw the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it sounds, has always been able to pull it up with the audience charms. Madonna was more express-less than "breathe" in her seductive role, but she added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigious to himself. Apparently it was dark enough to go sarcastic about his already successful role. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomach to make us laugh. And thanks a lot to make-ups. <br /> <br /> For me it's not bad at all. The central feeling really got me.
