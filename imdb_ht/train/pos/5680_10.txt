This crap spirit is so hysterical! Why do not Americans write such writing? For anyone who thinks comedy has to be dumb - there is more understanding and intelligence in six episodes of this series than in a rack of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete crowd. I could not believe he was the same guy as House! There are many great lines and gigs in this series you could watch every dozen show at times and still pick up new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verb, and puts on Edmund's butler. This is my favorite in the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful ever since the heart is somewhat obtuse in the series, "The Mass Press" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines are: "When someone unites with a Wellington he really puts his foot on it" and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder's "top tipper seller" and suicide suicide from Scotland.
