Seriously, can you imagine such a talent spread in one movie without a big budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Jou Lewis deserve the awards: but it would have been entirely justified to see O'Conor (like Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: The stereotype is true here: they do not rely on them them. Day-Lewis' performance is a journey of strength - such as a transformation that it is trembling-induced, but it's really a brand of academia's intelligence that along with this performance, they also honored excellent treatment Brenda Fricker, always with heart-wrenching work as mother Christie. By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actress in "Swann", that's another movie well worth checking out for her contribution (and Miranda Richardson's sublime).
