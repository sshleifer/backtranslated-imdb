Well, I say a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know seen. It's a movie movie boyfriend starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) and some flirting stories about a motorcycle prototype that misses cars or something, but that does not matter. The purpose of this film is fun is because of the interaction between the two behaviors, who initially gripped and challenged each other but in a shocking twist of fate to become friends. It's all the difference in culture to do well, in that it's fun to look, it's completely ridiculous but in a kind of cheesy and enjoyable way. The soundtrack is cool, once again in a cheesy 80's way, it suits the movie, I was trying to find one of the songs for ages, but as I'm working in memory of what I think some of the words I could not seem to find it. Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic cut payment of any movie ever, but I will not give that one away, oh no! In conclusion I would take this film about 48 hours / most of Eddie Murphys production including Beverly Hills cop, and whatever Buddy junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence has their names. If you're looking for a movie cop friend and getting fed up with "white right cop satisfy zany streetwise black cop" give this a shot. You might be surprised by this cosmodul the whole formula down and "the Japanese cop right to satisfy streetwise white cop". <br /> I give this 7. to be honest I like it more than that. I would rather see this than a lot of things I would give 8. But I guess I know deeply that it's some sort of madness that makes me like this movie.
