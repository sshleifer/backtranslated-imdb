The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribes of Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross the rivers and hills to get to grazing. You will feel like a tummy tin after looking at those cattle in cold ice and barefoot in the snow crossing the mountains while trying to find the animals walking along steep and narrow mountains.
