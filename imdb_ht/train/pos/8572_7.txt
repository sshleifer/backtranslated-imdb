The first movie was a nice, but it is not as wonderful as the classic animated which I find more intense and endearing. This end is inferior, but not bad at all. Ensure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad of inspire. But dogs are very nice here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The movie is the beautiful look and stylish screen with eyes popping suit (especially the Cruella), with the pleasant music. The act is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing to Gerard Depardieu while providing better performance to have fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best advantage, as it was with the first movie, is the amazing Glenn Lock in a delightful performance on the top as Cruella, even more wrong than it was already. In general, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
