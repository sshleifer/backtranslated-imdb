I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment Tom Long walked into shot - everything 'bad boy' the thing, it was just addictive. The story you've hooked, what will happen next - Joey will get the girl to the end, after 5 years in prison, and all this time thinking about losing her, crossing his path, again, get it a son ... Although he's a bad guy violent, you still want him to get happiness. <br /> A really fascinating two party - please bring it out on video!
