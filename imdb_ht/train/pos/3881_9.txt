This movie has grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence that deceived me in a complete reverse of perspective, so I was hooked in the time the title came up. This film theme is that everyone acts, trying to re-invent themselves, but not in a difficult way like identity or suspicion to teach, but in the way we all try to make regardless of how life we ​​find ourselves in little more interesting. The scene of the spectacular chicken deposits. At one point Jorgen (who owns chicken farms) goes to a seminar at street, where he is the worst student. Her discomfort in this allows you to see the depth of her desire to change herself. The film makes me wonder of the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most common people I see everyday. There's not a lot to draw here. Guessing the old man's secret is very easy, but the passion lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out. This movie was appealing to me as Sideways did, although the characters could not be more extinct.
