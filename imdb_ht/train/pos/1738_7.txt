This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star that signed a sponsor and Ned Beatty chicken restaurant. The deal has all kinds of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing Burt to put a chicken costume during the race! Jim Nabors is (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) Appointed by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strictly adopt the deal. This is a funny movie in which Burt proves that it's not too proud. I love it!
