I really enjoyed this movie. I'm one father and a 17 year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I want my girl to apply herself well to solve the crimes and help others! So for me, maybe this is PG level Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teenage years, long ago, long ago. Make sure that this character was skillfully played by Emma Roberts, but did not resemble Nancy Drew I remember from the books. This is due to script, does not act. Emma is an adorable adolescent, plays a self-confident character, hard work and proud and good behavior and good taste. It does not keep in mind the competitiveness of the trend around it. There are some weaknesses in the scheme, aside from the resemblance to Nancy Drew of the Books, and try to discover what decades we are in. (Like, what car, Anyway?) I read the IMDb overview before seeing the movie, as I did research on Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I'm going to continue looking for more in her movie. Rachael was too old to play this lead, but he did a good job as the central orphan central of the mystery. <br /> I'm very disappointed in other comments written here. Some expect perfect connections with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult movie films. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well targeted teen girls, And Fathers want good kids and high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a teen PG movie, by James Bond! What would you like to be a model for your daughter's role?
