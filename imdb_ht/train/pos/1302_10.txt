So often a band will get together for a re-union concert only to find that they just can not get it together. Not so here. This concert is just brilliantly worn from start to finish. These three musicians obviously came along in advance and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic stomach to meet a month's. This is evident from the start, before the same step on stage. Many people in the crowd were not even born when the men first performed. From the first song to take that old magic cream, 3 people, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had stretched himself for this concert because there was no keyboard, synthesized etc. to get to see him at his best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why many drummer today, talking about him as some sort of gay drumming. Jack Bruce just great. They really manage to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come. That's one of 10 for me.
