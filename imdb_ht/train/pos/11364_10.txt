Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn, and Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performance. Sutherland is particularly skillful in this sort of role, where he must show a character whose morality, at first, the uncertainty of the audience. As so often the case with Sutherland's character, we must ask "is it a villain [in this case, a minor], or a hero?" <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently said, about the incompetence and scary bureaucracy of the former Soviet Union that prevented the efforts of highly competent people. As the southerland character character wryly notes, "The measurement of a bureaucracy is its ability to do no special exception". "Meeting of the committee" (between Rea and Sutherland characters) after perestroika is being implemented, and its revelations, have an impact on emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated ones who worked in this system. Here are some dramatic scenes that show victims of family members adding emotional resonance and impact to the story. This is rarely a feature of a movie with the topic of illness, but effectively reminds us that the victims lived, and they loved. This is a sad, but very important movie, which deserves its showcase of Canadian History History.
