I saw "An American in Paris" on its first release when I was still in school and fell in love with it too. I went back to the next day and lost count of the number I've seen since, both in the movie theater and on television. He performed fantastic in some of the best music and singing by the famous folk composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancer in Hollywood history. Supported by Oscar Levant (as original as ever), Georges Guetary (why he does not make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliantly in an unsympathetic role) at the top of their form. Close the ballet, superbly choreography of the title music, makes excellent use of sights and sounds in Paris and in the images of Impressionist and post-Impressionist artists. All Gershwin songs are very well-known, but most memorable are "It's very clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I got rhythm" (children in Paris joining Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine "). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it!
