I totally agree. I thought that this was a great movie for kids.Dawn prices from gilligans, and promises to show off a barely then dana platato.it was disneylike and so that it can hardly be ignored as fluff sense. 'Do not be afraid and did not mean to be.It does not ruin the finish. But it was strange the way he did.I mean the kids characters were great and I did not know what to expect in The basic draw end.they also had a lot more to do with these kids than telling the fact that these children were very central fishermen experts on the scheme especially initialally.it also helped them out of a jam towards the end.it also had more of being overly long.I think about it in the under 95 minutes
