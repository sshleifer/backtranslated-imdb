This is one of the first movies I've ever seen. For a very low budget, it has done well; As an insomniac myself, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problem has never been as intense or as disturbing. <br /> Well, directed, in a subject that I have not seen much in the lighting theater, it puts both perfect for the movie environment. There are some apparent goofs, but they may be intended; you will see after watching the movie. The film is something personal, and worth watching twice. No movie is impeccable, but a Hollywood version could not make the story much better. all in all, 8/10.
