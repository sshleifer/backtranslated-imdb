This video was my first expository of Eddie Izzard. We had several friends for one night and for some reason or another there was channel-navigating at HBO during the course of the evening. One by the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on.I tried not to laugh too loud in the first few jokes. I did not want to be held "responsible" for the rest of the group's fun of something that was obviously killed me. After holding in my laugh for more than health, I let go - like making the others in us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor talk of insurance and pensions ...). We were asphyxiated later. The story lines, the plot, the bizarre yet inventive spirits of all the drawings are nothing short of bright. I've since been addicted to every Eddie-Izzard-piece-of-comedy I can get my hand on. His work is absolute engineering. His comedy seems easy. It looks more like this funny zetrie friend hanging out of your home and rambling over on this or that ... It's compelling funny. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you .. and herself, the only true illustrations of humor, after all. If you're disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate in humor or humor, as they say in the UK.
