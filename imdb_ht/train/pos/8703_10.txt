I went to this movie after reading it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who made a monster by society. Try to say I was hoping something entirely different from what I got. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead is not the bad look helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it took them until the 3rd party in the movie now each other's name has all the moverieth street) keep you entertained and invest in the story. So in short: Is not what I hope, but a very good surprise indeed. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
