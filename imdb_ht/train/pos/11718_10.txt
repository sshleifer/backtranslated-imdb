Those who love Elivra as I did in the late night night her hostess movie will love this movie - it's just plain fresh - its car is great, and it's a bit of a Transylvanian Dolly Parton - it's so The innocent and naive at times - and sexy all the time - more, more than one touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets well done as well, with the funny cast is great, and Edie McClurg In normal it is better - more Sally Kellerman as Patty is hilarious. Whenever I have something crunch for a topping, I'll think of how Elvira crunches the potato chips - <br /> <br /> This movie is one to look again and again - just for the fun of it . Now I have to find the end to it, Elvira's Haunt Hills, and see if she lives up to this one ----
