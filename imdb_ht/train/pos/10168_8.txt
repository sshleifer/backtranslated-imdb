Look at Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a girlfriend staring at the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who puts "gender Panther gender" in Anchorman. If you are waiting for a Golden Globe nomination film then you need to think about how you watch the movies. However, if you are willing to stop reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. It's funny as it was about Friends and it was funny and good looking at all at the same time. I went with my wife, she loved it and so I did.
