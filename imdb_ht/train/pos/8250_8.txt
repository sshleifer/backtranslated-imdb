This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this death (called zombies) they appeared to eat the living food. However, a company has developed a collar that, when placed around the zombie course, make them domestic and perfect servants. Helen of Robinsons (Carrie-Anne Moss), Bill Bill (Dylan Baker) and Timmy's son (K'Sun Ray) hired a zombie because everyone on the block already has one. Tim Fido's Zombie Name (Billy Connolly) and become friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy controls Fido control and things go wrong. As you can see this is - among many other things - a takeoff on the series "Lassie" and Fido were standing in for Lassie. Timmy called this for a reason! Each single of the famous Lassie episodes are filed here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat it! Also it is a satire in the 1950s Douglas sikk films where everything is bright and colorful - but the black secrets are torn apart. Characters wear VERY bright 1950s dress (Moss is still in a dress) - furniture, environment and machinery especially throughout the 1950's of color too bright. Even when the script gets rehearsal there's always something to look at. The script is good - but there are just so many Lassie jokes you can do. Melodramatic are kind of funny but thrown in to pull it off. Everyone here is excellent and right on target. Even Connolly as an emotional zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every line for all its values ​​--- but never goes further. <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). The satire can be lost on most people and the Gore is very tame. Gore is so relaxed and happy to play on it it's hard to take it seriously. So, for some, this will really work. I give it a 8.
