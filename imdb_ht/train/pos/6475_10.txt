Only 2 episodes of a 5 part drama, but I can already declare that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. This on TV, screen or even in real life. As a writer, it's so good at almost demoralizing! As a viewer it's so fun that I annoy the episodes are more than a fifth instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are actually positives. <br /> I'm a modern guy who has already turned on from TV drama. In comparison to movies, TV dramas always seem to be dating, well tame, and well, generally boring! "Five days" has really brought TV drama into the 21st century, so for at least, it's mind changing. Go ahead.
