This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, smart witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. I was well enjoy this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on novel Neil Gaiman's novel that I now read) and colorful characters. The most striking thing I actually was is how the head of the story is. Unlike many sci-fi movie cinema outdoors now end-to-end with such a fairy-tale fairy, meeting in and of itself with no need for an end. Fun. Feeling good fantasy.
