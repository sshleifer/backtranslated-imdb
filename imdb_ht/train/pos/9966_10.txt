I saw this film when the Mystery Science Theater was in 1993. It is the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad in fact, that by absolute freakiness, this movie must find a ten rating because he must see to be believing. <br /> Anyone who wrote this script and the idea kids should beat them. I mean, really, the Devil vs. Santa? Vision of Hell? Climb street van-up queen? Forced Children Work With Racial Stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crow during the MST3K show, "This is good oil 'gas nightmare!" <br /> There are plenty of innuendo strangely and aiming up Theology. Merlin (presumably Merlin's Arthurian) hanging out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (Heaven Damage). Santa talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for kids asking for siblings. There are symbols around the castle that either looks like pentagram or star RAF. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have to look it every year since 1993 and we suggest anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us.
