He is such an extraordinary singer, who cares for anything else !!!! That final stage is one of the best moments of all nonexisting biz-bar shows! I am glad he kept the camera on his head for ten minutes - he deserved iconic status - as is the power of the voice. I saw this first movie when I was five and he had a big impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther wants to leave the right couple as she announced her award). <br /> But some of the other user reviews are just plain fake - I mean, where is the free nudity - maybe we've seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's song ability is monumental, and if it has a great month - fine! <br /> <br /> It touches it.
