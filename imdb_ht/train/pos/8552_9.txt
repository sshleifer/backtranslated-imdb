This is by far one of my favorite American Americans spin offs mostly because of most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always looks unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example AP: The naked mile. You have a young guy surrounded by nude college chic, and has one particular warm on his trail to get rid of her virgin girl, finishing up mid-deer and riding a horse back in sleeping with his girlfriend, who keeps in mind gave him a "couple free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic; Most people watching these movies do not particularly look for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> Whereas most recent slices finally seem to realize who the audience with good old Erik Stifler looks awake and smells of roses and as always Mr. Levenstein borrows the humorous "perfectly natural" humor the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
