A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for murdering an innocent girl and putting on death row. Sean Connery plays "happy go chance" lawyer that the grandmother's grandmother tracks down from retired and pleaded with taking on the case in the hope of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is bending hell about debunking a theory that Connery could dig up to try and free the boy to whom he and all the swearing police officers are guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, and the late Lynne Thigpen co-star of this very dramatic comedy.
