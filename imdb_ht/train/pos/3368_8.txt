A visit by Hitler in Rome is the series of tender stories of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children living in the house throughout his family to attend the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He stayed home since family can not afford a maid. He would like to go even though he and the housing complex wherever he lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce. There is only one exception though. Through the courtyard sitting Marcello Mastroianni on his seat contemplating suicide. The reason? It is homosexual and because of what has recently lost its job as an announcement of radio. The movie really takes in when those two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and seriously in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own husband coping incompetent Mastroianni and in a master's injection, directing and acting on the roof of the building complex offers her body to her only to be rejected. The initial shock is replaced by soon after it's hungry for the man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, the other world is so willing to give it all it longs for .. This is a very good crafted film and two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is an actress of well-directed gauge. This is a simple but yet powerful movie about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad end there is a glimpse into the hope of the denial, things will change, someone has understood.
