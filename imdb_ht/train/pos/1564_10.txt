Chloe is mysteriously saved from Dr Caselli, the corruption physician responsible for transferring patient skills from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, with a fraction of the second later Clark occurs. He found that Bart Allan returned to Smallville and met with each other at Kent Farm. When Bart was captured by Lex during a break at a LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovered that Arrow Green had also hired Bart (a.k. impetus), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate the project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the Trio to save Bart and invite Chloe to participate in the missions. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the ultimate episode of this 6th season. In this episode, the Justice League begins its legendary association with the five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash (Impulse), Aquaman and Cyborg. The involvement of Chloe is spectacular, completing the necessary organization of the team. In the end, Oliver breaks up with Lois based on the importance of fighting against Criminal and Lex's secret lab around the world. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
