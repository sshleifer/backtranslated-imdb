go to 60 sec. where I started, he caught you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. People say it's not a good movie I agree to make sure there are some cheesy parts but that movie action does not. I gave it an 8 out of 10 causes of the action and the funny rescue if you like the Rock or Face Off than this movie is right up your cage alliance cage to a great job along with one of the lowest rated actors of my mind Del-Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people look away from movies some times you need to sit back enjoying the movie and after asking yourself to have realized what they show. This means that if they go for action, it's park action. if they are trying to make a movie changed as movies are made and trying to win every premium out of their well being? I think they've made the action movie to put out to do, give it a chance and you'll regret.
