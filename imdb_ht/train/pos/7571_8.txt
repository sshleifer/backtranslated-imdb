This game is arranged above all so far. I had the honor of playing my PS2 so the graphics were really good. The voice acting was the highest standard. Levels of difficulty are just right. Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story was surprised me and it took many different twists that I did not wait. The only rating worthy of this game is great.
