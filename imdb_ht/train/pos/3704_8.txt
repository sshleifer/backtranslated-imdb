It is usually difficult to read the movies - & - paste. Some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product. In this one, for example, the entire-girl scene at the doctor's office was quite interesting ... one of the best in watching this story (limited) viewing history. Then there is in the Asia segment ... The lady is always fun. And the story that tied all together was an interesting concept. The swap scenes close off the offer are not bad either. Technically, their production value is fairly high. Recommended.
