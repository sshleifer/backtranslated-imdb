Without a doubt, Private Lesson II is the greatest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (wrong) translates into English, a joy to look. Not much of it makes sense, but it does not matter. It is the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny. The movie is rare and available on video, but I kept it a couple of late time, late at night on cable pay. I watched dozens and dozens of times as I slowly, people-by-human, featuring this gem movie in the world. Joanna Pacula plays tutor / lover at Ken, our hero. (It apparently was just working for her check.) Ken played by Goro Inagaki, in Japan pop pop pop pop, who gave it all her and has great hair in the movie out. Stacy Edwards, in the "Company of Men" fame, shows the film too much and is probably happy to have found other movie afterwards. It takes at least three viewing figures to figure out what the scheme is. On repeating look you can enjoy elements like the usual amount of vase Ken had in her home (at least 50) or Ken is wearing a shirt and wallet hauling in the final movie. The movie is predictable but very quotable. My friends and I reenact the entire scene. Yes, it sounds like we are defaming our lame defender ... but we're defaming the lame defender who has seen "Private Lesson II." Have one of the ten people in the world who saw this film. You will thank me for it.
