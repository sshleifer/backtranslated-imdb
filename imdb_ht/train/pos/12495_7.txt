What's good about it: There are some inventive and really climbing little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasonal horror fans. Do not rely on the ribs to tear the strips for its "gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are still a few things in this movie that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> What could be better about it: the act was, at times, flat and compelling. It has a kind of "shot-on-video" in some places (though, it mostly achieves the atmosphere he's been trying to), and the camera work is all unlimited shut-ups in nonsense. Even though the effects are really creepy, I think they can go to the pipes some times too many and some of them. The finish seemed to run, and glossed on what could have more impact moments. The viewer leaves face out a lot of things for themselves, not as a challenge by the filmmakers, but because they just miss it. <br /> Still, a little little independent little movie that is easy to step above the average. Well worth the rental.
