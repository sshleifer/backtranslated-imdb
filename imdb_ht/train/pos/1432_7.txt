I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it was published as a movie-be seen for those who love cinema on nature. The film shows different climates and creatures associated with them by starting from the North Pole and down the south as the film progresses. The footsteps from this film are often breathtakingly beautiful and I am often amazed how on Earth they might have taken some of the underwater or heavenly shots. However beautiful, a big part of the foot I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth', told by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's narratives in the Planet Earth to be better than the narration on Earth. 'Earth' is an easier movie. He scatters many of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. For example, Earth is telling you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young cow, because there are some predators. Planet Earth is telling you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because the water is low in oxygen and does not have enough nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me, this is an important difference. That, along with the far superior voice of Attanborough, makes planet Earth a better documentary than Earth. Still, however, I think Earth is worth to look for the beautiful feet and the fact that it's easier to understand to make it interesting for kids too.
