Preminger classics in classical noir work almost as a flip-side in LAURA ... while the film was glitzy and features the Clifton Webb's high-elite, this film is a whole lot of seamier. Dana Andrews is a less likely cop accidentally killing a man only having it potentially estimated on the father of the girl he likes. Preminger keeps things moving in a brisk clip so that holes in the logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is fine (a lot less wooden than it was in the past) and beautifully beautiful Gene Tierney's feeling is stunningly beautiful! Climb Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see with a terrific companion piece first equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also start Tierney).
