"Happenstance" is the movie in New York that feels Parisien I've seen since "When the cat goes (Chacun cherche son cat)." A film in recent years released now capitalized on attention to Audrey Tatou getting for "Amelie," her French title best: "The Bataille d'Ailes du papillon (beaten in the butterfly wing)" as in the summary of the theory chaos as a controlled element in our lives. <br /> Gamine-Tatess Tatou is less annoying here because it only occasionally shines that smiles brightly among his hapless adventures, and because it's part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble, so great that it takes I long to sort out the characters, especially as some of the lovely guys and older women seem to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do so that I was not sure they did you do not. But I liked how urban coincidences were, from immigrants to their nestled car in crowded train cars hanging around cafes. <br /> <br /> The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both sides of a dialogue at Once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
