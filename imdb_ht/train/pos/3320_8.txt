I loved this movie, nice and funny. I found this movie to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made reference to New York Yanki. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that Yankees NY is a hallowed word.Sorry says that in Yankee fans. I recommend this picture to the whole family. Of course with your love / comedy movie, there is a moment of the movie, and I'm in love with what I do, but the movie makes up for that and all the moments slapstick. The movie shows at some moments in how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) how fans have felt about 86 years of the sox still aiming up the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the like with someone else go hand in hand.
