Of course, the original is better, but this is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it is made up of 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was good to be honest. I actually liked how Anastasia changed slightly when she fell in love and showed what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> I love Cinderella's voice better in this too. I have nothing against his voice in the original, but I just think it sounds best here, more nicer. I liked her personality in this too, she had more of a scream, yet it was still kind. <br /> So I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams come true a 7/10.
