This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and some funny bits. I laugh every time in Millie, the maid pretends to be a beginner, holds her hello while chatting, and mindlessly polishing furniture with her as she chats. I just can never get past French accent he never was a problem as they tried to spend it as daughter of the boss. <br /> <br /> Viewing a teenager Mel Torme and singing in many Frank Sinatra is like a treat. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in a theater at the same time this movie came out. He said that they could not clear the "bobby-soxers" out between cinemas (in those days you did not have to be left between protests). This movie shows you how to attract and appeal to the young Frank and allow you to appreciate her talent too early. And Victor Borge gets in a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet, simple storyline. Very enjoyable.
