This is a great movie if you see in a proper context - It meant to be a parody of teenage-horror-Satan-worshiped parody (and '80s have seen many of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out, and immediately loved it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. With nothing and OZZY as a metal-hate preach can not be all bad! Also, Fastway was already a favorite to me, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. The original VHS (this was preceded by DVD) is covered for trick or treats featuring an illustrated Sammi kneeling, playing her guitar in a ring of fire and a "devil" looking over. It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at the time (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not at cost is ridiculous. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release. The company releases it probably calculates Gene and Ozzy were the only people recognized in the movie, so they were best placed on the cover! The same thing as the original "Little Horror Shop" - Jack Nicholson was in it for all five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if it was the main star. <br /> I have a "Trick or Treat Site", and it's surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate the myths by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'Sammi Curr'. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it's just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. Definitely should not be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!
