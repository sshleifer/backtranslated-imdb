A pre-string stunner and Stanwyck play a speakeasy whore who sleeps his way to the top. These pre-code cops really leave it all away and nothing leaves the imagination. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly daughter a special master / father who has sold more bottles to her clients (Johns) .After old man dies (good!) Barb chief for the big city for the best of her and her female attribute to sleep her way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "camouflage" and proves that actors get better and age with a coaching act. I loved the interior and strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie films and they look at Stanwyck who is great and beautiful like Lilly.
