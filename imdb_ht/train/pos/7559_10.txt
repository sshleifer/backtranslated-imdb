This movie is just fine! Although Carmen Electra, this has to be one of the best films I've seen in a moment. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Loren Dean plays a movie star movie star very well. The plot is great as well. It's all very real that is scary. He says here it's a drama, but this is one of the faint damn drams I have ever seen. Go check it out.
