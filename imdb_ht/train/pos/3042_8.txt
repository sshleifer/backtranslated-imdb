The movie transports everyone back to October 20, 1944 where we seemed to be a big part of the Philippine scene 'I should return' landing ?? It was about Leyte shore where General MacArthur had gathered his fame ?? <br /> <br /> Above all, Gregory Peck triumphs in his painting of the great general ?? It is the stride, the shoulder set, the intensity ?? That's what both men had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion ?? With MacArthur he was for the military ?? With Peck it was for the challenge of acting ?? An Academy Award winner for "Murder a Mockinbird", an Oscar candidate for "Keys of the Kingdom", "The Yearling," "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Twenty O'Clock High"? He plays everything from an apparently omnidal amnesia to a journalist crusading; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsolete attorney; from Biblical David Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? He brought them all his own unique, character, sincerity, warmth and love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on deck with 'The President of the Philippines.' We can hear the dialogue: "Generally, I hope the water is not too deep," says the President, "because my people are finding out that I can not swim." Then comes peck sounding voice: "And my people will find that I can not walk on water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur," Peck once again justifies its reputation as a giant in the film industry ?? Through it we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness, and we understood the relationship with his whole family ??
