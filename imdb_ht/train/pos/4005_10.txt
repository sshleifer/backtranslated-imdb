Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into the graduate, I said that Mother did an excellent job to explain the sexual desire of an older woman. <br /> I'm so happy this is a British movie because Hollywood would never do it, and even if they were, they would have lost it by not taking the time to develop their characters. <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The act is superb, the characters are decadent decree, and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what happened, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story. <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must confess, I'll forever look at my mom in a different light!
