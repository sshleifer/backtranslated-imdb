It is an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Great games from Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point on playing screen. Generally playing screens in most movies from Turkey is not enough, but there are the best shots to be said "perfect" .And also part transitions they are really excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! causes and psychological consequences given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is combine all the hints. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a partial aggression impression Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played. This performance can be more realistic than "Monica Bellucci". The last thing I mean is "See this movie, you will get confused"
