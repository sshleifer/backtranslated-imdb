For many, Beat Street has inspired the forms of something creative about the hip hop culture. Lee Lee lives in NY at 80 when Hip Hop was at its start. She is a crew member of "Beat Street" - a b-boy crew. The film follows Lee on her average day, dancing, grafitiing, etc. The director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie features old school features such as Africa Bambaataa & Sonic Soul Force, Grandmaster Melo Mel & Five Wraths, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more .... <br /> No movie hit the street or the Beat Street spirit will ever die.
