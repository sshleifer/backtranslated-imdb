I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are so universal bad, unless I just cut off my rocker. I found it sick, bright, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. You will not get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this one. It has the coating layer, nuanced by Stone, and a plot that will keep you guess even after it's over. People need to find out about the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and Michael Douglas is not in this one. I predict that this movie will be a great hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to revive the professional professionals putting out. Give it a shot, you might be happy you did!
