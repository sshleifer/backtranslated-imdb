This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have different actors in the English version. Both were filmed back in because Garbo had such a one in Germany. Garbo himself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version of the English version. It's a good story and a must-see for Garbo fans.
