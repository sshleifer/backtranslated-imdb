This is one of the films of Dev Anand that has given great movies yet distinct indigenous film industry such as stealing jewelry and guides. The story is short (if you ask me what's the story), draw is simple - a brother looking for his lost sister. Sisters put the hippies that smoked from skin and song Hare Rama Rabbit Krishna. But the film shows some of the important events that the world has experienced in 70th.Hippie culture, submitting them to drugs, freedom, escape homework, family, and adopting anything new like Eastern (new to bliss) religion. They were handled perfectly. Zeenat gave it better and Dev as usual was remarkable. The songs are best used (unlike their abusing songs) in this movie. They were not spoiled.One perfect example is 'Discover another ... It has a badnam in the game'. Each word of the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that's not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji believes in making different movies was successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see the hippie culture of Nepal in 70 years.
