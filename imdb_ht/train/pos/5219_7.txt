Managed by Danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety that keep track of sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, referred to as the sheep. Managing is a vigilant obsessed who is on his way out. It is training, newly earned Allison, to take over his job. She looks at her sheep like very sick puppies, disturbed. He asks them questions that are not listed, and try to act like police and solve the crimes. It keeps warning for this behavior, hence the reason it has been replaced. During her final day of work, a young girl goes missing, and Babbage is sure she is one of her sheep who has lost head. He and Allison narrow a list down and discovered some of the offenders who went on safely. So she decides that she needs to follow the missing girl rather than help the police. This part is a little far away. <br /> There are some sick, twisted things to show in this movie. As Babbage and Allison go to this building where a bunch of people do things blunt with each other. Also, there are those who kidnap the girl. At the end of the film, we see that freaks are sick. However, I would not call this movie too much because not really much to show on film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
