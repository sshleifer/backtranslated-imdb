... So that's what's missing 10 minutes that were so terrible they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were three years in the film production code ... Barbara Stanwyck was starred in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Ko star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity", with Stanwyck, as well as his TV show "Three My Son". Keep an eye out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope Cinema) and Franklin Pangborn's Fabulous, which is just about every movie put on tapes. Of course, she works in the beauty salon on the boat! Add Charles Butterworth's Sublime and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and smart phone at the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella plays by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend of "Holiday" and "My God Godfrey". In "high swing", the Maggie tourist meets a soldier who left the army. Maggie misses his boat when he leaves ports and gets tangled with the soldier. Quinn's quinn-quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Band scramble together and try to figure out how to return to the United States. There are some good songs by Lamour. Good (but short) act performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", wise, useful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others were worried about how bad it was, it was not so awful, and it's even a bit exotic, and America's foal Center footholds for the first half of the movie.
