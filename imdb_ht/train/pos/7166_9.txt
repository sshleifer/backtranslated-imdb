Hip, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. I did not think I would like a novel; Plus, the other couple of books I was forced to read for the class was really bad. But in my surprise, I absolutely loved holes. It really is one of the most fraudulent women I've ever read. I think it has scarce quality that makes it appeal to adolescents, adolescents, and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, is going to get a better person. While I can not quite say that for the movie, I'm happy to say that they got it especially right. I do not think that viewers in the movie will walk away as rich, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effects of being stupid when they sit down. It's a smart story, and it's very well said. I think it moves a tad too fast. The Romans take more time to develop their characters. And the flashbacks come in and out quickly as they do not have too much time to register. Interesting Romans in the past feel more credible and frustrated than what they do in the novel. And ending, which links all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that does not quite exist in the movie. It works much better. I do not like the crowds in pop songs. I wish Disney did not feel like a necessity for selling soundtracks. Throw is across the board-excellent, from the young kids to the old pros. Jon Voight is especially great. Not quite sure why we need cartridge and the filler, though. 9/10.
