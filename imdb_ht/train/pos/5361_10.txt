If you have brought up on a diet in gameshows you will understand that you gradually need a larger and better range. Well, in the world of the Running Man, your need will be located. For this game shows, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate cost - many lives. <br /> I loved this movie. It was like a parody on the mind-numbing hole that we looked on a daily basis. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it's a very good movie. The concepts concealed that TV corporation will be one day to be "real" to the rulers of the planet is very credible, and it is very well described in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie One-Materials, my favorite is when it is about to be catapulted in the gamezone, the gamehow host asks "any last word?" Arnie says: "Yeah, I'm going back," but the host couple "Only in a re-run" and hastened the push button. I give this movie a 10 for absolute originality. I had to watch it 30 or more times. The movie just apart from the Hard Hard series that I watch this often !! <br /> In short, not for a minute thinking that you own T.V. - He owns you .....
