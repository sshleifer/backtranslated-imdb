This is one of the 80 movies that I can think of that was sadly neglected at the time and unfortunately, still neglected. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a horrible film neglected due to Salva's legal / sexual legal issues. Another would be Cameron's Closet that struck me as a bit underrated - not great, but not nearly as bad as the comments I saw. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it is one of the very quiet films that will just stick to your brain so far longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it and I still give some pauses, whereas something that I could see 6 months ago went to the ether.
