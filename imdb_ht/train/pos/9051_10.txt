I watched this time when my wife asked to ask for other rooms like my choice. My comments "I'm watching my life!" Even though younger, but only by 5 years or so, than the "Rocket Boys" I remember the sheer emergency and that Sputnick was welcomed by our administrators in education and how all Fair Science has gained momentum and took me and others in the big competitive turbo. My own tornado landed at My State's Fair Science Fair, in Physics by '62, though our group was less successful in taking the support, for example, our firefighters approached for advice and guidance until after a tragic event, Our city has gone far to allow us to visit the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore. <br /> <br /> This movie brought it all back to me and I'll bet that he brought it all back for a bunch of us "UberNerds" at 50 'late and at the beginning of the 60 . <br /> We are in a drainage drainage period now and really need this movie as a country. See it!
