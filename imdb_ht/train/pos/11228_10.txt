This is short and to the point. The storytelling for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is amazingly good. Acting is all over the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will come to the end of May 2007. <br /> I will not rehash what has already been said about along with the graphics. Consider this is all-volunteer, for no profit, it is very amazing. If that was being classified as a professional production, I should give it a 5 for a good story but horrible lying. However, as a fan-based producer I must give it an excellent rating as with the exception and a few other efforts, this is in a league of its own. For absolute volume, I do not think this was matching. Congratulations to cast and crew for a much admired effort.
