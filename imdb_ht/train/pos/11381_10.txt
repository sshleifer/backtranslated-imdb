The best part of an American in Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the personalization of living in several major painters. Kelly was earlier established as a pavilion artist in Paris, so the sequence is to terminate the logic of a musical clash with life and energy, Melbourne Gunes, and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at her best here - it's slightly different singin 'in the rain, and the effect of all the movie as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. No wonder the sequel ended 'This Entertainment' after all other MGM music has gone by!
