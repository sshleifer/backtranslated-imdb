One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia, but I came. I read it before I saw the movie and loved them both. It's the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not earn a living in Ireland. He also said from the perspective of the young man (who the other characters in the movie can see) and another young man who represents meaningless thoughts and feelings., But can not be seen by other characters in the movie. It's a very sad movie, but deeply touched, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to think about. I love any Irish movie, or almost any movie about Ireland, and any movie that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann in it gets my vote. I would like that gum gum for 2 hours on screen, and unfortunately, I have. Terrible shame has lost her so young.
