Imagine that I was on missing this great cultural event on Swedish TV last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV on (making it easier for him to fall asleep!) That I came across it (yes I saw an announcement for it already but of course forgot about it and was waiting for an 'early night ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - this should surely be a rather unusual idea - based on a documentary film about an interview made with sounds only over 30 years ago. But with anime and other material film documentaries it adds up to a really good and perspective portrait of one of the most appreciated artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> I'm sure you read my Tintin album with a different eye after seeing this movie, making it easier to connect the variations in style as well as the content and the different periods of Hergé's life ( and I can tell you that I'm going to get some of that I do not have. Of course my perception of the albums has changed over the over 25 years that I have already read, as I have seen on what albums are my favorites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension.
