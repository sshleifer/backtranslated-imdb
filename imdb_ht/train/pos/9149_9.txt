I never saw Richard Thomas playing a bad guy. I was not sure I'd love him this way. And I was not sure he could pull it. But this surprised me. He was crooked up my spine and gave me a closer look at street people. The movie is rugged and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all she can really play is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The finish was a little clumsy, but maybe that's how the real people would fight ... If you're a Thomas fan you must see him here at his best was bad!
