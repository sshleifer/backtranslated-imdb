Emma Jane Austen is a very enjoyable story of the worst of times and the output of this story is the best I've ever seen. Kama Beckinsale is irrepropriate. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good scenario and excellent cinematography) is able to carry out the comedy effectively, it fails to make Emma love. Paltrow does not help by the fact that her hairstyle is simply 'wrong' for the party (and I believe the era) and it looks positively sick of dressed in line empire. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and still can show that Mr Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's hero) actually sees in it. Strong brand is a beautiful Mr Knightly and the right mix of nice looks, an age appropriate, rivalry, compassion and kindness. Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful.
