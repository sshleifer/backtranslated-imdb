Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that she had no trace must have been looking for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! This film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot of any form or form. I would also like to remember these armies that if you are going to flare the crap out of this movie that they seem to miss the point. This film is clearly made for those who do not appreciate what's called "American Humor" which looks like me just a pile of smutty crap. The point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciated that some human sense of humor may not be in line with your own before you've fired your mouth. <br /> <br /> Thankyou
