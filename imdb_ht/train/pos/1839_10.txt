An excellent movie about two cops love the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed him, but all the evidence seems to encroach the other (Montand). The sick man does not know who loves the other who could kill him, and Périer does not know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely get the killer ... and what a great end! Very recommended.
