Sentimental and naive but indefinitely-affected, emotional human-help-human prayers, in this case as minor and German minorities forced to be close to one another after the Great War thanks to a new border, leading to despair The German side, as the French are employers. But when a fire begins on the French side, the common wickedness of the German guys leads to assistance, security and even friendship. This was a complaint that would fall into deaf ear of the decade, as a person from the Pabst's own side would break that piece and turn the Great War into merely a prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this fundamental humanist kind, as this film is spread and optimistic in that where more flippant, cynical adaptation of Opera at Threepenny has missed the bite need to do work. Also strengthening its honest beliefs is the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for their positions, but real people, and real families whose home life is private. These are ordinary, working-class people who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating your fellow human rights, and to this day of individual opportunistic, I will take a little thinness of my draw to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all love ... <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently finishing the finish on most prints, where the French rebuild the mining gate, close to guys Once again, a brutal turn of events, and can make a movie a better movie in general, but I'm crazy to suck the vibes positives in the final sequence, so in short, I'm glad it was cut.) {Grade 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) in 1931}
