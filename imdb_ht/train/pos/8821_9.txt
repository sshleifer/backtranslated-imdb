The question is, can a movie this fun really considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I have picked up this in a video store used for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Foto" about it (Vestron was highly regarded as a brand of quality Ever since I first acquired the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We did not expect a movie as full of winning as this one was. Your basic drawings are as follows: Grange, this goombaesque thomba from the planet Earth, robs "the bank of the Moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) to bauxite and other minerals. The "Governor" of the colony said and my owners are exploiting the prisoners to work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's one craft from the whole planet and they would have him deal with. Then there's the nameless "Colonel", a retired Bounty Hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. Many of the film centers around "futurist" chases machines (dunebuggies and plywood slip around them) and exploration galore. Planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of these other dust inside Inside. But what makes the movie really bright is a surprisingly awesome band featuring several LA Punk bands in the mid 80s. I seriously doubted that this band was never pressed into vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the band. I can not even remember the names of the bands (cited in the credits) other than Blast White Mouse, because that was the only one I'd ever heard before I saw this movie, but I definitely wanted to get into them. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.
