"Writing on the wind" is a compelling, beautiful film, as director only Circus could do it. The film is submerged in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, unusual melodrama and colorful contrasts. The connection between financial success and moral corruption is the main theme of the movie. Circus seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to view the movie as a first example of what suggests could be done with kitschy materials. Palette of colors is particularly impressive. Acting in the movie is great too. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an Aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (he deserved to have won the best Oscar commercial support), who managed to keep film in at a boiling point. Kudos and Frank Skinner's pulsating notes, Russell Metty's brilliant camera work (each one shot is a masterpiece in his head), and the production design department. Also, the title melody is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
