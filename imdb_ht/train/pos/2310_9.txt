I was surprised to be surprised by how big the man on the moon really was.I meant the first thing I was to wait a cheese, and predictive film, but I decided to put that sideways when watching. Well, when he was about I was just leaving stunned (especially in tears), by how the great man of the moon turned out. This film is so fun and it is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film. The action was great especially in Reece Witherspoon (which was so beautiful and adorable), and everyone else. nothing that really harassed me, I felt ending the kinda predictable, but very well done in that. Also I felt some thing to be groaning or as if he had done before, but still a great movie. Overall I must I say not much to say about this movie, not that it was bad, just a movie you either love or do not like. I would however recommend this to any and everyone, though you do not like those types film, it's still an enjoyable movie. <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
