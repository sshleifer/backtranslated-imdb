One of John Ford's best films in the 'Informer' does not feature any grand scenery in the Western Americans. Instead, the intense drama drama was known for playing out on the spot with no resistance to the British character Victor McLaglen. The former Prizefighter, who once fought Joe Joe in the ring, delivers an Academy Award winner of IRA soldiers Gypo Nolan in the worst night of his life. The draw is gracefully simple: In 1922, Dublin, a hungry and humiliating man who was cast out of the IRA for being able to kill an informer in the cold, himself became an informer. For Â£ 20 he betrays a friend of the "Tans" and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives his blood money to rapidly alternate spasms of guilt, guilt, self-pity, and desperate desire to save the consequences in his action. <br /> It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo which is the most successful movie success. In most movies there would be a huge draft of Gypo's type to throw like the heavy, it would have at best two or three lines and be willing to quickly for the hero and the villain could confront them. Gypo's 'informateur' himself is both hero and cruel, while the confrontation is in his inner turmoil, all the bit of which is clearly shared with the audience. <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel was filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates, particularly cinematic Joseph H. August, turned this advantage to creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man of war and himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer' also won his first John Ford along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score.
