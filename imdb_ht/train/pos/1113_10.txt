Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women in the world. He began as a stand-up comedy in the 1970's, but his great break came in 1983 when he starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro to excuse the prince's chief, "The King of Comedy". His film career is never well off, though. He made a couple of odd but fun pictures, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts are the ones he created for himself. <br /> <br /> "Without you I do not mind" is undoubtedly the best effort. It's an adaptation of his break-hit him Off-Broadway show that made him a superstar ?? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfect choreographers and scenes scene, Sandra turned out to Nina Simone Diana Ross, talks about his childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performed songs that were made popular by Burt Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich received Sandra making a 90-minute tour-of-force performance that is both sexy and uniquely funny. If you are a Bernhard fan, you can not miss this movie; It's a tribute as well into it (bizarre) beauty as its talent is very original as a comedy. And it has influenza filmmakers in their work ?? "Hedwig and the Inferior Inch", for example, would look a lot different if "without you nothing" did not exist.
