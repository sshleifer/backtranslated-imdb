The Booth puts a whole new twist on your ordinary movie or J-terror. This film puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thoughts. <br /> The story is about the perception of those who are working, life, and the likes of our protagonist, and how he is persecutor who surrounds him in an old radio station station DJ. The story hatched back the layers of the main character as an onion of flash-backs as the movie runs its course, and from it we learned that things are not always the way it looks. The film mostly took place in a small station radio station station from a very bad story, where the main character was forced to broadcast its talk show due to the radio station being in the process of re-locating. It is in this space of prison that this film thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. When our protagonist time can not determine the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghosts or some conspiracy by his co-worker or he was all in his mind. What I like about this movie is that the movie-makers make you see in the eyes of the main character and make you just as paranoid as protagonist did. This film is a very smart, staying rather short 76-minute film.
