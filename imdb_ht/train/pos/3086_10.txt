Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why cancel? The ABC should give it a chance to build a hearing. Throw in (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've ever seen. We need to show more like this that makes viewers feel like they are smart people by minded drones. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
