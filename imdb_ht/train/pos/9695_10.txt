Some people may call a child's "Paulie" movie, but I want to assert that he's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film successfully goes to great lengths to show immigrant behavior in the United States - topicality to the recent debates. Shows a parrot telling a Russian immigrant immigrant (Tony Shalhoub) in how he dug America for his original master, the film tells several stories. There is the elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) whom she befriends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Navy), and others. <br /> In all, it's a very well-done movie. I usually do not expect much of these kinds of movies, but this one is a treat. I certainly recommend it. Also begins Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
