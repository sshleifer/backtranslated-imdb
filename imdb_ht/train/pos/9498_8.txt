"Paint is to see, then remember better than you've seen." So, says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter of the light failed. The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman with a brave braided jealousy including Ida Lupino in his first role, seductive character Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman's condemned.) , with a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the movie pretty much give away the fact that Dick is losing sight of him. It's blind to discharge gun powder as it and little love Maisie (Muriel Angelus) is playing with a pistol. Later a wound during the Battle of Sudan is catalyst for its blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he has already been blinded by ambition, and does not really reach his full potential until he points out to him. Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and it is the destruction itself set in motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays in Colman beautifully. His evil breaks remind me of Bette Davis of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well acted well and directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
