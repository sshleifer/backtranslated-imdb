The latest film by the Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children experience violence and isolation in remote communities, developing into young blonde adults who need certain psychic tools to cope with their mental weakness. If these tools are religions that have followed a fan level, caring for others or simply putting on a macho image while engaging as a gay male, Villaronga creates a successful test of how these screws Affects three adolescents living in Spain under Franco. Three Witnesses disturbing deaths or friends before they are teenagers and buried the emotions they feel with their peers are brittle until they meet once more in a hospital for people suffering from tuberculosis. Cinema style of the text is typically visually uplifting as you would expect of author authority and extremely incredibly aware of Pedro Almodovar's Spanish work and terms related to sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural abundance spliced ​​and realistic claustrophobic, the fiercely opposed use of Almodovar in surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and has violent violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this movie as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing.
