Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, happy, and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a kid and will at times could be back in the days of "good ole" for a while really need to see this one! It starts out as 20 years later, a group of senior comrades return for a "reunion". I will not comment on the plot again cause you have to see it for yourself. The actors were big, and it has a whole star cast. All of it has played a terrific role. You actually felt like you were part of the movie watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good at his role as Uncle Lou. He plays guy types that everyone wants to be in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this one anybody in a heartbeat! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
