Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this year 2003 (late May) and a good improvement over Carrey's past and personally irresponsible past comedy. With a little bit torn down Carrey antique again with just the zap and crack in his old self, Carrey powerful brings this movie to the height of laughs and also some moments dramatically, little trends. The element of Jim's current ability to continue to show off this film. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the jumping moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still missing in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy / drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great dating movie along with a solid and cynical spiritual mental and parody message that keeps its good-natured flavors. Eight out of ten stars.
