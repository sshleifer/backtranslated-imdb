When working in downtown Manhattan, and often eating my lunch during the summer days in the park near City Hall, I would see the mayor come and go. It was great that they could go beyond the doors of City Hall and see what it looked like in the band and out of the whole building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03, provided an exceptional performance in the out-of-the-picture, and especially when he gave a speech to an African American Church for a little boy being killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Judge Runaway", '03, was a dedicated servant of the Mayor and worshiping him in all he had attempted to accomplish. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), began to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gave a great support role. Last, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played a mob boss who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the photo! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in NYC!
