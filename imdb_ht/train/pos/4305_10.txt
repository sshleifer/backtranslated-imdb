Grand Canyon is a very unusual bird. It's a completely completely structured piece, where the plot all would fail to transmit so much. <br /> It's central theme seems to be the uncertainty life of life kept for people of all races, backgrounds and stations. But they claim that the theme of the film should be horribly extinct its dimensions. Similarly, pigeonhole in a particular genre is useless. The movie has merchants say, though likely different traders per viewer, and says it all in a way that does not preach from many angles, which in the end I can not even defines its central message for myself. But it does business with laser accuracy; Each proprietor, line of dialogues, and background music backgrounds contributes to its ubiquitous atmosphere and powerful messages, that I am pleasantly surprised, and come to reflect after every look. Still it does not feel at all butcher. A brilliant film with a great cast and everything working.
