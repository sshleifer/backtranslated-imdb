This particular Joe McDoakes short topic was obviously inspired by all the star warner Brothers Spectacular Thank You Stars Lucky, one of those all winter boosters stars in the period. In that one Eddie Cantor played both his head and a comedy that would like to break into films except for his resemblance to Cantor.

Maybe sounding like a real movie star would help. <br /> <br /> 86 later in the exposition of director Ralph Sanford and the Clyde Cook patient who plays a fantastic British soldier to find a niche in the movie business for poor McDoakes. It is worth seeing this very funny short subject that was nominated for an Oscar to find out what happened to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both of them.
