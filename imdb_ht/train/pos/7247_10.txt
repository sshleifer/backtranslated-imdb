Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars from the city of the living eve (I'm surprised that Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey kid out of dark shadows who want to forget black shadows existed .. .. Anyway, in the EMI Thi video there is no music on the opening credits ... but the music is a great time it comes to ... and the Italian movie cinema are not as good as the music ... my favorite scene is with the boy and the robot arm follow strangely-alien in the desert.A foreigner says why you follow me .. Tommy Answer because I feel like it .. ... Alien replies that way you headed Tommy says West then aliens say well, I'm going to the east .. So after a while in market, the theme will be Play in the background the alien looks up and saw Tommy sitting on a platoon stone a pet hamster ... Tummy looks up and says aliens, what took you lo ntan ... I like this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robot arm needs a father and alien is shooting at Tommy's father in the desert. . . oh yes, they need water too. . . by the WARRIOR ROAD (MAD MAX 2) by any means but a funny western / postfilm nuke with a boy with a robot arm with aliens and garbage with a few other good guys and a chick means with a claw and CRAZY BULL looks like Wez in the Road Warrior. . on Sunday afternoon on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA) after church I would come home and find this on. . . often. . . too often. Love it. 10/10
