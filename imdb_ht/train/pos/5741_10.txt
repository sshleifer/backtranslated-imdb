One of my favorite movies I saw in the Seattle preview. Tom Hulce was amazing, and out words could convey his feelings / thoughts. I actually send Mike Ferrell some donations to help the movie get distributed. It's good. The system says I need more lines, but do not want to give away something drawn. I was at the hearing in Seattle and Hulce and director, a writer I think with Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour later. Not really a dry eye at home. Why Hollywood continues to be stupid I do not know. (Actually I know, it's our fault, look what we look) Well you get what you pay for guys. Find this and see it with a special person. It's a gem.
