This is the best version (so far) that you will see and most true of the Bronte work. Dalton is a bit hard to imagine like Rochester that Jane Eyre declared "not nice". But acting out this battle with Zelah Clark, beautiful as it is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long, but well worth it. Direct direct quotes from the book are in the script, and if you want the first true 'romance' of literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and read it and read it original. The movie may seem a bit dated now but never will have another like this.
