One of the first OVA ("original video animation") I've ever bought, this still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk action comedy created against an easy (for a comedy, which is) background of future pre-emptive pollution in a dystopian society. The "Heroes" of Dominion are the Tanks Police, formed with a "if we can not beat crime, we will get larger weapons" philosophy, and which, as the name suggests, patrol the city of tanks instead of car patrol, and which is actually far more dangerous than any criminal trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these cordons (?) Psycopathic and neurotic, give new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons" .. As colorful and entertaining are the opponents, terrorist Buaku and hench him (high ) The Sisters, Twin Cats, whose existence always seems to involve Police Tanks a tough time. <br /> <br /> The animation is not the state of the art, but it is very nice otherwise; The colorful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and Mecha fit nicely with the comedy atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is, again, very fun. The soundtrack in the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a band album in that ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It is Japanese SF cyberpunk with many comedies, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure he never sued himself. Very recommended.
