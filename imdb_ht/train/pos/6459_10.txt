Back to the roots and "like it in the sky" - what are the real values ​​in life? These swedes write a message that appeals to each heart. We've seen it twice now in a charging movie in the last seat: Love the sooner and joy of the music in a chorus of simple, but full of power once everyone finds tone or inside. <br /> From glitter to fame at the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after falling on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and drawing in life in simple, hot and rough people in the North. <br /> It has the hearts and music and gains the ability of their love and must love unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go see it if you were normally in Hollywood. This stuff has no expense, just laugh, your compassion, tears!
