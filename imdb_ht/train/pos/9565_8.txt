Dog bites dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slip, stabbed and shot (but do not worry? The lead in a terrible shot), it can best be described as a fantastic violin in Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty in her journey, she almost immediately sat down in a big table in the middle of a obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds costly for you, you should probably avoid this movie. She acted as my sign of disbelief, and I was very pleased with her. <br /> Chasing Pang Down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, crazy jinda who likes smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks a fine line with internal investigations, and his father, a Good Cop legend, is in a coma after a drug deal that goes south (the implication is that Wai is leaving his father to rap to deal with its own corruption) <br /> There is a car crash, lots of killings, and a weird strange and awkward story about bidding here, all played out of almost comic book-style. I suspect that the humor was deliberate (nobody used blaggeon gargantuan concrete without an eye to the absurd absurd), even though the over-the-top nature lost a number of members to my fellow audience. There are at least three points where the film can be completed, and in 109 min it can benefit from more corruption correction, or the deletion of one of the narrative threads (things light-hearted worked well, so I'd have left out the interactions with the three ancestors). <br /> I'm inclined to give it a (high) pass, however, if only because of the finish ?? I rarely heard many people laughing so loud at what would be a moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who like the ridiculous
