I almost did not rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.I thought it was just as dark fall that I also love. The only part I was hated about the ferry was two red arms at the gas station. It was funny and the dialogue made me laugh but that was not a comedy. He lost the movie a bit for me because it was needed. The rest of the film was the way a movie horror or thriller would be. The make-up was good and I saw ways to worsen movies then this one. It was a simple story and acting credible. It's not the most creepy or guriest movie, but I did not cook off or want a refund after watching it. On the DVD there were forecasts of other movies that all look good and I'll check them out.
