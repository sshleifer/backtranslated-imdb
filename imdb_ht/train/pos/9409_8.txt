A store develops a fabric that never gets dirty or out, but it is seen as a threat to survival in various industries. In this delightful Ealing Studios comedy, Guinness is wonderful as the mild but persistent shirt. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, playing the love interest; Parker is her father. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch of the fabric industry. While telling a story is engaging, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, the economy, and politics. It is adequately directed by Mackendrick, who would go on doing the "Ladykillers" and the Sublime "Sweetness of Success" later in the 1950s.
