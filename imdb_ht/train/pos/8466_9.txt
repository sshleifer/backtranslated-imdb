Like TALK RADIO, the BOOTH is actually something predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in, the BOOTH because of - let's face it - the genre and the basic set-up). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. That is, in essence, that the filmmakers do not punk out in the end way they might have been in, say, an American version of this story. The BOOTH moves unbeatable toward its (foregone) conclusion, but is thus very well manufactured on every level that one can enjoy the ride so a cruise can be accustomed to a well-traveled stretch of (very scenic) road. She reminded me of Spanky's brief story of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Klostrophobi is, at times, almost inconspicuous. Send a nice long look.
