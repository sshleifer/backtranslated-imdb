I barely remember this show, a little, but I remember it was great! My older brother, reminded me of the show recently and I saw an advertisement for wearing D.V.D coming out. The network, again screwing up at pulling this from the air, so that they could put that stuff in it's place? It should go at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think sometimes network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. But they mis-guess and flatten out missing placement shows good from time to time. Let's say that, they have a lot more flops than 'hit'. This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up. Whatever, I get this for my collection.
