This is one of the movies that you come across when you are browsing channel about a Saturday afternoon, and you get drawn to it and finish watching it all. I thought it was well-done and it really made me feel for the characters. Even though it's a bit slow moving, focusing on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and family members, she never got bored. We do not really see too much of all the flights that are so legendary, and rather most of the shootouts take place when they are ambushed by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a great job with her character. Going out of a beautiful country girl in a cold-blooded assassin is something hard to show, and I enjoyed the intricacies it brings to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, a higher average effort, especially considering being a made for TV movie.
