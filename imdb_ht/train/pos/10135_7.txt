What begins as a very predictable affair with a bit drab is at the end quite hilarious and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very thrilling but it's more than done with that of some foreign set pieces and top gorts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Playing the character in a great "aloof" fashion, you almost feel bad for the guy to the end when his grand plan finally fails. Corbin Bernsen also grows the landscape playing a non-good-guy-who gets his just dessert. <br /> <br /> End Spoiler. <br /> As a revenge-from-dead cops, "the right to die" heavily benefits from his performers and is more than a OK way to spend less than an hour.
