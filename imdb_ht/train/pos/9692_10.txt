I do not know who might find fault with a simply humorous and humorous movie like this and lots of fun for your heart. I enjoyed every minute of it and guessed the half way finished in the movie - but that did not disappoint me at all. It will not only touch your heart but it's like a good family movie movie - we need more like that!
