I wonder anyone who says they do not care for this movie. Some reviews have said he had not had enough stocks, some said he was too long, etc. do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> Performance to act is superb! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all supported and Liam Neeson is doing a workable job and is a very imposing character because of his size. The cinematography was brilliant and breathtaking. It is you in the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that was virtually impeccable from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. Press <br /> <br /> I was amazed this in the top 50 or 100 movies to review. I felt so passionate about it that I just registered with IMDB so I could let everyone know the real scoop. I saw this film about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone liked it! You must wake up and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they feature quite a few characters from the beginning. If you have the attention span longer than most of these kids review kids for the movies on this site, than you'll love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lords of the ring cinema at the top 9 and the Matrix in # 32?!?! This should show the age of most reviews here! <br /> This is a top 50 movie !!!
