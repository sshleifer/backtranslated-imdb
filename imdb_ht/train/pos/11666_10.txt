SECRET OF KELLS can be the most exquisite movie I've seen since the TRIPLETS in BELLEVILLE. Although very different styles, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (jaws open to 2D sequences) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a color richness that is a must for one's sense. KELLS is so fabulous - almost gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), beautifully flat overall perspective, ornaments of Celtic design & illuminated, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing - AK it all works together pretty well. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are to draw in every detail of the story and at each congestion of the pencil & brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and all of the drawing saloon (& Extended Team) have been achieved with this small budget / VERY small movie, is absolutely surprising. Embassy support among our animation community is phenomenal. This film is enchanting with the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this movie is spreading like fire fire. Congratulations to KELLS on its hug, its Annie nomination as well as its current Oscar qualified race. They all very well worth the nods, indeed ...
