Julie Waters is still wonderful but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation of this comic-comedy comic bent on a transvestite who can not suppress his mania, and the changes he goes through when he's discovered. Unerringly eschews vulgar, easy jokes to understand genuine and true insight, and having an absolute ball while doing it. A very nice, low-key, feel-good, comedy
