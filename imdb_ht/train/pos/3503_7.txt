If you always remember the summer when you first kissed you, first boy / girlfriend, or first puppy loves to throw ... this movie is for you! OK for this movie and never got an Oscar but as a Dominic I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that might just go right on yourself if you're not part of the culture ... the kids being raised by a grandmother in both mom and dad, the youngest boy being baby and bathing with a bust of Bustelo Cafe (Soho Dominique!), Judy being harassed by people in the neighborhood, go to church with lighting a prayer candle ... The bright film was in those small details. Granted, it was not a pull out everything Cinematic extravaganza but it was not meant to be NOR it was meant to be an educational tool for people who want to learn about Latin culture (tip: make new friends instead) . More in a bitter-sweet, faux-cumentery, this movie keeps it real without taking it too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" this was simply a boy coming to age history. I recommend it (especially if it is Dominicano!) = O)
