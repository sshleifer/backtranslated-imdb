The guys can slave on Lollo, if they like (or lollos - he gave his name to a slang for French breast), but the ladies have a putty flavor of Gerard Philipe's wine, which is not only beautiful but can be act. Do not be discouraged if your version has no translation because of this simple, superbly story of love and war, in which all is fair, they do not need. All you need to know is that, at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells her she's going to marry the daughter of the king. And the story is quite plain from the Gallic gestures with the run, jumping, and swordplay. On the less side, obviously in the story with the heavy-weight facettiousness of the tone becomes somewhat lost, and it is harassed that the French apparently consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to even try plausibility in its exciting exhibit. And of course the non-French speakers lack the occasional bit of the ooh-like, such as: beautiful girls: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: dear, what do you think I was interested in that bag?
