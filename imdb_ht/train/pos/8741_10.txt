"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy - it's shock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty. The story could not have been better; It's smart, there's "heart" (emotion), and each character has a nice "arc" (a growth or change). By comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" have an "arc" to Buzz, who learn to love being a game, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment to buzz. There are tons of laughs and nice moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors turn into great voices, and the animation, both the movement and detail, are superb. This serious movie scrub is not cast around "10" lightly, but this film certainly deserves "10" I gave it.
