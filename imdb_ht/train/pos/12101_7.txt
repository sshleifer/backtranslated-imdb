I remember seeing this movie in the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The scene where Dr. Carmus found the coffin field, and the body died evenly in it, was the horrible part of the film for me, only intensified by the darkness of the movie. I also asked about the people hanging from the trees in the end until I recognized the part of the movie in which the family name of Blackwoods had changed from Blackblood, due to the fact that in the family history there was a character was known for many hangings in various types. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kick off from adding to the deaths caused by his family. I even notice that as Foster first entered the gateway to the cemetery, it is the attention of noticing the sharp object of the gate, where it meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to movie horror movie lovers.
