As a longtime Barbra fan, any posting as this will be partial. That aside, this movie was as a classic. It had it in flaws (highlighted in other posters), but it gave a glimpse of a late (70) time that will never be there, and it is fascinating to look up on screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make her own movie. I do not think he's ever satisfied. But he gives his fans a new Barbra (for the time) and LIVE songs, a young cool appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting. <br /> <br /> The story is rough, but interesting, and keep your interest at all. A prolonged "final" frame is difficult for most people not Barbra fans to sit, but it speaks to traders who admire his talent. <br /> <br />
