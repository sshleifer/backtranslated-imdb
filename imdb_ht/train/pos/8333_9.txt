IQ is a beautiful romantic comic book that deepens the deepest and profound scientific thinking of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted film again thoughtful. You do not quite know how to react because part of the time you will see big scientists doing the funny things to nurture budding love, but in other times you hear to discuss some of the deepest puzzles in space / time at age our. The end result is a fun movie with surprises at all. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates an original, spread-brained, or-matched origin, with Tim Robbins bringing in life the contradictions of a poorly educated person who is captured by science. Together, they create a farcical journey of love and science, mind and heart.
