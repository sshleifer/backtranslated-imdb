I used to watch this show when I was a girl. Although I do not remember much about it, I must say it was a very good show. Also, I do not think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it's always a good show. I vague remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally disposed, the costume design was great. Their performance was top-grade, too. I just hope that some networks bring this series back one day so that I'll be able to see every episode. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, though I do not think I've seen every episode. Now, at the conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back into the air, I hope you catch it one day before it goes to the air for good.
