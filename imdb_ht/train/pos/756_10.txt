I said although I despise these kinds of shows, horror horror, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Sanchez room before I saw Jackass and think it way Jackass surpasses the terms of the program. The story lines and inter interviews weaved to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jackass films in the night of another and could not believe how bad she herself was, everything just put in a line joke after jokes with no relationship between anything. It has to be shown in the fastest ever easier to edit, amateur shocking. While poking drink is not really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, Sanchez's room is a way out of Jackass's league.
