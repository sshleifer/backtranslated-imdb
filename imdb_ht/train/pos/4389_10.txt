From the excellent of a very impressive cast, in the intelligently written script (and highly quotable), from the lively cinema of the beautiful music note by Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity of movie going experiment: one that is Impressions are impossible to find faulty and in any area. <br /> There were several comparisons made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all credit due to Mel Gibson, Braveheart has struck me as too much of a self-conscious epic and racist Rob Roy preachy as the kind of movie I would care to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious season, Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs you in telling her tight story. Not a single scene wasted. Rob Roy has the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. Characters are quite smoky-out, perfectly transmitting newspapers and styling that drives the anchor into the native period settings. <br /> <br /> Further, not the good and evil caricatures as we are all too often observed in modern films For example, while we expect Rob Roy's hero to prioritize, we realize his predicament to producing in his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful guys in cinema history, but there are moments when we can understand how the events in his life formed him to become what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes his story even more credible and entertaining. Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword ever-ever choreographers and a climatic end up being worthy of anticipation.
