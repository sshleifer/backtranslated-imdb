I really remember seeing this when I was 3 years old, then my parents accidentally stuck on all, but a few seconds in it with some other cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since then I could understand better things, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-discover it thanks to some web / video clips articles and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's always good with the kids, but our 20-30 somethings it definitely got "Kilt Status" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production goes through a painful process; if Fox has given it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they should notice it with a totally different story and a voice all thrown stars it might be, but that's for Fox to decide. I rambling here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it might be better than big.
