This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the boring person I've seen in years. Its routine is hilarious and makes for great conversations with others who have seen it. I strongly recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slower, but the jokes end up in the French are good, because you do not need to speak French to get it (although if you do, it's still hilarious). Also, parties on being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but the funny first time. Jump over those people if you can. It's almost not worth seeing. However, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
