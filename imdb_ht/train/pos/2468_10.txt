I went to see Hamlet because I was in between working. I figured 4 hours would be great, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead again, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, acting, cinematography that this film captured. Like other 4-hour reviews, they pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, it's Hamlet, it's designed for that. When I watched this movie I'm still trying to find faults, I looked at the goofs and did not notice them. How could it be to move the camera in and out of the Hall and all the mirrors is a mystery. This film was shot at 70 miles. It's a shame that Columbia has not released a screen version on this on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I would take this on Titanic any day. So, Columbia if you're listening to putting this movie out of how it should look! And I do not know what happened to the Oscars. This should sweep best pictures, best actors, best guides, best movies. Which films were watching? I was sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have given a tribute to Branagh to bring us one of the greatest films of all time.
