The barriers seem to be one of the series that was lost in the temples in time. After its transmission of the early 80s and a repeat, it's been since blood flow. This is a weeping cry. <br /> I originally watched this when it was transmitted to the South TV region on Sunday afternoon and it was classic te-tan viewing. Although I do not remember a great deal about the program, something is stuck in my mind. Most remarkable were the unforgettable titles. The sweet flotty music accompanies the escape attempt across a European border and subsequent crash crashes (and that scene left me with a respectable love of 'fintail' models as they used a Merc 200). Although it was not evident at the beginning, the solution to the mystery series was at the headlines. The draw on a young student student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovered he had adopted lots of twists and turns but Barrier was an amazing drama 'adult' children. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and was a shame he did not do much more. <br /> This was a quality drama, quite late for a DVD release and I hope I'll get the chance to re-know myself with it in the future. <br /> A fond memory of my childhood
