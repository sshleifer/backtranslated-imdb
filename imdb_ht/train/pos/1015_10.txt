I wait for each new episode, each re-run and anticipation! The new Sci-Fi look created by Stargate SG-1 is an amazing one that I hope never ends. Combining the past and the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season # 9 should be a thrill in itself. Hopefully Richard Dean Anderson would show more often in the new season, as I like to understand her circle as much as her temperative tone of her character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a greater role for the asgard - they are just too cool.
