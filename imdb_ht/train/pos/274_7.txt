I watch most movies that Nick Mancuso is in because, frankly, I love the guy, though his age is usually disposed as baddie (long time fans should remember that he is for some blonde reason in this flick film). It's a fairly familiar movie in terms of draw (but then most movies these days are not exactly original), but Rick Roberts is appealing to the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is equally appealing as the daughter , and Mitzi Kapture did a great job, if that were his purpose, to be angry and sometimes very hard to love. Nick always had it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place on screen - such as motivation, previous behaviors, good weather and weather - and apparently apparent things the characters never make it to the audience (so i). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in "but what about ..." category, and in general I can not say that I care so much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was - a reasonably-needed way to spend the afternoon - and I still love Nick.
