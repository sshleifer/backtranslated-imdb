I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was a reason, but the theme keeps on dreaming to talk to me. People talk about it as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers that come in terms of aging, disadvantaged parents, our own mortality, our kids are growing and leaving us, and everybody else Things we never thought would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into the tragedy trap; it's about living your dream means when you have a real life. Quaid is too small for a jug but it makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife of a thoughtful, coherent performance. The camera-work is slow and sweet. When this movie was put together, they left nothing unnecessary. Very nice.
