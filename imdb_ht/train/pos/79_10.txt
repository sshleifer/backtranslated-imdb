I loved the Mc Coys Real Estate (1957-1963) It's too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and does not appear. It was excellent at the show. Naturally Walter Brennan was great as well as Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Grampa.I bought my season on DVD and I can not wait to buy season 2-6. If only there would be more TV shows like this one, everything would be best . This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the members left in the cast and please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known again to the public. You love and respect. Mc Coys's real estate is live forever.
