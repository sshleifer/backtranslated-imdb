I love horses and admire but animated animation, so I hope there is nothing short of surprised from Dreamweaver's new animated Spirit Picture: Stallion of the Cimarron. I guess you might say I was a little disappointed. You have nice animation and at first what looks like a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. The animals do not sing beautiful or even talk - a bigger one. Unfortunately, the movie has a uncalled storytelling by Matt Damon; a soundtrack band by Bryan Adams; and stage actions enough to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the movie makers would have just stayed with simplicity, we would have a prince here. This is not a big movie, but it is good entertainment for small children. I would recommend this movie to family because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there now is not offensive to small children. Not bad, but could be better. Very nice visual though.
