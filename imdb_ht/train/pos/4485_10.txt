This is my favorite of oldest Tom & Jerry cartoon animated from the early 40's. The original version with Mammy De Shoes is on the Tom & Jerry Collection Spotlight 2, one disc, and wonderful animation in detail in the cartoons early. The gags on this one are not all modern Avery style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who ever lived late watching movie scary (or radio programs)! Tom is listening to a creepy radio show, and Jerry decided to play a number of tricks on it. The nine-life gag well done here, and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum with a scary leaf when I was a kid. When Tom's owner got up in the ruckus - Mammy was not the maid, he was home - he became one heck of a surprise, with a big laugh. Get your paused button, it's worth it!
