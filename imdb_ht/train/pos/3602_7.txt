While the story of a troubled kid turning into boxing for self-respect and anger management is hardly something new, the story is given a cool twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy . Diana has problems at school. It just can not stay away from battle. In her father's house she is still wearing her. His brother is doing boxing in a gym and one day when he chooses him up and decides he also wants to train. <br /> It would be easy to call this movie a "Rocky and Girl" I guess. But that's not all that this is about. The story actually benefits much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy. In this way you can deal with more problems at once. The first problem in it was not accepted because it's not a girlie girl, and then when it comes to gym in boxing because it's a girl at all. It is also a story about how a purpose may change some life in life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want this sound pretense, because the movie does not feel pretended to all, but I say it is true. <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the lead. It's really a shame that she gets stuck in the typecasting's "hard girl" now, because that's really not her part of "Girlfight" is all about. Make sure she is a female boxer, but rather it's the most sensitive moments that really make her bright. So maybe this is basically telling your average story with a twist, but it has got way above the crowd by Rodriguez's performance. I missed this 7/10.
