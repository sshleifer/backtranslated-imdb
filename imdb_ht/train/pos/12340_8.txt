There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mysterious movie - Farrell looks good in his title role, but it reads the line, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from which they have been credited as the first film that makes use of projection. Groups look fry. <br /> There are two great forces in this show, however: although the hype reading dialogue, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, little remembered today: especially for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cuts off the programmer EAST OF BORNEO simply punches in it: Melford credit's visual direction in the original. Its great beauty and simple (despite stagy) performance help to repair some of the damage to the ground-bound sections of this movie. However, one of Borzage's terms is the mystical power of love, and it touches the heavenly celestial sections that make this great, from reaching the celestial train to the journey of the 'Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. So we have here a broken, but very interesting version. I think the version 1934 Language is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the famed-renowned music renown. But I still enjoy this version and think you should give it a chance.
