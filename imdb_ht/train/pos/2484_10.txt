Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli, and Almerayeda have all headed Hamlet but Branagh is the only one who got it right. This is the only film of "Hamlet" that has four hours full of William Shakespeare's Chief and provides a unique sense of the whole story. Not many directors could pull this without boring their audience but Branagh's use of brave movie style and cascade casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that they usually cut out. This example includes Gerard Depardue as Ranialdo whos the whole goal in the movie was simply to say "yes my master" as Polonius asked him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as the actor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> It's a scene that literally made me want to jump from my seat and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the maker film only that understands the importance of each stage of this movie and knew how to convey the importance of the general audience. <br /> This is a must see for everyone who likes good story telling, brilliant acting, and incredible direction. All these parts of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
