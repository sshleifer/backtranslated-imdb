It's rare that I sit in front of the TV especially to watch a particular program. It's even harder when I actually enjoy the program at the end, but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies I think I've seen. <br /> A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, with an excellent, witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can not really express how good I thought it was, so I will not try, I'll just say, if you get the opportunity, PLEASE see it !!!! I only hope it comes out on video.
