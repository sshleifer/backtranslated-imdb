Director Otto Preminger reunited with Laura Dana Andrews's stars and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to roar movie noir: Where the Sidewalk ends. This movie completes with a well-written crime history and exciting characters, unexpected turns, and intelligent dialogue with an eye-fun look and great camera motion with dark and fearless movie noir lighting. Dana Andrews star as Mark Dixon Detective, mobster party and cop party, who have a reputation for being too physically challenging with criminals. After one can see Dixon in search of suspicion and response, he gets far more involved than he wants. Dana Andrews is terrific in her role - hard and edgy, Andrews' Dixon is ready to hit any and all off the heels if found on the bad side. It's the perfect net anti-hero movie - it's not very nice all the time, but we're still rooting for him. Gene Tierney has a solid job in his role, as much as he is, was a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There would not be too much in the Tierney roles, but it certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out and smiling his style, gentle ways, and twinkle in his eyes. Throwing in support is not too bad either - Karl Malden being the most memorable, strengthening and providing a good performance supported as Lyetnan Thomas. Where the end of Sidewalk is not Laura, but it's a big movie full of great characters, stories, and photos.
