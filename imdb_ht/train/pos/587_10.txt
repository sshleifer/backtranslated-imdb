One of the things on the movie that warms my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my liver in dry flying fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brothers and our fathers over a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the trout Everlasting elusive Brown rose and took the fly that offered them. When we had occasion like this any difference between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of them was absorbed in the activity and environment of the place we were in. <br /> This was one of the amazing things that was described to me in the movie as the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly carried out the ceremony. To have something ritualist about flying fishing as there is something ritualist over many periods of time. You can not just begin to drop your fishing line and hope for the better. You have to reach yourself in the place you have, you have to scan the surface of the water to consider how it flows and where the best point can be in place of your fly and, depending on your skill level, or might even get you Flying to land has long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. The 'fly-fishing art' has ruled and represented so well that they can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title for the movie might not be more just chosen, so the river made in fact run into the life of dad and two sons. This film however spreads itself wider than the family and the community of Montana, by the Blackfoot River, where the film is played out. It has the ability to trace you, enthrall you, take you, as the family history, the community and the unfolded period. The story said not only a family history, but a life story. What can be classified as a 'River of Life'
