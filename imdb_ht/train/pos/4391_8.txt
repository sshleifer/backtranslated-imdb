You are waiting to see if the notion is better or worse. I rated the movie Murphy Audie a 3 (I'm a harsh graduate), the second I've ever given to Audie (the worst being "Battle of Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a harsh class) is the civil war's history of renegade "soldier", if you want to call that, against the North. People like Quantrell, and the guys are riding with those out there. <br /> <br /> The original is a water version, very cut off, while still describing the horror of what these guys did. Actually, movies like the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discover the story. I would more to rate the original R "R" with this one, and the nature of her gray piece, a GP, because the newer film gives a very honest version, an easier message deciphered by a youthful than the version older. > <br /> Movie maker since the early sixties had a lot about "Realism", but some of them delivered. Instead, they just provide the drab landscape, drab costumes, and drab events, but with funny characters character stereotypes character, weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern movie makers have realized this mistake. It is obvious to a Western style we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives realistic environments, but also gives us the character we can believe in that era. <br /> It has a few lulls, making a complete site in a bit tough, and it has some unexplored situations. But unrealistic situations are okay as long as the entire movie keeps up, and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> It starts a small farmer, but really improves. The main character is one we can identify, and at least some sympathy for. Odi Murphy characters from the early film really recalls no sympathy, and it is too selfish to upright without motivation. The character of this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is motivation, and a method of frenzy. We never felt it really "right", but we can understand where it came from. <br /> There are many actions in the movie. There are also some humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero he would not lie to him, and he mulls on. <br /> <br /> This film succeeds in doing what movie makers have been trying to do for decades. This director and team writer received it right. <br /> <br /> Recommend. Complete Success.
