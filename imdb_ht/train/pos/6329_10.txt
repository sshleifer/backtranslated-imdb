The cult film for every true Russian intellectuals. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's beyond any praise. The movie, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite one is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (Russian word spell for "devastation", often wanting period of form chaos after 1918-20 Civil War) - wide - open the door to squeaking the brick walls of the snowy snow and the pitch-black hole in the door behind it. Now the movie is released on DVD and completely restores images with the 5.1 sound, has well translated English subtitles also, though some obscene words in Sharikov have been replaced by the most serious versions of the translation. I do not know that DVD is available abroad but if you get it grab it immediately, it's really worth watching. <br /> And at the conclusion, a fact: About 50% of Russia today, especially young, can be identified as Sharikovs in a considerable degree. The post-Soviet effect is: the Soviet people seemed to be completely prepared for the attack information in western civilization, TV producers and movie makers made the entertainment industry, with the mass media massively aggressive, soulless and thought it abetted the worst instinct of every Russian. Even among Internet users every third one uses the obscene language of forums and chats because it's amazingly common in conversation conversations.
