Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry is the best cartoon for Halloween. I know he dosen't have a lot of creepiness, but there's the 'trick' as in "trick or treat," as Jerry did Tom and blind the window with the vacuum-cleaner and a collared-shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost; but still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short, Tom listened to the "Witching Hour," a fantom-story program on the radio, and was frightened by the horror story told. Half of the story, the dramatic (hair standing on the end, the good heart of the throat, spine mirror on the spine) begins happening Tom. . . literally. And Jerry has been observing everything and laughing at himself, thought he wasted Tom not frightening. <br /> I like the finish, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom Attack Mammy De Shoes; The others were the Lonesome Mouse, a mouse in the house and nit-witty Kitty. Also, this short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom speaks. Others are the Lonesome Mouse, the Zoot Cat, Cat in Million Dollars, Bodyguard, Mouse Problems, The Mouse Comes To Dinner, Quietly Happy!, Happy Shades, Solid Serenad, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, mouse mouse, and the cat above and the mouse below is directed by Chuck Jones.
