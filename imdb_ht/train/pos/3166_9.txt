This show has happened so far. At first all of the cast from Eric Fez, were all new actors and actresses, face fare, and just looked at what they accomplished. They are stuck with the show and it was a success. One of the best shows ever made and probably the funniest site I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it ends, but if they finish this show, I hope God's final series goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any final season ever has. I do not care if the whole season absorbs because they save the gas for the final episode. Go down swing, get a last punch in the show worthy of it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, as on friends, and let the final be great. I tell Donna and Eric, I say that Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say there is something interesting between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but of course he is working for it. Just shut out the great GUY series! <br /> That 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best! <br /> 10/10 ...
