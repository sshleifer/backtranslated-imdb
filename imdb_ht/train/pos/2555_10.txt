The film was not all that great. The book is better. But the movie was not all wrong either. It was interesting to say the least. The plot had enough suspension to keep me watching although I would not say I was actually interested in the movie itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr is both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :) They have a few nice scenes that should appeal to the boyfriend. In general I would give the movie a 7 or 8. It was not bad, Just a little lacking conspiracy.
