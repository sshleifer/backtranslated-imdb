If you liked Long Way Round you will enjoy this almost as much. It is educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two exciting teammates, two tired mechanics, excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes some appearances but Charley really pulls her alone. It's funny, engaging and still a little cool in stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> The series ends up in 7 episodes. Like LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Even though they cover the ins and outs of the race well, there might be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars, which are simply mentioned and rarely even seen racing. It's a motorcycle movie though with anyone on two wheels will love this. <br /> <br /> The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of mouth. Yikes. There is another very catchy song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US God knows when it will drop to buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh, and you must prepare to buy another motorcycle.
