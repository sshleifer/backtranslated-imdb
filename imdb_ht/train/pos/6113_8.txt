After seeing "married Mafia", I would almost lose my faith in the Korean movie business. But this one made my faith come back. <br /> Leading female characters who are university students are forced to teach the guy but the rich but charismatic high school students. It is the current female character's character. Through some hilarious array, these two end have been great friends. <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that New Won song woo has done his job with excellence. It was like a revelation! Actress Kim Haul was also good as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried hard to avoid any clicks that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And he did not show us any necessary naked, sex scenes. It was brilliant, beautiful, cool, and I want to see him again. <br /> <br />
