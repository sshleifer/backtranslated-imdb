This west is done in a different way than most other people. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his hips. How this is presented to make for a most interesting slice of Americana. I'd rather see it on the big screen rather than on tapes, but it's worth a look to see just how life was back to the real west. Cinema is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell Glitter in This Movie.
