If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast, with a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing season and a great joy of watching TV after dinner. With the constant change of relations and finding out that Hyde's real father, this show was a hit when he started in August of 98, though he was set in 1976. And hanging out of the basement Foremans was always the thing do back then and still is today, along with circles. This show was given great laugh at prime minister, and it still does during re-run. If you look at a few episodes of this show, you will find everything and want to get more. Now only this shows one of the best ever created, it is smart and funny.
