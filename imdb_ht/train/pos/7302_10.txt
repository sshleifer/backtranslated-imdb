As this writes' Halloween Halloween John Carpenter is nearing its 30th anniversary. It has since been allegedly 7 sequel, a remake, a whole mess of imitation and every year around Halloween when they do those 'Top 10 scenarios' list is still over there. That's quite amazing for a movie that's made a budget of around $ 300,000 with a feat then almost completely dropping the gender up and coming young talent. I could go over and over, but the big question here is: How the movie holds today What a wonderful, but spooky opening credit sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable score and goosebump-inducing by the director / co- John Carpenter and Alan Howarth writers Director of Carpenter, which maintains the high suspension, gets some big shots, and he is careful not to show too much of his bad ones. Good performance from the cast then mostly Sex is a good sense of humor. "Michael Myers is one of the worst, evil guys, a lot of strange moments that will stay with you. It is slow but steady and never shoots. Unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and horror than blood and a large body count. <br /> <br /> Account: Probably not nearly as frightening now as it was then. Many of the goofs really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know that is not a popular opinion, but it's really how I feel. Although it really is an important movie that holds the new generation of film films. And just because it has been restored to a new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. There is no way, there is no way. <br /> Rating: 5/5
