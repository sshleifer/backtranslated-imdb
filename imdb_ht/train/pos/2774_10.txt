For my movies and acting is all about telling a story. History of David and Beth-sheba is a profound tragedy and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this movie I thought the story by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was at their best. To know and understand the history of David and his journey to become King of Israel, this story was all the more compelling. You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human side of that person in his time was bigger than life. Susan Hayward was frightened, reluctant, but then obedience to her authority as her king was very well portrayed by her. One could also feel the sorrow of David near Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as the sadness when he died in battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and conviction authority in the king made me feel his anger. The appliances were real enough, and the atmosphere was credible. All in all I think this was one of the best movies in his style. I gave it a rating of ten.
