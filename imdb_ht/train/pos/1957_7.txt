Yes I'll say before I start commenting, this movie is incredibly confused. Sharon Stone is great in his role in Catherine Trammell as Morrissey as Dr. Worm. It is an analyst sent to assess it after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn in a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. The act was good (apart from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. It's slick, naughty and seductive and does not look a day longer than it did in the first. It really impressed me (as in casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed many dererablitity in a role that needed it. Thewolf however was nursed. He ruined his character, he was over-the-top all the way. She really sucks. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not as good as the first, but Stone is a hood to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
