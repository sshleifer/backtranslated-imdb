I initially bought this DVD because it was SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, little I knew that Aishwarya would only appear in an article number in the latest episode of the movie in a song that he shared with SRK and helped to present his character in the movie for about just 15 minutes. Shakti is a movie about love of a mother and endurance. It's a film about transformation, ignorance, coming to age, leaving in the knowledge and embracing the harsh realities of life. The article number in which SRK and Aishu appear to have nothing to do with the movie. It is actually a dream sequence that occurs while the SRK's drunk character strikes without knowledge of bottles. She dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl showing up in her favorite hangout one day, dressing scantily and beginning to seduce her. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (wounds translated as "love a bitch!") And it's just plain quirky hot! Do not miss it.
