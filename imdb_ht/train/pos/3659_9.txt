This movie was first to touch me with Mr Sica so I really did not know what to expect. But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a great way. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not complex and shows us a life found boy - orphan and particularly his connection to the community of the poor who together built themselves a hood in simple metal plates. This little town in another city lives clean lives and things will be fine. But one day there is a water resources found with a wealthy man who is getting interested in buying the place. But as the title of the movie suggestions - there is a miracle taking place. Our character becomes a dazzling dove from his mother dies. What will he do to protect his friends and cities that are built too? <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. There are people showing poor behavior and how money and property can talk and play with people. Also many funny moments and scenes are included - at the beginning and the place where bright sunshine and many more. <br /> So, according to the fact that I'm not a comedy lover you should see this movie because I love it so much <br />
