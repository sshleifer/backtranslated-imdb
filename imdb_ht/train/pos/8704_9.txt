There are a lot of crap out of Hollywood lately. A friend, send me movies now and again, as a surprise, it's awesome. <br /> I turned it over and could not stop watching, it's a drama but with an odd twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian movie, telling stories that are not about explosions and big cgi. It takes a simple basic quote and tells a story, without a spectacle. This is a lot like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. It's not perfect, but nothing ever. You know what the power is but never explained, nor totally realized until the end. It gets high in the emotion of the story. I do not want to see a rumor, it's too cool as it is, the Hollywood system would, as usual, mess it up. Acting is the headache all around. Direct and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. The Kudos all involved, and I will turn many people over this independent season. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, look at it.
