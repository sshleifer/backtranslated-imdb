Sports movies have never been my stuff, but a handful of them work for me. The best are those who focus less on the sport and more about the character, such as the Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great first director for Karyn Kusama, with an outstanding performance first for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels it's both realistic and involving, that's enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The draw is strangely forward enough. Diana Guzman, is in his fourth year at high school, but due to his picking battle in the hallway he is close to expulsion. As a possible way of anger, it's a sign of Boxing lessons at the club where his brother is training (at the will of having dad). In the course of ninety minutes, our viewers saw something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changed from a girl to a woman. We see it in his body as well as his behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club finds himself drawn on it, and he gets into it. There is not a bad scene or a moment that moves / clashes in the movie. Only the error that I might be able to correct is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note. Aside from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
