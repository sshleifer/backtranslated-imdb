My wife and I looked at this series at least three times. I can not imagine how it would be best. This is not the "complete" story of WWII ?? no library could hold such a story ?? but it is the best summary of this story. Many details, many of personal stories, and always keep the picture in general in view. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is excellent writing and, of course, superbly given. Interviews are from everywhere, except the Russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very much worth to have this complete program on DVD. We copy our copy. The producer does an excellent job of providing photos and actions where there was almost no old one in any archive: There is almost no film of convoy and submarine battles, for example, but still, the episode on the topic is very well done.
