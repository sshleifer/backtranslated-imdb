As a longtime fan of the greatest creation of Peter O'Donnell, I watched this movie on DVD with no great hope of fun; I really hope to be able to get rid of the remote control in fifteen minutes. But instead I was enjoying this production, and I was especially enjoying and appreciating how producers and directors succeed in telling Blaise's modest story. They managed to avoid the trap to make a (bad) movie version of the books we all are so familiar with, choosing instead to focus on a period of modesty's life just announced in the novels. for their production value (and I do not have any students in cinematography!): Yes, the movie was filmed about a tight financial and budgetary time and perhaps showing ... but it spoils the player's fun? In this case I think not. Instead we are presented in one of the world's greatest literary characters and give a taste to their abilities. <br /> <br /> In consequence of the casting: because we are just familiar to the people who really have problems are modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me, they were totally credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be an action heroine, brought to Modesty's screen poise and calm; His technique (when martial arts were needed), but more importantly personal integrity of which is at the Canon's core of Blaise's modesty. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know this movie was produced by Miramax's claim to Modesty Blaise characters, he did quickly and cheaply, but ... I for one can not wait to see The next production of this series by these producers - as long as they are kept in the basic values ​​and characteristics of their original story!
