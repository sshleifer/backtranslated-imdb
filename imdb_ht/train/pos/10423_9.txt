Yes, to make my love was Skyrocket Mario Lanza's fame and always popular today. His voice was strong and fixed, so powerful in fact that MGM decided to use it in the Great Caruso. His head thought it was reincarnation in Caruso. Having read the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, she explained that the constant practice and vocal lessons became Visionary Caruso in Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza has done a superb job of the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on Hollywood! I've been practicing singing songs since years ago, and it has become very good to myself until I lose my voice because of empowerment / asthma ten years ago. The high score in my love is not easy; but nice!
