This is a great movie. If this is any indication, than Hong Sang-Soo really is "the best Asian seafood keeps secret." It is very similar in the style of Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers a lot of soil as they are thermally, but I think I actually enjoy this plus as a whole than any single one of these films . The open minimalist is a little less pronounced here than in the works, although it still fully fits that style (the camera never moves once), and somehow I found the movie less self-awareness "slow "than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-hsien, which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus, it does not keep its subject well as tear as Hou does. I felt like the movie was also somehow more "filling" and less open (just barely) than some of their jobs, although this does not mean he had much of anything resembling a forward- is moving. I would have a hard time believing that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "losing in translation" (scene of a young woman wandering in her head, and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk punk can not help, but looks familiar).
