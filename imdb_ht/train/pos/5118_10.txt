******** Spoilers - Care ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm partial when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and looked it countless times - and usually find out something new about it and every look. <br /> I think one of the things I love about is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people, not rich people living in either LA or New York. Well, it's true except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a little boy boy Texas who moved to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is when Travolta actually played in good drama movie like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing bad stereotypes guy / good guys at big budget movies. This is a really good movie - the bull competition rival competition and two-stage dancing can be funny, but you have to enjoy this for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud satisfy Sisi (played by Debra Winger and Slutty Clippers) - and soon after, they are married to living in dream trailers. But their relationship becomes a real-life fight in their sex. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to do with a real cowboy. But in modern times, the role of the man is not as clear. Where can Bud prove that it is a real man? It can work harmful by day and ride the mechanical bull at night - it can be a "urban cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck, and wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. So, where does this leave Bud? As Sissy asserted her independence, she lied about riding the bull and flirting with the ex-con star and rodeo prisoner - a real bull bull, Wes (play beautiful fet by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy break. <br /> <br /> Sissy trap with Wes, abusing it. Hug her head further, Bud gets the boy toy in Pam, a rich girl whose father Daddy is in oil and all that implies. Sissy comes by the trailer to its own up - Pam does not kind of thing. He writes a letter to Bud, but bad Pam tears him and takes credit for Sissy's work. <br /> <br /> Bob's uncle died on the tragic job when exploding hit and cause an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance of reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later the mechanical cycling tournament is in the Gilley, and you know Bud that will be to win. Pam realized that Bud did not like him, but Sissy - he did it for her. Well try Rob Gillys, but you would not know the City Cowboy, Bud, save the day and wins the woman she likes. <br /> Of course, you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs." Perhaps that contributes to their bad marriage. Or why did not Bud stay with Pam - it was not that bad and had money. Or why had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had friends like stupid ones like Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to break them up: Marshall says Bud, "It's Sissy} rides that bull is better than you!" But part of the fun of urban cowboy will make fun of it a little - he says, is not Bonnie Raitt on the scene!
