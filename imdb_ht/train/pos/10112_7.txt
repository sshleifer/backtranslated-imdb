I originally kept this back in 1996 in a week she ran into a movie theater. I was under impressed by her and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> The infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. documentary covering his life and movies. There are interviews with people who worked with him or who knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some rare recreationals. It's interesting (a bit) but did really need this? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just awful. Wood was ambitious, but not a little talent to bring them out. I would not say he was the worst director ever, but he's down there. Do we really need a docu of a highly mediocre movie maker? I love the fact that they did not try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint. More than a few of those interviewed (especially Lugosi Jr.) pretty much hate the man and he comes in loud and clear. Also they totally ignored her film in the adult movie industry in the 1960s and 70s. Always read in interest if you are a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (tear Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a longtime girlfriend).
