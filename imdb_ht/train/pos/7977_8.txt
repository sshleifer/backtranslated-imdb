Basically, the movie might be one of the most fascinating titles made by one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's do it right, the movie deserves its hype as one of the most stylish actresses / comrades ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to tragic heroes Heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both of this movie and Deja Vu are best thrillers you can expect. Washington really got very comfortable in the unstable cameras and all the scenes executed in the movie. One would be easy to interact with his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings along the way. It is a success that created a super-dark Mexico city and a lot of what's happening. One should be easily convinced by the bounds of corruption in the fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think when they watch this ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's face it again. It's among the best of genre genre of genre, but he also suffered from a great deal of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify their actions in a vigilant way by making the film extremely realistic and leaving Denzel Washington playing "Missing Sheep" kind of tragic heroes. In the end, they even had the kidnapped shot of his own pool as a documentary. I have been checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for this ... So that for your consideration if you also find the movie theme is a little phony. , I hope one would not take this movie for real. <br /> 8/10 for artistic / editing / cinematography / Denzel Washington.
