The planning episodes were a bit dull, but when they came to the desert it was quite fun to watch. The reason why I call it the most realistic fact is because, much of my surprise, Charley dropped out of the race very early. When his hands hurt, I expect the usual stress and then a miracle range, but instead it actually leaves the race. The worst moment of the show's show was when Max was stuck out in the desert and almost no water or food! The finish was great and I was thrilled to see at least one of the team doing it. In general, not the same as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting look, as one gets a peek into the hardest race in the world.
