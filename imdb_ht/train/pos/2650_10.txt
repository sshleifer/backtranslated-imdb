In addition to the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) The rest ... This movie is actually better than the book (and the TV ministers though this is An easy feat, consider the director). The movie of unprecedented movies, the actor and (Kubrick's ever number one skill) the music - makes it the prince of horror. I watched the TV ministers a few years ago and loved the story and I hoped I was about this time when I got a hold of it. She wounds me away !!! It is far better than I've ever imagined it. It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of wallpapers that build up the suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watch it over 20 times just for the temperate atmosphere to spin the entire movie. Also the movie does not offer a lot of gurus (it's just enough and it's no means no tasting) a tendency that I hate in the latest movie horror movie. Just watch it!
