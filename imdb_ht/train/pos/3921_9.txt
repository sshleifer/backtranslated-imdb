In Carmen, Saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction, between the actual passions of the personality of a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the Carmen opera and the scripted passions from the history of Carmen's fictional, famous fatal mix of a free spirit (its inequality for loyalty) and its ability to drive fools and desires. Saura has used this same fiction / reality in a dark-and-white film earlier, Bodes of Sangre (Blood Wedding). But whereas the tensions between the dancer rehearsal wedding dancers have shown to their advantage how to evolve into the fictional characters of the story to be conducted in directing the emotions of their role in Carmen, the parallel between the petits, the libidinal promoted The dancers of the troop during the rehearsals and the spirit of wrought iron and the mythical Carmen never come even close to being credible. It remains a gadget and, for this reason, a bitter distraction. One really needs to see the next marriage and Carmen appreciate the comparison. However, he hardly matters, melodrama smile imposed on his carmen, because flamenco dancing and guitar music at the rehearsals that are 95% of the movie _by some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians, over repaying the price in the entrance. A flawed movie, and a wonder: perfect for doing a dret in Keats's negative abilities, maybe?
