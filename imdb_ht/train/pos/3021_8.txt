but it's worth looking for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainment was filmed during the war either required transplanting in American shores, as in this weapon for hire, or the use of American actors in the role that they did not fit. Bacall fits this part here. I was waiting for her to whistle and carrying Bogie in life; His tone of voice is simply all wrong for an English English class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not speak, except in the books, but Greene sent a message about an England that needs to wake up the dangers of the world. Another positive note: the entire group of Greene's characters was held in the whole. While Mr. Mukerjee looks like a Brahamin, at least his nationality has been caught, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
