I'm Stephen King's great fan of work, and this movie has made me even a bigger fan of kings. Pet Sematary is about family beliefs. They just moved into a new home, and they look happy. But there is a pet behind the houses. The New Belief Belief (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. It's the worst burial ground. Judy said Louis Believing that when you buried someone (or any kind of pet) went up to the burial ground, they would return to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they're wrong. Shortly after Jid explains everything about Pet Sematary, everything begins to go to hell. I do not explain yet because I do not want to give away some of the main parts of the movie. Acting that Pet Sematary was beautiful, but she needs a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, especially because it was so original and entertaining. This film features many of the make-up effects that make movie routes more strange, and scary. One of the most fundamental reasons why this film throws sharpening up my back, was in fact the make-up effects. There is a character in this movie that is really insoluble. That character is "Zelda." The particular character pops up in the movie about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Krede's sister who passed away years ago, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is not generally afraid because it does not speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time the living **** comes out of me. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great crises, some very good acting, first-drawn rates, and fascinating make-up. This is truly one of the most favorite movie horrors ever. 10 out of 10.
