A very enjoyable movie that features characters that do bad things and leaves emotions like anger and a desire to bubble revenge. Throwing is very good, there are many actions, and Stewart gets the girl with her revenge (with a twist) at the end. I've seen this film several times, and always look at it on AMC or cable. Very recommended ...
