I just saw the movie two days ago, and I was filled with anticipation, being that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent a very romantic 18 months there in the '80's. I was a bit ashamed that most of this group of vines, while original and artistic performances, did not take the "light" and beauty of the city very well. For the sake of the romance! We saw none of the tree-lined boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not just literally, but humiliating. Some of the plots manipulate the viewer it looks like, and let it down "flat" (the Marais sequence, the seller's hairstyle sequence, gives two examples). The relics, the charms: the section mimic, the cemetery, the Montmartre (though it leaves too much visitors to understand), the cowboy vignette, and the Sacre Coeur - seemed a little and far between, and I would have been Love has been seen as a wonderful actor such as Orlando Bloom be in something that would feature its originality.
