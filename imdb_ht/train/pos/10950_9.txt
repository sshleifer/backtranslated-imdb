When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I watch her, see how she turns around Sarah, as the character sees the world ... revolve around her. I got it, but did not laugh much. <br /> <br /> Click and show it, it's racist, rude, sensitive and hugely self-centered. I did not get it first and took it all to nominal value. Then I got to see her movie, Jesus is magic. I think that served as a Silverman Silverman for me, explains me just that 'language' she's talking. It's like Marilyn Manson, working hard to give us a face of awful ideas and images, but you eventually realize it's not an attack, it's a statement. But once you understand that, you find yourself happy to finally give it directly. <br /> I do not mean to suggest only smart people will understand, or hate this show is to prove your idiocite. While I love a lot of 'smart' shows, I still have this day not seeing the humor in curbing your enthusiasm. I get the impression that it's good, but I just do not get it. Many people will never find the Sarah Silverman Program, but I'm glad I'll eventually come around. The creators of this show work hard, every episode is loaded not only with dialogue and draw, but with songs, or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not put together something to fill a time spot and please advertise, they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I had predicted the future of this show, I would say it will go the way to arrest Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before it's time and live on at heart of fans' and on DVD. But take heart, SSP creator, your audience comes out, and we'll look for as long as you let you show up.
