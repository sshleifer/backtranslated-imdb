I'm honest. I got this movie so I could make it fun. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Dead"? What other reaction might I have? The thing is, though, the movie (and its musician) decided that it was not going to make the fun. Instead, he went on to try his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It has come quite close. A little less cheesy in the occasional music, a little more professionalism in the photography, acting, incidents (such as the proposals - love the best buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre, but it's still a nice little movie on its own. And acting, writing and rhythms are all amazing better than I would expect. There are even some decent humor, as well as two of our debate drivers how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can neglect the low budget (which leaves its finger fingerprint in everything, alas) and almost constant profanity, this can be a fun time fun in these films. No, it's not great. Yes, it could be best. But the musicians, the actors, the crew, they all tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic camp) and that counted for many. The line of zombie campy film is a thousand miles, and thank you, guys, do not add to it. The Kudos Quiroz brothers. I would like to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
