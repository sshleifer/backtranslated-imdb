It was 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes the GG character and his morphs into a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that keeps me guessing. The detailed work of safety precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was as well as intriguing. All the leads were pretty good but try as I might, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. Whereas Jodie Foster just makes you stop believing and really think it was Starling's FBI agent in the "Silence of the Lambs", you do not get the same feel with Longoria. But this is a fun movie, entertainment episodes with the Beltway as the series.
