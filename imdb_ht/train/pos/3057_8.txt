Wow I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as Alex's sad hit-man. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the draw is interesting and fun. / Alex, a striker-striker (like his father) and a little son, goes through a middle-aged crisis and wants to leave the family business to get to the psychiatrist for help and in that place he meets youth They will be free Sarah Sarah whom she falls in love. One day Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill someone he knows. I recommend you to watch if you like mature movies interesting. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
