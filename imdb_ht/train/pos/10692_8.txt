Good, funny, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies it's in). This was a good "car" for someone skilled in comedy and drama since there are elements in both. A romantic comedy wrapped around crime stories, great closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good, but popular folk comedy ("Truth on Cat & Dog"). Maybe they're too implausible. Ebert did not even post a review for that. The big "tornadoes" comedies are obviously totally implausible ("Bring up baby", etc.). If you've seen one comedible implosible, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to move from the 1930s. Strange. Birthday girl is a movie I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be the "killer app" for home video.
