After seeing a lot of Greek movies I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after watching this I felt surprised. These films are great without a great attempt. You can not claim that the scenario is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical. It is a real story and it happens in the rural Greek area in which you forget God. The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I really want that thing is not like this. It obviously talks about the xenophobia of the Greek people (the ignorance) of anything different. This guy's problem is not that he is an old convicted. The problem is that it is not one of these people. It is different and does not want to be (that's why it's all good to do her boomerang). And also talk about the apathy of the people, because some people are against the king's hunt, but they do not dare to say their opinions. At the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of society being religious and trying to act as God says, but at the same time acting so unjustly to the king. This shows how easy people streamline their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end you can have a positive lesson in this very bad story, meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even on your own, you lose (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and this would be a bell for everyone. No comment for the main actor because it is already giving a premium and I believe that playing it was great. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (playing the policeman), it's like a dinosaur, he plays a lot of roles and I'm sure that this role for him was very easy, but it plays it so great that you can not deny it a great craze. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
