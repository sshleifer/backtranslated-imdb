David Zucker has led one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with sawdust. Yes, it is a matter of acquiring taste and relying on a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is still funny at all unlike some recent comedy efforts. The movie is packed with all sorts of jokes ranging from the evident scrutiny of the more subtle type that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts including "Aircraft!", "Top Secret!", And "Naked Gun," the humor would jump out almost every second. There are many times that work, it's easy to overlook some people who fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitation of the parody genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have relied on making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (taking "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with interesting characters. It touches on overall film sports as well as satirizing sports industry instead of lampooning any specific cinemas. Even for those who do not care for "South Park," its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors and natural chemistry. The film also made very effective use of cameras in athletes, announced sports, and other celebrities, especially a bit hilarious with Robert Stack's "Mysterious Unsolved." By the way, stay in the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words maybe applied to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.
