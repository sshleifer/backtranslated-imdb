At times affected and in dramatic substandard times a well-depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 (Sandler's best role since "Love Punch-Drinking Love") that winds up re-unite with old nesting colonists her college adults and friends (Cheadle continues to make impressive work with all the roles on date), a well-to-do dentist who looks like it all? family, wealth, happiness ?? but really see an ally of freedom and self troubled his friends in his own private life. Writing with Binder (which co-stars as Sandler's best friend and acting accountant) and equal parts humor and genuine grim film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie-of- trailers of the week and own a solution to the affairs of the hands.
