Now this is what I would call a good horror. With octetal / supernatural abstracts, this beautiful low-budget French movie retains my attention from the very first stage. This proves you do not need fx fx or lot of throat to make an effective horror movie. The draw revolves around 4 comrades in a jail, and each of these characters (and their motives) becomes gradually more interesting, as the movie builds up the final tension. Most of the actions we see in Carrere's eyes, who just went into prison and were used to living with 3 other prisoners. <br /> I will not say so much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. There are a few flaws though: the FX are not that good, but are effectively used; The plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing towards the end, but Malefic is redeeming itself by the time it's over. <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
