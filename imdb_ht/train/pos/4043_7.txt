Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie in Japan. I've noticed a lot of humorous film jokes that liked Versus's first movie directors or his third Azumi movie. I've heard that they are without soaking films with swords and zombies with all kinds of gifts. Frankly I went to the video store to get the verses but I just fine and alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to start the end of the wall wall action then Alive is by selecting you. There are many actions however it comes as pay-off for a whole hour of drive built-up drive. I personally think it's good to do it. Of course some of the plot is as ridiculous as with many SCI-Female movie action and I think that the subtitles using the theme of foreign objects could be replaced with parasites for greater effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so tired of heart does not need to be applied. <br /> They keep the budget down to the most confiscated part of all the action of an underground building (taking a sign out of the cube) but the movie does not suffer for it. Another bonus for this film is Gothic intense fantasy that makes with great artistic flair during the many flashlights and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
