Although this film is somewhat sanitized (because it did at a time when people just did not talk about sex), it is a very helpful movie short to show prepubescent girls that they know what they expect during rules. Not surprisingly, she was paid for by the Kotex company, though what could surprise many is that Disney made this movie - as did a lot of educational films during the 1940's -60s. However, quite the movie is, though, I think the movie maker lacked a real opportunity. Instead of beautiful female voice maker and visually they are relatively good would have been GREAT if they would use Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang! I know this would give old Walt a heart attack, but wow would have a great movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is barely hinting at the movie, she does well to explain the general rule. However, it lacks some details (mostly on sets) that I suppose included in the booklet. <br /> Now, if only I can figure out why I've watched a cartoon about rules.
