****** AVAILABLE: BEHOLD THEM ************** <br /> So who are those "Men Mystery?" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of heroes sub-desperately trying to live out fantasy adolescents while botching both their real identity and their super identity. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaving his wife and children in the house while he crosses the street looking for crimes to attack with his extraordinary and unique battle style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver in Newlyweds by day and flings the tableware at villains crackpot at night, if his mother does not keep him occupied with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious is working in a junk yard to earn his pay, then taking out his frustration over his friends at night, being ill-designing one-material of friends and foe looks like threatening to get really angry (let everyone ask, so?). Ben Stiller respects the life of this character, you can not help but love her. These three lodges are trying to capture the moment of glory 'they have dreamed about ... becoming real super hero. Obviously, it might happen. City champion has amazing Captain, after all ... a fly, super-cop battle with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns into a stellar performance as a middle-aged affair trying to recall his fans in the sunset in his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back that 'extra magic' that might have been endorsed again, C.A. Free Casanova Frankenstein, a threat to over-the-top WAAAAAY played heated performance by Goeffrey Rush. This crazy genius has created a 'city psychiatry champion psychofrakulator' into a reflection of his own madness ... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of release from prison. This is the only human mystery sheet to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with these henchmen as the Disco Boys protect Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with the Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has only real talent in the team, with his mysterious bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful mind of her dead dad; The Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS turns invisible when ABSOLUTELY NAME are watching her; The River (Paul Reubens), awarded mythical powerful flatulence by a mad gypsy; and the underused underworld (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut weapons in half with his mind, then spending much of the rest of the film spouting riddles inhuman and over-wise acting. This movie really is a couple-genre movie. Anyone who wants pigeon-hole film in their own little category is fighting a losing battle. This is a parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton lying rearranged endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more parody material) in the ridiculous costumes, the comic-poker genre has become a great good-throw. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero movie, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea of ​​himself (for example, this film is in some ways reflected in D.C. The short-lived live inferior five works), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic book-book that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then launching at the inevitable wanta - and we all know, if the superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy and the S were flying around New York City, you would see a half-dozen news reports about idiotics in underwear getting the butcher kicks on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights very well, with the Blue Raja stuffing fork with great precision - all parts of the super-hero world. But what are the genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out patent the ridiculous nature of super-hero. One-material flying as the comic genius on stage threw out many bits to play off. Particularly wonderful is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo and his bowling / ball. But it's not a comedy in the sense of side-splitting rug or eternally memorable jokes. It blends in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really endeavors completely in any of it. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end, is that it's very engaging. Guys are weak / blame good to eventually justify and, for one shining moment, really become super-hero; justice will serve; and the movie ends with a stage that reeks in realism (as much realism as possible in a world where balls bowling fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the movie, then the movie can be a great stuffing. <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani from as bored and direction as Furious' interest, in spite of having an essential role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own line as the inventor Crazy Dr Heller, although opening scenes picking up retirement home in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villians never more than gun-toting lackeys (one point in which is made in the movie). The cinematography is chaotic and disjointed (as happens in the average comic book, so it is unkind), the music sometimes overpowers the landscape, and the special effects are never well integrated into the rest very well. But, in general, this movie is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of funny and genre of superhero really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun movie and a great way to kill a couple of hours and leave the rest of your brain. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
