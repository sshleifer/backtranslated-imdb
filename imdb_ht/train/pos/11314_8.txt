Wow! The sort of movie you might look ten times and always have fun in its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's first film, I'm hungry to think what would happen if she got any better from the movie movie. Only the other one in it I saw (at the time of writing) is Death of Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling visually than Ossessione (Obsession). One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but its history was not like that involved as Ossessione. If you click on "Various" in this page's page, there are still in the movie on these websites. They will not really do justice to the movie experience: such as graceful cameras, such as beautiful compositions, such as wonderful faces, such terrific characters, as a great story development, the first movie adapted from James M Cain "Postman There's always Rings twice. "I can not believe that this was done in 43, eight years before Brando was supposed to introduce realistic realism in the world and Streetcar wanted Desire (1951). The actors in this can not use technological methods, meaning they can not really feel everything themselves (I do not know anything about it) - but they're some of the best, genuine and realistic performances up to this date cinema. Also, eight years before Streetcar wanted Desire to bring a new sensuality on the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing from the beginning of the movie! Yes, I was superlative, but Ossessione was just that terrific. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> American audiences did not see its full glory until 59, eight years after Streetcar. <br /> I will not tell any more about it - just write it one of the best, the most beautiful and interesting movies I've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! Like another review, I'll buy it as soon as I can get it!
