This story is based on the Edgar Allen Poe piece ("The Fall of House of Usher", "Dance of Death" (poem) is actually quite crap from start to finish. It looks like some of the old black-and-white films on those who meet in an old decadent house (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", the "Old House Dark", "Night of Horror" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demonistic inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He died early in the movie (or she?) And the residents of the house suffered a number of dire experiences. I will not go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark home mysteries. <br /> <br /> Look at her with popcorn and soda in a dark room. /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
