This video launches! Eddie is one of the funniest comic I've ever seen. Not only does she have classes, she does some of the funniest observations about history and culture that I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and smarter comedy I've seen in a very long time. Tell all these other stand-ups to get to the scene and let this "executive" reign!
