Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close have played their roles and credibility, and I'm just crying. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed she wants to deal with the situation, but was under the dominance of her husband. "Let's think about what he did," Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said loudly. The story shows a rural family related to an accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy," meaning he was so uninhabited and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyze. Then at the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, left it all from a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his characters. Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs' role, did not add much to the movie. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Antagonist Ruth, frisoner, Andy, as a jerk that has not done anything to try to help the situation. Her Wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, has been acting like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around from frustration with her own problems without mercy and blame her for her problems. I could not feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did not cope with the problems effectively. They really did nothing for the movie and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as grandfather was, touching for being the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role would be elaborated. The players just did what they felt was adequate and adequate. However, I really like the ending very much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
