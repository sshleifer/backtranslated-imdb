This movie is good for TV. I love it because I'm a HUGE fan of disaster film though this is a family movie. The accuracy of the film in the book is half-and-half They got the right character names, but in the book there was no glider chaser, the car scene involving the Hatch family running from the tornado was not in book instead he participated in Dan Peeling with his friends and a police officer on the roads at the police station for safety. and in the book of Dan and his friends both 12 years old. That's all I can think of. Usually this was a good movie though it could have been a little more accurate in the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story in a series of tornado devastating a small Nebraska town in 1980?
