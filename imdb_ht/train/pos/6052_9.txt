Very recommended !! <br /> A well written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humor !!! Giving it a go, it's good to see a British Independent movie more than keeping his own against the big studio studios! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes of this movie that I'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to. You will laugh at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb version of Vietnam Jimmy Cliff and the London Tower on Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go on giving it a go ............ you will not be disappointed.
