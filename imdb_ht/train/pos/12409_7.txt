Prisons are not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties movies, and there is a good reason for that because it's not one of the best ... but as you dig through the classic films that the decade has to offer, This is certainly among the best in the least known / smaller films. The movie has some connections to blockbusters; for a start to an early directive for Renny Harlin; The director can be behind a number of action films including Dead Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Seas; and secondly we have an early role in Lord of the ring ring Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original, but the draw line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison governor. Of course, the spirit of the dead does not rest in peace; and when the execution of old chamber is fired, the spirit of the dead is condemned to save for revenge. The film is not exactly the Shawshank redemption, but it cares to build its various characters and while the main point in the film is still the horror, the jail drama behind it all makes for an exciting base. This is a good job too because other than the basic core, the movie does not really have a 'draw' away from and we only rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror of the film is at grotesque times but never on the head, which could actually be why why this film is rarely remembered, was released in a decade of excess. The mortars themselves prefer good and imaginative, however, and provide some highlights. As the movie goes on, we begin to dig more into the back-story of the ghost vengeful prisoner and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it do not make sense and it drags the movie down a little bit. Still, everything nails down to an exciting point and in general I must say that prison is a well worth the movie.
