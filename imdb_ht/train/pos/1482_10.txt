The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very exciting reflection given to the couples who will come to the world of dangerous and paradoxical fascinating in marriage and family. This decision could be the best or the worst of our lives and the lives of our children. The real intrusion or the help of 'friends' is the executioner if we leave. The real role of their families: they can help or they can destroy us. The mad priest who possibly is not angry enough to say what can happen according to the statistics and the reality. A couple who think of a 'special' wedding, live a painful story of their own future story. <br /> Who loves wedding deals? Nobody, after the priest tells their own story? if they leave the future in another hand, if they do not know what is the wedding. That problem is true, that life requires a real engagement, guaranteed, from each one. That the real victims of the divorce are children, and Andrea's real names in the movie- or names. That abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regret and unlucky will be after abortion. That state security and social security think every time less of a real problem in their families. The flu of 'friends', infidelity because of weakness and despair in Steffania because Tomasso lives as if he was alone. Maybe someone might think that this film is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the heart of their hearts, love a beautiful wedding and family, if not, why they love marriage? A really and beautiful wedding depends only on the couple: in each one of their decisions, in every single action in life. The family could be a place where everybody feels loved because of his or her, only not existing. Heaven is wonderful. Their performance is great: Steffania and Tomasso, Â¡almost cynically the priest! An excellent direction with script. Colors and the management of the superb cameras.
