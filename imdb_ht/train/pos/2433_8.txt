I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper friendly Ghost" cartoon. Complete it was an early since Casper did not look * right *, as the Porky Pig does not look * right * in the 1930's. But I digresse ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode of Dla Friendly Phantom's anxiety befriending a young todd fox whom he named Ferdie. I remember being pleased to see Casper have a friend, as those who watched their designs knew that most people ran away from him, screaming "A Ghost!" Casper and Ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows ... I hate leaving you with a semi-spoiler, but the drawing is only seven minutes long, so you can not really be too Limit. In addition, anyone who reads the IMDb synopsis of the cartoon can infer that what's next ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the infamous I've ever felt watching a cartoon. But that means only that he moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment about this particular drawing and not many others. Or, the fact that I actually remember this cartoon is all due to its emotional effect on me - I have not seen it since. But the cartoon ends on an optimistic note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. The second only in the cartoon Warner Bros. "Peace on Earth," this is the most I've ever moved by a short animated.
