I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I was hoping to be the kind of all American propaganda that we are here in Europe so much. I was guilty. This is not propaganda, in fact it is hardly political at all. <br /> It painted the events of 9/11 in the eyes of firefighters calling to the scene just after the crashed aircraft. It's an amazing monster that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was initially shot as a documnetary on a rookie NY firefighter becoming "a man". We can only thank the movie makers that they continue to work on during the terrible times they have faced. <br /> A great piece of work. Absolutely stunning material. Very recommended. <br /> <br /> Greetings,
