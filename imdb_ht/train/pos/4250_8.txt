Todd Rohal is an angry genius. Knuckleface Jones, his third, and most accomplished, short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will let some scratch their heads. What the movie is about at heart, and it would certainly agree with me about this, is how regular Joe finds confidence in getting into life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short time is to make judges on the race circuit, so keep your eyes shaved and catch it if you can - you'll be happy to have done. It is hilarious. And check out Todd's other movie also popping up here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
