Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a bit generous, but for that movie I think the directors did a great job and that they were available to them, this is also a movie movie of an acquired taste! <br /> I thought immediate was the direct connection to the classic 'movie things' movie that means the parasite aliens from space outta, infesting human army then reek havoc wherever possible! <br /> You can see how this movie pays homage to such a movie with others in the horror genre / gore, however cleverly maintaining its own originality, well things are fighting each other for one and then , continue to eat then fall rival! Only kill and pick someone when he needs a new army! Then choose another battle with another infected army! Then this film even throws a love story but I'm not saying that no more it gives too much of it. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said in an acquired taste, so do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It is low budget and yes it is thirsty, and the animals / aliens / things morphing the branches of guns looking for gross, ie saws, exercises, blades and even the odd weapon at all, but desperate to have opponents . I found myself cringing at what I was being shown, but at the same time glued to the screen asking what was going to happen next! <br /> So if you love gore, you love aliens, you love fights and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in a place, then I have to recommend this movie as a must see. I just wish I came across this earlier then I did!
