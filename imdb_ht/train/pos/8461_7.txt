Since the title is in English and IMDb this primary language listing as English, I must focus on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented in the Bandai release DVD series. My current review for the entire series is under the IMDb entry in "Shin Goa Wan Gundam W" (1995). <br /> <br /> Very little is changing in respect of plot, script and characterization of its adaptation in English and it really depends on your own taste to choose which languages ​​to watch this show in. Purists can stick to Japanese all they want, but for a more realistic "realistic" experience I recommend the English track since all the characters, except Heero Yuy , not Japanese (most of them are Caucasians in reality with a couple of non-Asian Japanese.) For one thing, the personality characters come across more "directly" than in the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is most thanks to some given -Pi-taking performance, but a very well-organized group of actors. <br /> <br /> Gundam's Wings Pilot Heero Yuy is a very trained soldier that suppresses his emotions, but slowly learn the value of his humanity.Three by Mark Hildreth that's You can criticize to deliver as "bad acting" but he Heero's humorous personality is very well. <br /> <br /> Death Of The Gundam's Duo Maxwell, Everlasting Happy In The Face Of Death To Give A Crash Of The Curishing Of The Value Of Life And Friends. It is perhaps the best character acting in the whole show, mastery played by Scott McNeil. It may sound a little too old for its age, but the English voice Duo easily out Hang Yrrrrrrrr to his Japanese Nazi. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lonely loser who is aimed so far so have to fight off; despite his inner desire to form connections with people around him, he only knows how to kill, not treated to friends. Kirby Morrow gives a sweet but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. Quatre Rebarba Winner is voiced by Brad Swaile who has no problem to pull out the nature caring of the character and the crush of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand. A bigger point is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes it is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version), but a typical 15 year old guy. <br /> <br /> Wufei Chang voice by Ted Cole may seem a little over-the-top, but he plays out in stark contrast to the most sophisticated roles in Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds great in English, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This might not sit well with her juvenile personality early in the series, but as her mature character later in the story, her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in beautifully with the character development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the best choices to change when compared to the Japanese version. Both voices carry out different places of the same character. Her Japanese voice is proud, authoritative and respectful, keeping in line with high ranking standards and charisma nature. His English voice by Brian Drummond is more to reduce, sound more devious and "like snakes", highlighting secrets of Zechs regarding his hidden agenda and independent belief in his ideal. bags mix really. Treasury Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye to provide a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to its larger-than-life Japanese style of talk. However, Lady Une does not transmit her split personality as unlike the Japanese version of Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... bored most of the time. The cannon manure pilots and military leaders have nothing to speak about either. <br /> I would appreciate if they took time to different different accent characters to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. The Maganac Corp's voice was generally inspired but it could have been more interesting if they were being awarded eastern middle east. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have sounded better with some European stylish excellent reflecting the statues of nobility. Despite the underwhelming acting of the side characters, the main cast managed to bring the show and it results in a generally less than-in-the-top and more realistic pronouncement of Gundam's script script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, keeps all the concepts concealed concepts and terms on politics, war, and human nature. Unfortunately, it also keeps the flaws in the original Japanese script.
