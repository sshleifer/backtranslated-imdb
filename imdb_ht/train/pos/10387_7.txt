Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something really awful, but it was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not good. I think some people remember it's more affectionate than it deserves, but apart from the car chassis and Daisy Duke's skripts, they were weak and wrong. The Duke boys were too clever and chic for bakwood hicks, the braked litter bar was too Christian to be wrong with Rosco was just ultra at all screen times. It's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of line story during the first set. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie in its own right, not as a direct comparison of however you remember the TV series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is in General Lee's course. Cars are chases and demonstrations are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is all about. Johnny Knoxville is self-sufficient himself and along with Seann William Scott as the couple's cousin make this film really funny in a Dumb-and-Dumber box in the way the TV set is never achieved. Lovely Jessica Simpson is a natasha as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a lot of improvements to Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a Rosco P. coltrane embarrassing belief, how it should always be. <br /> If you do not like slapstick humor and crazy stunts then you should not watch this movie anyway because you should know what to expect. Otherwise if you want an amusing movie-action movie with a few good laughs this is not too fiscal on the brain then go see this enjoyable diving with an open mind.
