The film begins with a bunch of children in school reform and focuses on a kid called 'Gabe', who has apparently worked hard to earn his freedom. Gabe and her sister moved to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meet with dead dying kids. The kids in this movie are small presses, but they are much less antisocial than they would have been in other previous films and come down deep, they are well-meaning punished. However, in the neighborhood, there are also some criminals who have lost their insurance coverage to fire and see Gabe as a scapegoat practice - after all, it would have reformed school and no one would believe it was innocent when it was framed. So, when Gabe is ready to be sent back to the "Big House", it's up to the rest of the gang to save him, and exposed the real Crooks. <br /> <br /> "Dead children die" appeared in several Warner Brothers movie in the late 1930s and the movies were generally very good (particularly ANGLES proudly). However, after boy contract had expired, they went to Studios Monograms and films, to put it charitable, being very weak and formulaic - and Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were pretty much the whole show with groups renamed "Bowery Boys". Because ANGELS WASHING FACES had excellent writing and production value AK Hall and Gorcey were not always hugged for the camera, it's a very good movie - and almost earned a score of 7 (it's real close). In fact, while this is not a big aesthetic film, it's sure a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Sure, it was a tuk hokey-particularly towards the end when children took the law into their own hands and Reagan ignored the Bill of Rights - but it was also quite fun. Dead kids are doing their best performances with Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan giving excellent support. Sure, this part of the film was logical and impossible but somehow it was always funny and rather good - so if you can stop disbelief, it works well.
