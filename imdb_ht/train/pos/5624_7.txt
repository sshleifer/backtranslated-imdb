I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. It was really amazing in this movie. The emotions he had to go to re-take shot after re-taking does not think about. This was a very difficult movie to watch, the subject is unpleasantly unpleasant and you feel so discouraged just to sit down and watch a woman being abused for what looks like an eternity. I actually felt that everything was deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and I did not find the conclusion of all possible. The director seemed very keen in using the height of his vaccine and love using mirror reflection, I believe he should pay more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece. I'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theater, this movie for me, although it was merit, just fell short.
