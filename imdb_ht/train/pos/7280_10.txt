in this view as a child. Although I'll probably find it's god-terrible now, it was kind of spooky stuff as I was only seven or so. I remember also working on a Saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching her, so I did not really pay much attention. However, the scene and the rolling boulders have been burning in my mind ever since. I asked many people if they saw this flick of films, but no avail. 12 years ago, someone mentioned that, perhaps, he saw her, but she thought she was just a dream; an awesome piffle like wind. It does not dream, my friend. No dreams right now. Again, I have never seen him since then, but I can not wait to get a copy of her stuff in my VCR. Anything that can remain embedded in my mind's eyes for 23 years deserves a '10'.
