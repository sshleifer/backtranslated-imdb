I used to watch this show as a kid, and I loved it! I watched him when he came to Toonami YEAR since ... Sheesh, I'm so old! I had to be 13 or 14 when he came on ... But anyway, he had a great graphics line, and I'm one of girlie girls-those who have watched (and worshiped) Sailormoon, and I enjoy it very much. The animation was not the best .... Well fun in some parts, actually, with the acting act was EXTREMELY lame in the beginning, but it was all a good look, and I found I suck in it's day after day. / <br /> Samurai Troop / Ronin Warrior is a classic, and one ever-two of my flaws. Ale Ryo !!!!
