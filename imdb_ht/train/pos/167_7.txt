"Dance, Crazy, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable car from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, bottles, and stripes of clothes flying out in a yacht and go swimming. This all ends when his father dies and leaves it with his brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job on a journal that uses the name Mary Smith; His brother goes to work for bootleggers. The top man is Jake Luva - described in Clark Gable as he plays another thief. Later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early '30s, MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that his brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie cozies up to Luva. <br /> Gable and Crawford made a great team. His facial expressions are slightly on the wild side, but that, along with his dancing, is one of the things that make the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert. <br /> It's always interesting to see the movies presuming, and "Dance, Crazy, Dance" is no exception.
