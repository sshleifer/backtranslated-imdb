. . . or tap on a computer keyboard, they would probably give this movie an eponymous rating of "10." After all, no elephant is shown being killed during the movie; It does not even implicitly suggest that any hurt. On the contrary, ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without a government permit (and tone suggests that these permits are not in the domain in probability). In addition, the elements conspire - in the form of a weird drought and a cholera human-epidemic - to leave the Wiley plant vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People (as their native dub) to close the story. If you happen to see now release the ground, you will detect the Elephant people less dough today.
