I saw this first film at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself I found the movie to be well-appealed. These children come from the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie in this high but with the right and junk dialogue they have made the movie a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more then others but I highly recommend sharing and watching this movie. It is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious facts. capturing high school sense, high school records topped my favorites list and hopefully there is a chance to be released in the theater. I really thank all the kids who have worked hard on doing this movie, helping me cry my eyes in laughing.
