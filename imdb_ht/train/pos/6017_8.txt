There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' in a rational way or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you would use for other movies. This is because it is not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have somehow turned into an object as Munde as a movie. What we see is not the unfolding of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see in film everyday, but only to imagine happening as the background we ourselves will give when we hear about some tragic events the news in or out of friends. We see it is our imagination in our abstract people - no one we know, but we were undoubtedly heard of them in a book or on television or somewhere. So what do you see? Events. We see people chatting, driving, and inevitably, escaping. Only the escape is from something furniture - it is the collective and cruel situation that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist even if laziness, or ... human nature. Entering the late 1960s Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the independent movements inflicted in modern existence. These animals are effectively negatively empty that can show any feature we can imagine if we want. Although the actions taken can be viewed as criminal or irresponsible, their characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings seeking a return to an unfamiliar, non-manufactured existence that is beyond the usual to experience everyday. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they achieve a kind of self update when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living. They only achieve real life in the natural world, though it is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is an eulogy of humankind attachment to the natural world. As even the most unprofessional piece of the earth succumbs to our notion of progress, we lose our souls on the way to death in the human spirit.
