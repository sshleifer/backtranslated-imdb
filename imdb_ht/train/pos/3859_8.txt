Paul Verhoeven's Two Fourth Man (Fourth) is one of the most compelling stairs I have ever seen. It really was a nice surprise. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as it is attractive in relation to Christine's beautiful hairdresser (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in the tight mind of Gerard might be more in the story. Verhoeven and Cinematographer Jan Bont created a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sexually abusive imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you do not want to look, but you can not turn yourself away. This is the best Verhoeven movie (probably the second only in Robocop). The True Four Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but my confidence, if you look for at least ten minutes you will be hooked. This is one of those movie films that you Need to know how it ends, a true whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. I even love the spider metaphor.
