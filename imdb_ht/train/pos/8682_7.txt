I'm sad to say that I agree with others about this Columbo episode. Death is a hand that is frankly kind of a boring Columbo with me. After a few times, I get bored and change the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their role but the story was weaker in this episode than the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland character. She hired her to investigate her beautiful teenage play by Patricia Crowley to see if she has an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails wife cheating plans to expose her plot to her husband's damaging career. Out of anger, Culp killed him by hitting him in the face and setting up the body elsewhere. I do not know. Perhaps I just did not care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him to the end. That's just the question of how.
