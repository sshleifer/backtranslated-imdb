I rated this ten just because I found it so impressive that one eighteen year old can do with a video camera. He has no season but it's very much engaged and I've never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go into the untold bad films that are pouring out en masse, then give this director the same amount of money and see what's happening. I know I'll be lining up in the local cinema for her first release. Modest good work, and well worth the money. What a script! It could be low budget but it struck the hell out of half the bigger pictures I've seen lately. Know how to tell a story, both in writing and in screen. Kudos seriously in it, can not wait to see more.
