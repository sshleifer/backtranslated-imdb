Marion Davies is great and underrated shows her stuff in this late 1928 comedy silent featuring the beautiful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crash Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedy until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lamps on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never make a talkie together) and the shots are invited from the love of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) is a hood. A must for any big movie movie or anyone interested in Marion Davies are still-maligned!
