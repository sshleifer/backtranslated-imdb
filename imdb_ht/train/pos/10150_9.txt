Sure, this movie is sweet and sweet and full of clicks, but it's fun, and that's what i watch movies for. They must be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with the short hair. Her smile is bright and her beauty can not be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love her. The two seemed to really love other eacb in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were amused to watch, even though the British Abo accent was creeping into Bronx's speech. To tell you the truth I did not really notice it until I read the comments, but I returned to the DVD and now its dialogue sounds more British than Americans with me, but it was ideal for its role with one exception . <br /> It's a story of two beautiful people who are married to other important people, but who find their soul companions in one another. It can be an easy story, but who say the films are all supposed to play like documentaries? It is no more unreal than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube. That's why we watch them and save them from the living humdrum every day for a while and enter the world of the characters on the screen. I thought that these actors did a great job in it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who tears easily. Do not get me wrong if, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie has many people. <br /> I give it 9/10 only because I save my 10/10 for that unseen super beautiful movie that I know will come along some days. If you see it published as coming on Channel Movies or Forever Movies, or whatever, make a note to watch it. I think you'll love it.
