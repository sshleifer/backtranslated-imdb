<br /> <br /> "Weak House" is the downside of the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this TV Mini Series. Later, the great Denholm Elliot was perfectly thrown as noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg were absolute perfection as Laded Dedlock's defeat. The film captures the essence of the epic and extremely faithful epoch of the book, Oli makes off minor conspiracy that does not effect the story. about all a brilliant film, moving with atmosphere.
