This is not my favorite WIP ("Female in prison"), but it is one of the most popular films in the sub-genre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who at this point has already produced a few WIPs. It is obvious that the film is trying to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a prison in USA, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace. Writer-director Demme really gets to work, always digging for new ways to introduce a familiar storyline. In fact, it is a little too ambitious for his own good. The film maker creates a few sequential surveys that borderline pretensions but it is fun to see how hard she tries to put this movie above the average-in-chime flick movie. But do not worry, demo always operates at the parameters of the sub-genre. There are plenty of naked and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a little slow, but it is very fun. Throw is a good thing. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a hood-binding wheelchair. Pam Grier is seriously missed, though.
