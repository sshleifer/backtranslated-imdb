Six degrees made me wired. I look forward to coming over and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replace their place of time. I thought he was just about to go up and would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised he ended up. We can relate to the characters who had real issues. We talked about every episode and had our favorite character. There was no one on the show I did not like and felt the act was superb. I still like to see programs being stuck in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest against this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give it a good place, do not keep moving it up that day and advertise it for people they will know it is over.
