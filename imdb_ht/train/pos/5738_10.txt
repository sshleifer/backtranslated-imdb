I just bought and saw the DVD in this movie. The DVD transfer is from last year, 2001. This movie 1988 is really a big movie. Most people overlook. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and loved it ever since. I love the opening shot in Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Make Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, the trip to Pitts on the garbage truck and Nicky is a very scenic, interesting one! Tom Hulce, as everyone else said, gave a remarkable, wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, with no expense, but a widescreen format. I recommend it to people who love the movie.
