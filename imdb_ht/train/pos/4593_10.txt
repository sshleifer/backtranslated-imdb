The fight is not as indisputably exceptional as the cascades, but the fight in this movie helped change and define Jackie Chan's use of props. Throughout the movie Chan uses odd objects to stop attackers and is constantly sending people affected by thick ice. The action feels real because the stuntmen are giving the movie all that they have to give and Jackie Chan's coordination is exceptional. The rest of the films of the movie are not flawless but will not disappoint any fanatic action. Chan does not just play a credible risk capture, but shows the powerful changes that his character goes through as he falls into despair.
