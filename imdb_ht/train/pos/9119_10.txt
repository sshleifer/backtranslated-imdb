Interesting ways for us to look at how often we behave sometimes blind to perfection that we sometimes destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue of how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as hostile and can not miss out on a great opportunity. The shotgun in comedy also makes it look at the film in an enjoyable experience. A must see for anyone interested in a more pleasant yet contemplative look at life. I'm looking forward to next product.Hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joanne
