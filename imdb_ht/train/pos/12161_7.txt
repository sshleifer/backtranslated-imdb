From the writer of "What Ever Arrives to Baby Jane?" and "Stop .. Cut, sweet Charlotte," this ke-end sugar in the sixties has some strange fun and farmers. Michele Macliamm√≥ir performs a bit of Victor Boono-type, but too often the film steals dangerously close to a bad music ... there is a terrible kid recital particularly on the half. Debbie taps, tangos and tricks up her Harlow, while Winters' religious fans have a lesbian corner. Agnes Moorehead checks off as a evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even have to pay a gigolo dancing with Debbie.
