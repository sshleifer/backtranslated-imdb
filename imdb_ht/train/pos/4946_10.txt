Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor, who searches for a character he chooses to play, before making a commitment. Freeman is a 'good fit' for this movie (as it was for "Driving Miss Daisy"), and it is not only credible, but it gets a chance to change her image by playing a character and dignity and privacy. Although there is no guarantee of life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyped. And it must be said that stereotypes have prevented, or completely ruined, a significant amount of career acting. This is a low-budget film that, amazingly, made in a time span of only two weeks. It is a well-directed and written film by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA for the movie environment, and the place helped to put the tone and timing of the movie. The editor is just in good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the 'subcontractor', to get Freeman to make this movie, while the actor was in-between film project. <br /> <There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialogue between each of the cast members, diverse and from different cultures. The film also promotes an understanding of people, not only speaking of languages ​​(English and Spanish), but from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, sex, norm, death, belief, popularity, principle, and value. The movie strives for some honesty, and reaches some truths, maintains the integrity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been out of work for the four years. In truth, Freeman is so-in demand as an actor that he is still working. The movie offers an adventure of bonds, caring, sharing, changing, and exchanging. And, the movie movie gives the viewer a preview of some of the things a actor must attend to prepare for a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are taking a 'mental health day', and go see this movie. If you can, take the other significant or your family with you. I ran the movie a 10 out of 10. It's enjoyable, interesting, informative, intense, and refreshing.
