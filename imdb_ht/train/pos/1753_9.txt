As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedy is very crowded. Simply being too raunchy is not enough yet. I've seen and heard many jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days. Coming to 40-year-old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I've seen the ads after all; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" What I did not expect to find is a heart and honest attempt in character development. There's always the strange "cut-wall" character that we see so much of Adam Adam Sandler's movie and there's always enough adequate language to blow the Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a refreshing love story and yes even a message. <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) someone I can relate to. In the first shot I saw that he even shared my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the film we get to see his own collection of antique. Andy also has many video games and a working knowledge of film and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most important of all; Andy is a good man, he does not swear, and respects women so much that they stay away from them. Combine all these factors and start thinking of it as a serial bandit. It's like my life story. <br /> <br /> The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personality, and they all work on a certain level, but not the Andy road. I felt it was sort of distracted in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the human characters truly human in the entire movie. <br /> I suppose since I mentioned one default I might as well carry other apparent one in light. The story is smart but too predictable and as far as romance goes; it is very simple. She deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen to the end. Ensuring its final deterioration is somewhat different than we can expect, but you know what will happen to the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small spots on the movie but there's so much happiness here that I can easily ignore it at some wrongdoing. <br /> <br /> When I say "good" I mean "bad" of course. This is a sex comedy and he wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeds. There are many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of a ship after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his daughter Trish in a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Ah and we must not forget soon to be classic chest sex section "Ooh! Como llama!" An interesting small note on this stage; The actor Steve Carell actually wore his stomach and the pain shown to be real. In the only courses made one take but it was always a very brave thing to do on his part. <br /> <br /> Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he has now raised my list of respected comedians who are sort of odd since I did not even know who it was before they saw this film. I was just impressed by his writing, acting and distribution that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future role. This man has his talent 40 of the Ancient Virgin proves. <br /> <br /> To be honest I was skeptical about this movie but early words were positive and I knew it was something I'd eventually see. I'm glad that I've done too much since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it's double as something you feel worth seeing. It's not just a series of sex gums lumped together instead of a series of sex gags being entwined with a very refreshing character and a really touching romance. Now excuse me while I go to kiss my bowel out; I can not believe I just wrote that ... <br /> <br /> My review from Frider Wave: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
