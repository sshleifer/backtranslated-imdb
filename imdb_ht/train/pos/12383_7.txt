Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York looking for a new apartment and begins to meet the strange neighbors and reveals a secret about the building and itself slowly builds up to the end of an end to the movie. This film has all sorts of neat elements from the Roman Catholic Church vs. The Devil, at the Gate of Hell, in rare rituals, in a growing plot, and finally in an army of talented actors and actress filmmakers. We found Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Debora Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, as the old priest. Many of these actors make it up - particularly Burgess Meredith to provide a humorous / demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable as is Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do as Jose Ferrer in an enormous role even if it is nothing more than a comedy. The Sentinel is a fine horror movie with lots of psychological elements and some really terrifying scenes. The end scene is abundant and yet refreshing. I find fault with some of the gender and violence in the movie, particularly the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Is this really necessary? I think not. Also, the father / child thing has been a bit as good as well, but overall the movie works and has a pace of gain. Director Michael Winner makes a worker work and is effective in creating tense and fear moments. Scene and Carradine are particularly effective.
