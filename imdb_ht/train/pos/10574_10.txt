This is a wonderful movie. The non-stop patent takes several surveys to fully appreciate. Music production at Busby Berkeley will never double. I think this movie easily outdoes all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's cinema. Put rational explanations about how to do it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.
