SOLDIER is not as bad as being made out to be. I found the film some of the humorous, cynical humor like that at the Paul Verhoven Troupers Starship. Lack of dialogue and top action is deliberate and add to the comic-book atmosphere. <br /> One particular trivia-bit stand out for me - Todd has the names of several space-war campaign campaigns on her chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the unknown ones out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the Roy Batty's elegance line last line of Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could fight with Android troops like Roy is the idea of ​​boggling at least at least. Perhaps scriptwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> I'll give this one 3 out of 5.
