What another review calls the lack of character development, I call exaggerated. The film did not hit one on the top with overexplanation or backstory needed. Yes, there were so many untold stories that we only received a glimpse into, but this was primarily a one-day snapshot of an event that catalyzed changes in their lifetime. Henry Thomas's performance was a truly beautiful study of the power of acting that focused on reaction rather than action. Good location.
