I am so happy that I got a chance to see this rare small gem in a movie. I've seen it in an independent movie festival, so do not expect it to come to your city anytime soon. During the film, I noticed about 10 people up and going out. Too bad for them (down here in the south, folks do not like having subtitles). The movie begins to slow down, but so rich in dialogue that I never felt bored. When the action finally happened, I found myself stuck on the screen as if I had mounted a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also had a great kick in the chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially those featuring the characters as they appear on the screen. He reminds me of Zelda (Ocarina in time) when you face employer levels. If this is the future of "video games / funny games" movies, then I welcome it.
