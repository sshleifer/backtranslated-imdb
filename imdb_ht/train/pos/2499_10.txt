This movie was amazing. It has an original concept (this movie a vampire meets Yakuza movie crowds). It's a comic and yet dramatic and yet dramatic movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and subtelly comments on society. On the part of Gackt Camui, the role of Sho was excellent, and HYDE was surprisingly good for her first movie as the tortured yet funny trailer, Kei. I also laughed and cried to the happy-go-lucky character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I liked every and every second of this film, especially moments like the cigarette scene scene, the fighting scenes, and most of all, the heartbreaking ending.
