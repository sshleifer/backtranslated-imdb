Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 pm P.M. One night I could not sleep until 3:00 AM <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> This short review can include the crowd. <br /> I'm a longtime fan of the Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I've seen. I do not say everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, watching over my own father, comatose at the ICU before it happened. The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a seller of identity being mistaken for this in a man named Kevin Finnerty. In those ten minutes I did not know, either Tony had dreamed, or I was watching some other shows. It was not like the usual Sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks like the sky in a "Helicopter Spotlight" and we see prodding in it, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we return to real life in a similar situation with the one I just stated. Tony was out of the coma for only a moment. His boy took A.J. House and Carmella, overcome by stress, break down into the hallway: a signature moment of the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we cut in between the real world: the family cope with the potential negative results of this coma, and Tony's other reality, which is parallel to what's happening both in himself and in the real world around him. Then comes the stellar point in the episode: after AJ Fini tells her mother she flanked the school and walked in to see Meadow sitting in Anthony's side. <br /> She approached Tony, and she won the best line of episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he went into a black hotel room and turned on a light. He took his shoes and went to the phone. She tries to call, but she can not - as if trying to say something back to Carmella, but she could not physically carry herself. Not yet. <br /> It sits and looks out the window. A shimmering light that has returned throughout the episode is now calling to him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When It's Cold I Want To Die" by Moby couples perfectly with the past images and help in creating an emotional coaster-coaster in an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. You know what the light is. It's wonderful.
