Guy Kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very, under rated actor, is superb in giving Kubae instruction; That is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the public to vote. A campaign based on no comment, "I'll take it under the advice," and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe no," is the way that is almost perfect to win an election. Successful, dumber candidate, the greatest chance he or she will have. After all, the public can identify with these people. With respect to the movie, she does for a lot of comedy.
