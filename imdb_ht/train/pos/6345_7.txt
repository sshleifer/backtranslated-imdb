The costumes and make-up were grand, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as a good job as can be done to write the script rather irritating. Make sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend that much money to make a movie you really must at least give enough story to the body to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I hope more of Ron Howard. It's worth seeing, but it misses the qualities necessary to become a major classic, not any measure.
