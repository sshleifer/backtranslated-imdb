Wow. See this last night and I still curled out how good it was. Each character felt so real (although most of them petty, selfish a ** hole) and the rare story of age-old widow begins to chagging her daughter's companion to feel completely convinced. The greatest performance all round but hatred goes to Anne Reid and our friends at Daniel Craig to the North (the last comes across as the next David Thewolf). And director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as it is possible to be. Thank you God. <br /> Watch this movie!
