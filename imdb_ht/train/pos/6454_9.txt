I saw this movie back in 2005 Film Festival Film Festival Palm Springs and in 14 films I saw there I would be ranked as my # 3 movie. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself and many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in a rural area in northern America's woods where many cities were much like the setting of this movie. It is good to see more films using rural scenery as the settings like SÃ¥ som i himmelen. This was a very good movie and I'm sure a movie is very tough to pull together and throwing its big cast but House Director Pollock really pulls this off after an absence of almost two directions of convergence. Helen Sjoholm in her first photo movement as a fantastic actress and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in this lead cast well rounded. I would highly recommend this movie and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
