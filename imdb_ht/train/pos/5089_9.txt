True, it does not follow the book very tight, but it's still a very fun take on the story. Swayze was far better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoids the "humorous woman from her depth in the desert" painted most of us probably hoping (see Kate Capshaw of "Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom"). <br /> At any speed, it's amazingly better than Richard Chamberlain's awful fear of Quatermain flicks. <br /> It's very reminiscent of a west in many ways. On the only thing I did not care for was all the mystic, but I guess that's a part and parcel of the genre. Like "how can you have an African adventure story without witch doctors and preternaturally wise wombs?" Heh.
