Back to 74 Eric Monte made classic T.V shows Good Times. JJ was always my favorite and I love watching the Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seems to be the star and not Esther Rolle. Jan Amos most of the time felt a bit jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity win millions of fans long to sit and watch Good Times. The show was dead if JJ would't have to save him and his still Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL Help was like his favorite thing about the show. I was 3 when he came out with 8 when he finished. Instead of 1974-1979 it should have gone as long as in the 1980s when I was just growing up.
