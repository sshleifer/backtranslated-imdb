Although it's not as creepy as it's classical predecessor class (ZOMBI 2) I actually love this one better. This is because of it faster pace, best setting, and cool 80's soundtrack. It is packed with action and it has sweet sweet effects by Lucio Fulci. Zombies are not quite as embarrassing as in ZOMBI 2 but they always look good. He did very well but he definitely had it in the cheesiness part; for example some zombie moves really slow down while others are as quick as ninja. Some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expect consistency when it comes to Italian horrors? There's even a flying zombie head! How to dress is that? Definitely one must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it would probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. Also check out Zombi 4.
