I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell movie did not make her beauty another character in the movie. Romans between Kate and her boyfriend are beautiful to look and play out pretty well. His relationship with his friends is both a thorn and a balm in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who was a MVP in many British films, did a great job at that. There are some tragedies in this but I think the movie is saved to the end by acting in brilliant, clean direction, and overwriting. The quality film is excellent and the music is good, too, though available on sound track.
