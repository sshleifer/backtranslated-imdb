I remember that I was a kid when I first saw this movie, it was my first movie movie (maybe that's why I can always remember some parts of it). I do not remember much about acting, nude scenes or other stuff but I remember a head boy blowing up with a grenade, a man breaking on a tree and a boy running down to the truck with the shot in the head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also note the latest scene when Jennifer McAllister riped into the bloodthirsty sale to get the keys to the truck. It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look. But where do I get it? How can I download it?
