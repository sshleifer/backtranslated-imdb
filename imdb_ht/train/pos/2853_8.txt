I finally saw this movie tonight renting it in Blockbuster (VHS). I must agree that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters have not been fully realized, but none of these movies. Instead, we are treated in the eyes of the director, his vision of what the story is about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want it. I believe Sabu has influenced the director of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I absolutely love the three road leads to seeing the beautiful woman on the street to distract them for a while. I really need to see other work of this director because this film really intrigues me. If you want insight, culture, storms and drang, go elsewhere. If you want a laugh, camera motion and criminal liability, see here.
