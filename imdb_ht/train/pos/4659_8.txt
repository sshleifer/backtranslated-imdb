San Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily be a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at its best, and for fans of Maggie, it is great to see him in his early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way for and distribution. For Englishmen in fifty soldiers (and I'm in bracket), it is always fun to see the glimpses and hear sounds of sixty rhythms, and although this film spends a lot of time at office, it has many Sixties Nostalgia Includes red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a tasty shot up the micro-skirt into a waitress, as in which England never seen from public places. As an I.T. Engineers, I know that hacking their computer tricks are ridiculous, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Neither are the wonderful stereotypes of Italian, French and German.
