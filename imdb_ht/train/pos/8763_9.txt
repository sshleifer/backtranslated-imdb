This film is cold, truly. Often we think "oh no, that will not happen to me." But he can. Contraband drugs are big money and often people are unknowingly (or mislead) in doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who love them, only wanted an exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that these kinds of events are not improbable or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society. <br /> I would recommend this film to mature viewers because of the necessary understanding to really appreciate this movie. It's very emotional and raw. Well worth seeing and certainly staying in your memory.
