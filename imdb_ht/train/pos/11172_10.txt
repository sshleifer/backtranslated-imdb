Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I read the first book and decided to see the movie). First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The act is also great and I love to throw off. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) adapts its role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also a few urine droplets in the (Idk if they are meant to be corny), but they really are lightening the mood and giving a good laugh. Maine's atmosphere is really a perfect movie movie spot and it kind of draws you throughout the movie. Not only will you like it but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fans!
