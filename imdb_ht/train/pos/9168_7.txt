This was a fabulous adaptation in Jane Eyre. The only problem I had and it was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought he was too old and made Jane very shy. In Jane's book seemed to be a stronger character. I was really annoyed by this painter in it. The party where she's in the morning after Rochester asked her to marry her, ran up to her, and hug she still made me laugh. I think they've made a bad choice in his casting. but Dalton was absolutely handsome as Rochester. he does this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. Another thing that made this version is not quite 100% was the quality of film. I know he did in the eighties for TV. if it was a feature film, and best quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
