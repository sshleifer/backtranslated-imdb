After watching the next Star Star reality TV series, I was happy to see the winners of the movie right away. I was leery in such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled. Billy Zane, of course, was the usual great head, but Corinne and Sean kept their own beside him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also in the competition) in the role of camels. The character Sean, not Billy, is the hunt, and its frustration to discover new rules in the game is well played. Corinne is walking tightrope well between his character Sean's only and only being in it for the money. I liked how the game played second right at last. Then beyond! Not a big movie, but a funny one all the way with a big showcase for two as the first time from the gate.
