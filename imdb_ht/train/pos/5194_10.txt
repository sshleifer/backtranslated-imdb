This is one of my favorite martial films in Hong Kong. It is one of Jan Woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he has ruled. You can see her influence at work under Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, choreography is conducted by Fong Hak On who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. She starring Wei Pei at "Five Venoms" fame and a whole host of familiar faces of fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers production. The story line is interesting, there are a few decent drawings twists and the build of the characters and the relationships with each other is cleverly done. This film has only had a VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a 3 DVD region and has versions of it on DVDs available in the USA. The movie is beautiful to look at either it's original language or in it's English dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
