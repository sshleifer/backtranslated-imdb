Marion Davies star in this remarkable "Show People" comedy released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who attends Hollywood and her father (Dell Henderson). The jaws come in is a hood - as is outrageous south costumes Davies. Davies lands a slapstick comedy work, not what she wants, but it brings her success. He meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who immediately hits with him. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and lands a work of stuffy period pieces. A beautiful but fake actor (Andrew Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical Hollywood star's pretentious. Davies abandons his slapstick friend and father for this good life, but of course learns that it's not that it really is. Marion Davies is wonderful at all, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required by a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual winning comedy self, and there cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the movie, King Vidor. This is a silent film and a few "sound effects" as sound pictures have just come to their own. A treasure in a movie.
