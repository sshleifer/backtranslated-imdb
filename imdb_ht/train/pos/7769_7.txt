Lauren Bacall was living in her husband's Humprey Bogarts disease and death when she made this film. Rock Hudson was close to the 1950's. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape, and has an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & dropped just for his role. The story is a little soap at another time but just as refreshing as most plays. Amazing how well drunks can be driven into this movie & also how quickly Stack sobers up to a couple of movie sequences earlier. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good & actually wise production this movie is very good. You can say that Bacall is distracted during this film while he is acting, it seems emotionally drained in some sequences. The sexual references to this movie are so mild, that many of today's young viewers do not realize what they are. The film does a good job of telling a story & actually leaving an end to be made to the end if any ever-made though Writing Beyond Wind would be a good title.
