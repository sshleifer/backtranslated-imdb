This series is featured on the United States Comedy Central TV Station. It was cut to death, and shown in sequence. This was sad for the audience it should have been attractive, it was not, and dropped by the way. Luckily, at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. Thanks goodness because I got to see "League of Gentlemen" in order to complete and uncut. The Twupp League of Gentlemen is just standing with "Monty Python in England's Flying Circus" and Canada's "Kids at the Hall". But warning. <br /> "League of Gentlemen" but is one step further. It's not just about dressing in dragging and lamooning the sick people, it goes deeper and many, much, darker. I can tell many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people, it will give yourself to others. But remember, its only comedy ..dark, black comedy. If not, do not look. If you think you know black comedy, look at this - if you get mad and angry, then you do not quite know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys have read right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation. There's a complete story saying here in episode one at the end. You can not watch this episode one at a time, Willy Nilly, that's one of the charms in this series. Look at it in order. Look how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed the guys. No one and nothing comes from limits. That, dear, is "black humor." Bravo!
