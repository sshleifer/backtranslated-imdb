It is not surprising that this movie won 4 prizes, it is a movie that is portrayed by any soul, it is not a wonder why it took Paul Reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his ideas. I can understand each part of it, this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear, or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam tinkerly gets a letter from his wife and leaves him get something else his son and he takes out on a road trip to get it, and while that they do get something lost, friendship, family, and affection for each other. At the beginning you know what will happen, but no if the story is not that easy to figure out from the beginning to end, it is a ride between a father and his son, and a husband and his wife . No wonder he took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actor: 10/10 Well you cant tell anything else that what I say about, hey it is with Peter Falk in it, it's a legend everything he does in the magic movies, when Do you use Peter Falk in a romance / comedy what do you think you find? A perfect result, not surprisingly, this movie is perfect and there are many prizes. As the son of Paul Reiser does an excellent job, although he is not a great actor still does not mean that this did not work actually Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the cast is a good enough stuff, but you do not see them as much so just say they do have to get this shiny even more. <br /> Music: 10/10 It does not always work when using music sometimes it just does not fit, but that's not the thing in this film, the music is perfect in tune, it makes the movie even more compelling . This part of the film will shine in as well as other parties, a great band for a sure Romance / Comedy. <br /> Overall: 10/10 There are many Romance / Comedy movies out on tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and non-, but this movie is one of those special. It does not happen every day that you can create a story like this, taking years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it takes to do it, a big piece that should be bought and caught in the human soul, see It's when you get old and see it with your dad in an old age, I think this movie is going to be induced as there is no other leg to do.
