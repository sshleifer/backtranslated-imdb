This was a very good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiled comment, but I did not want to take a chance. Anyway, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. I can not remember the first passage it read, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. It says it's Genesis 9:12, but it actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend the capital punishment. It's too bad that prosecutors do not spread the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard John Jay, the first justice of the Supreme Court in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is best in all books. Too bad we have lost in America.
