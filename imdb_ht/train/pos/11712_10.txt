This is like a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has been suffering for a long time without knowing what was wrong with him. For Patty Duke from the public eye and telling her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. I have great respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not find it on tapes, I tried looking for it, but with no success. Anyone know how to get it?
