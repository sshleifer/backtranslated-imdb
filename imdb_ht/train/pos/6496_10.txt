Examples of how a Second War Documentary 2 should be made, using first hand accounts from current and civilian troops who have participated in this terrible conflict, and archival footage looks around around the time .I keep this on a re-run on the History Channel over a year and a half ago, with no real knowledge of World War II at the time but it enveloped me, and now I consider myself a World War II war 2, watching and reading any and all I can find on it, but nothing comes near this landmark document, definitely worth buying the box set ............. < br /> <br /> This is simply documentary done in the very high standard.
