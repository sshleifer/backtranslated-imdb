Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and Binnie Barnes star in the "Divorce of Lady X," a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan who allows Oberon to lodge in his hotel room, when London's fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of Lord Mere (Richardson) announced that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with someone else at the same hotel, and she wanted to divorce her. Believe the woman to be Oberon, Olivier panic. Oberon, who is the only daughter and daughter of a judge, asserts that she is the lady in question, Lady Mere, when she is really Leslie Steele. <br /> We've seen this draw or variation there dozens of time. With this cast, it succulents. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, which great team at Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly beautiful and doing a great job with the comedy as she presents the uptight, nervous posting. Oberon has the role to handle the right light. She looks very young here, the brightest of the face, and Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She put some nice clothes on the street, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries over, and that hair-do, she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is succulent as the real Lady Lady. The color of this is a mess, and as others have been mentioned, it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
