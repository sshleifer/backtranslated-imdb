Henry Fool seized me. I did not expect it to entertain and entertain as well, or as strongly as it did. Grim Grim continues to surprise in giving a solid continuation of a story that does not seem like it. Once the viewer looked at the first 20 minutes of the movie, however, he became blindingly knowing that this is one of the best end of brilliant indie movie. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not the best. <br /> I'm a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I'm happy it's a part of this short run. It is convincing and delightful as Fulbright Agent. Also a pleasure is Liam Aiken's well-meaning show Ned Grim, son of Fay and Henry. This movie is a pleasure for many reasons. I'm happy, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the loser it looks (at the end of fools), and more to discover that it is, in fact, a genius ... well, that really is a wonderful stroke of pens la. <br /> I hope to make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. It should be right Ned to dig Grim and Liam should look for his father, validating the awesome change of his mother, and the near-genius sense he even feels inside inside. Suppose, of course, that Fay continues to hold many of the most important information from his son, regarding his father. It feels like it needs to be done. I would buy it. <br /> Even with more action, this is still not an action flick. It is more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, of kind. I'll watch it often. <br /> It rates an 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
