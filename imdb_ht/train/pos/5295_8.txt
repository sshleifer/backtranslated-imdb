I thought this was a good movie. The story seems to have a clear clear autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong does well in the lead, but the best performances are by her grandmother, Mink stole (a hilarious comedy) and, to all, Patty Hearst. I think the reviews are way to cut base on this one. They seem to take Pecker's worst assessment of his work as the gospel, when I think the movie is very clear that it is indeed a promising artist.
