I looked at Lion King more times than all my friends were wearing togther. Having a baby sister .. you know how it is. By now I have memorized both the scheme and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out I was like ok well let's see ... the second one was significantly weaker ... then I saw an ad for Lion King 1 and 1/2 ... I was like ok there we go again. After watching the 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitvness) were broken. A really nice and original scheme keeps you stuck in your place forever. I have noticed that the drawing was filled with many funny moments that ROFlmao is applying here 100%. <br /> I definitely recommend seeing the cartoon.
