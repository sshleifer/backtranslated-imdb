All a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a score. Scene and together they are very good, showing talent talent can be added to a somewhat uneven plot. The sinatra "I fall in love is too easy" is an indication of then and next best. Kelly's "Dance Hat Mexican" and a Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earns her nomination as the best actor. And there's a really funny bushel in line, such as: "Do you think the marine takes dopes?"; "Do you think anyone sings a sailor?"; and, "We got in a little trouble, we pick up a kid." A quite enjoyable movie, just the thing to shake the dirt into a recently concluded World War II.
