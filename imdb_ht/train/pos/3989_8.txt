"The mother" says a mid-60 mid-mother of two adult children (Reid) who, on the heels of her husband, found himself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has a affairs with a young carpenter who also loved his daughter's lover. The film is quietly passive, her stress relationships with her son grow up with daughter, need her silence to try to calm down in bed with her young lover, and the convolutions that come from. A slightly antiseptic drama and rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents, "Mother" makes an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable realities while avoiding sensationalism free. Playing better with more mature audiences, possibly women, who can better empathize with the central character, its needs and problems. (B +)
