My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1 which is pretty cool, creative and addicting. When the throw went into the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! Starting around Season 5, the show took a different focus - always good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of people (with one stranger) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological digging in Egypt. The episodes are light (innocuous and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the invented stories can easily be made into great sci-fi movies at their own. What's next is still unforeseen. <br /> <br /> The characters on the rests show are also well-defined and brilliantly done. Tones are severe, but the dialogue is blooming and comprehensible and humorous. They are simply fun to look. <br /> Starting a place around Season 5, the series began to evolve into a continuous storyline based on fighting a single limb (Goa'uld, then the Ori). The schemes become more complex (a lot more politically / strategically oriented) and interdependent. Characters have always been as ever but the show was different in nature. One thing to be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorate the 100th and 200th episodes. They just can not show. They show the creative genius and prettiest humorous genius that brought the series in 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes in the first 4 seasons, and you'll likely be hooked. If you like online history lines between two opposing places, you have 10 seasons of show look forward to.
