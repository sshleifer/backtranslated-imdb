As a resident near Buffalo, New York, this film gives me the point before I see it, since the story is based here. There are even a few parts with people who have real-world news in Buffalo .. and, for once, it does not hit the area. Aleluj! <br /> Theology-wise, puh-read !!! God always makes them look and think like people ... and, of course, there is a bit on the liberal side. To be lightweight comedy is, it's nothing that should have any premium but it's always fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> There are some comedy scenes laugh-out-loud, and, hopefully, audiences - from the Christians atheist .- Got something out of besides a few laughter, as this prayer would really be all about . Kudos writes for at least finding that theology is correct and gives a good message. <br /> Overall, it's a good-hearted movie that should be offensive.
