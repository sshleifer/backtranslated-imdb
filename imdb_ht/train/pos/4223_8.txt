The film has a great writing storytelling. It presents all the usual colonbo ingredients; Lt. Columbo's approach and the obligation to suspect it, the way the mystery fend for him, the Columbo dog, the cat and mouse play, which is great in this one and luckily as well as some good humor relief, especially involving characters a Columbo. It all writes despite the fact that it does not even have a really original concept. Columbo hunting down a detective / murder writer has done more than once before in a Columbo movie. It is also a very well-directed film from James Frawley, who later directed 5 more Kolumbo movies, in the '70 and 80's. He gave the movie with style and some really great and memorable sequences. It is one of the slowest moves that Columbo moves, despite having a long time running too long. This style and approach does not always work out well for a movie but in this film it does, which is perhaps not in the least thanks to their performance acting in the movie. <br /> <br /> Most Kolumbo movie either plays a well-known star or star star in the early days of film-making, as the film of its murderer. This star star is unknown to the 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She has not starred in a very awful movie theater throughout her career but still well known in some, especially for her role in the "Baby Rosemary", which also has an Oscar. It has a realistic style and a bit strange in acting, which some people might not like though. She earned 4 nominations nominations for Oscar during her career, before she had the "Baby Rosemary", in 1969. She has some great interactions as well as Peter Falk in sequence together. star an always young GD Spradlin. I say young because I only know him from his latest production from his career, despite the fact that he's already been 57 at the time of collecting production. He is still alive, but retired to act, since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even better than usual Kolumbo movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
