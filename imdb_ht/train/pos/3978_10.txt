I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Way Home" which is full of information about drug culture in America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows her stuff !! I found him to be an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I particularly liked watching movie clips in the hippie era, and the 70 stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Anyone who compiles it definitely was in touch with the tunes in each era. We hope they will pack and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960s and LSD experiences will forever change American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the film "Blow"), who was supposedly responsible for many of the Marijuana and Cocaine coming to this country from 60 to 80's.
