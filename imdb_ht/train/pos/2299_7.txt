Anyone who said that horror was not an educational film genre, huh? Thanks to this short Hammer Wonder movie, I now at least know NEVER to offer a strange visitor to any wine and a slice of bread and salt in my own home, because it might just be ipnotist and this combination will give it The power controls me thinking and thinking forever! Thank you Hammer! The tenth episode in the house of horror series is another I was looking forward to seeing, especially because the guy in chair director was Don Sharp; one of Britain's financiers, but still sadly confused. Sharp was responsible for many cool Hammer films such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: Monk in Mad", as well as some neglected independent productions such as "Black Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is unlikely to be one of the best in the series, with a complicated yet fascinating and revolutionary description of busy occupations. The center scheme about two antique dealers who stumbled upon an unusual object resembles a mirror, but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to call Choronzhon; Guardian of the devil in the abyss. The heavy glass is desired by a satanic cult since they need it for ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. When she chooses a petrified girl who runs out of the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult plot. Satanic culture and the karnal sacrifice of young women are subject to typical British subjects, but David Fischer's sculpture is never dull and offers plenty of drawn draws, among which a more inventive climate. There are also plenty of tension to admire, their dialogue has the understanding and performance they are superb (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is really strange). Recommended!
