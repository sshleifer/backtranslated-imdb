If you like to turn draw, this is your movie. It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next. There is nothing as it appears or finish as you think it will be. Characters are all frustrated and engaged. Cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper again shows where his disaster is pleasing. JT Walsh is perfect at his latest performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a first movie superbly in a queen. I categorized this movie as "I have a really, really, really bad day" movie. Not a slow minute in this movie. A real travelers. This film is muted and, unfortunately, neglected.
