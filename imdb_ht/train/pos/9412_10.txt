When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to do a scientist too. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a girl - friends together to see it a second time. I do not think it was as impressed as I was! This film was mildly serious again, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. This lesson from film can be applied to issues related to GM experimentation of today.
