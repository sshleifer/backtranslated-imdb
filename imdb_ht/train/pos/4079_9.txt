I saw this first movie when I was about 8 years old on television in the UK (where he called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved her, she was surfing when she was repeating shortly afterwards and I missed her. I was enchanted by the story and character, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been original English version of the armed version that I have seen - sometimes erroneous referred to as the "streamline dub" (the dub was actually not Ghibli themselves and only distribute to streamline) which is sadly available, except as part of a laser disks of ridiculous box-set. <br /> Unfortunately, I felt that the release had been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acts is OK but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dub or the original Japanese was, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They made some sense changes, such as renaming the main character of "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added some dialogue. But the worst of all I feel is that they have lost many scenes and intrusive music - the opening scenes of the airships for instance were originally silent, but spoiled by Disney's moratorium requirements that there are music playing anyone Do not talk, which I find annoying in many Disney films .. <br /> This movie still runs away from most recent animated films, and I can not recommend it pretty much. The plot is simple yet fascinating and the film shows a flair that is sadly lacking in most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.
