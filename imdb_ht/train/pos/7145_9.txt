This movie has a great deal of adult actors and a cast of youthful actors who will perform in movies for a long time if there is any justice. The director and correction was great. I can watch the book that this has been adapted from, it must have been great. (I like it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Tim Blake Nelson was an explosion to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis did not see enough, but they were fun when they were screens. Children in the camp could not be better. (as I said, I love it!)
