Lily Mars, a smalltown girl living in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway and its aspirations provide a rush when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily is trying everything she can get to Thornway's notice, but she just gets annoyed and excited. When Thornway goes back to New York to show her show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives him a small role in his next show, only as a family member, however Thornway begins to fall for this youth The girl and a romance flower, making the leading lady show, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets smoking and Jan-Lily's romance that causes friction and the show, she leaves, and John decided to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back in her role in the game, which can also prevent the romance. Very good movie, and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedy hand in her role (read in Lady MacBeth, while supposed to be funny, never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed the Heflin character (Thornway) more when she was annoyed with Lily rather than being romantic. The movie became a bit predictable and the scenes were not assembled well together, but a very enjoyable movie. Rating, 7.
