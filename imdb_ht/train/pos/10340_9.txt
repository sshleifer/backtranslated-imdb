Even if this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definitely one of my favorite comedy. It stars Redd Foxx as a father who attempts to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know anything about what he means to be gay and has all of these stereotypes notion of what gay men love. Her son, Norman, now grows and lives on its own. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines of the movie - when Ben gets Norman's apartment and runs into a woman whore and thinks it's her son to drag ("Norman ... Is that you?"). The movie was laughing from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although a lot of content is stereotyped, I did not find anything offensive on the way the material was handled, and it even had a good finish. Very recommended.
