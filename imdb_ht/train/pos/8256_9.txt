Watched this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and she thought it was very dangerous, stylish, and fun. <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and got up, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Weirdly, I find myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it. > <br /> Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie lie in a lot of political subtext - but did not cut you on the head with it. The world created was deep, and it made sense. There is a gay film Carnivora this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed healing discomfort. <br /> <br /> LOVE IT !!!
