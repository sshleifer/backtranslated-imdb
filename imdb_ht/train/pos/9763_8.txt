Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My dad took my sister and me, and the funny thing is - when we got home, Dad asks us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we want to look Raggedy Ann & Andy again! Lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theater to watch it again - at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was very scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene .. I do not remember a lot of this movie, of course, the beginning was magic, and a few scenes - I wish I could get it again, and They will likely seek it now. <br /> I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
