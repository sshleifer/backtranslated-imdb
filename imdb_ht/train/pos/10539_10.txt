This is a good movie, but it does not recommend if you do not like smart movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go, and that's exactly what they get. The act is great, the finish was not predictable, and it actually had a good story unlike most of those films. People complaining about the film being too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to cinema like toxic toxic (I actually like movie cinema) or the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. A note: If you notice this, there are exactly the same actors out of cube except four actors. Make it two notes: Wait after the credits (Believe me on this one). Enjoy the movie.
