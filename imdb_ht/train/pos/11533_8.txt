This film, which starts out with an interesting opening of two hot blonde getting it off in the back of a less-driven driver, moving cars, has quite the little bit personality. The cast of seven (although a girl does not hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the phone number of the death is already as low as) is all super-hot, like our story center around adolescents born out of the desert ( an odd, but effective environmental choice), who drove down to a creepy man in black gloves and jeans that drove a black truck. He predicts much of the machine-inspired slashers on the date ("Journey", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer machine itself becomes an evil antagonist. The assassin himself is quite creepy, and we find the courage of the very likable heroine of Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast to the evil assassin of all blacks, while our heroine sports sport all white attire, such as unpretentious and stonewashed as it may be). Director Crain makes some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast will try their best absolute. There's enough gore in the bar to please please the Gore fans, and enough T & A from a couple of girls to T & A fans. In general, this film is very underrated and hugely sought out from the slasher movie world as it's proving quite rare to get on video. Very recommended.
