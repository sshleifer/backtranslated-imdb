Here's the kind of love story that I enjoy watching. And especially, it's for two reasons. One, it focuses on young people, many young people. People who are still in their genes and have love for the first time, or at least their thoughts. All of us were there in our lives and the "Man of the Moon" is a magnificent reflection on our memory, perhaps adding a few more details and improving it beyond any of our experiences. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I believe that like adolescents, it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just for new to their love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or thus happen, they will believe it for the rest life. <br /> Throw in "Man of the Moon" is all great talent. It stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, who can easily play challenging district lawyers as well as strict but caring and wise ancestors as in this movie. Also there are Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the teenager, talented actress as it is at age fourteen and you think that over ten years down the road, she will win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull in great performance and dialogue in the compelling grim, are increasing in looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This kind of movie that I would like to see out more often. Love stories or not. I would like to see films that make everything look real and not fake or disbelievable in any way.
