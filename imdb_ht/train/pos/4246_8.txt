In this film, made only as the production code was being applied, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is wisecracking, man-chased the sidekick "Kitty". Girls from Missouri start out with the girls getting on a train, and Eadie makes a promise of earning money while looking for a millionaire, whole-few believer in the process. He did not take it long to meet with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the sweet doctor of Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy's "Andy Hardy" films.) But all is not like it looks like. Sensors must have the LOW Harlow line "A girl could not accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged." Later, someone says "You know we've never been alone" and Eadie replied "Yeah, and we're not going to be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, above Cricket comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige stated "You must scratch me to your list - I'm not a lady man" .... I wonder what line would have been just a career earlier earlier before the Hayes Code gets rolled into town la. What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to be great-tasting taste "baby talker" as stated in the credits on IMDb. It seems that it was only showbiz from 1931 - 1939, and "Munchkin" of the Oz Wizard was the last part played. Fun, clompton cleancut as the girls chase people across the country. See Nat Pendleton as the rescuer, who was an Olympic wrestler 1920 (medal winner medal) turned movie stars (he was in many of Dr. Kildares's, and he would appear in four of Harlow films.) Identity errors, twisting draw, a young Franchot Tone, love story, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit of "Palm Beach", although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a set.
