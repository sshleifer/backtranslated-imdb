I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway music and I love the movie. I watched the movie as it did not relate to the Broadway show. I'm an avid reader and saw what happened in most books when they turned to movies, so I developed a really early philosophy. Suppose that the movie will be based on the book (or music in that case) but that during the story line may seem it will not be the same, it will be different to look at it for what it is. > <br /> I dance for 12 years before I made a choice. I was a good dancer (picking up chorus in local production as a child etc.) but I was not super talented.I was however super talent as a rider show. I told my dance teacher and my coach (who I spent several months a year in his field out of state) that I made a choice when I turned 14. That I needed to move out to dance two-four days a day and ride 3 hours a day 7 days a week and dedicate to one or the other. So, my dear dancing and I love this movie and a lot of ballet and other dancing movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it is a great movie about raw emotions and human interactions. It is about the power of anticipation and anxiety when you work really hard to find something you want, and you just do not get it. I love the movie. I love the Broadway music.
