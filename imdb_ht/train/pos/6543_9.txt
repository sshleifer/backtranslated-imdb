I read all of Nancy Drew as a borrower and collect the books as a grow-up. I liked the effect used in the end (and a little at the start) of the movie where drawing lines in the style of the books are morphed in the movie scene. It was a neat way of showing connections between situations in the movie and books. For example, the scenes and Oriental antique dealers were very reminiscent of many scenarios I remember in the books. I thought Ned was perfectly cast, and Emma Roberts was a beautiful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
