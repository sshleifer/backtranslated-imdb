In this first episode of Friends, we are featured in the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and Eventually Rachel Green. <br /> We discover that Rachel, a wealthy girl who is Monica's friend from high school, left her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar, since she discovered that she did not like her. She decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, finding a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, for the other hand, discovering her wife is a lesbian and she lost to her partner, Susan. (We see him move to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, makes out (and eventually sleeps) with Paul the "divine guy", who gave him The excuse to be impotent since he divorced his wife. But in fact, he just deceived her. <br /> Ps: I just loooove Joey's haircuts and Chandler in this first season! =)
