I write this after seeing the perfect Son of the Gay and lesbian festival Mardi Gras Festival 2002 in Sydney, Australia. When their father dies, two German brothers meet in the funeral and after discovering that one of their brothers is dying in AIDS, they enter a warm heart of reconciliation. The two driving performs a magnificent task in creating the gradual heat and respect that builds up between them as the film progresses. I have one calm on the movie though - also, the brother who is dying of his illness, does not look at him. Someone in T4 cells would look quite sick - not even a make up work to make the actor look ill worked. A small grid, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. Although one little grab, the perfect child is a wonderful movie and you should be lucky to see it - do. I hope for a DVD release in the near future!
