This movie is finally out on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I saw this film many times and I found it even the current days (2003) when Italy suffered again from a sort of brain drugs (or the US for that matter). I am glad to have existence as the one played by Mastroianni in this movie who can sing from tunes; Perhaps they can teach Sophians Lorens in this world how to be strong and fights to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: as most people here already mentioned the act is wonderful but the audio background is amazing. I must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language but I can assure you that the show-off of machis, deformation of the fact that all-time radio-chronic at the Hitler visit to Rome can really make you shake! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
