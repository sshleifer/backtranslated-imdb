Our song is a beautiful example of passionate, film made in its aesthetic best. It is, in fact, a genuine wonder in a movie; a work penetrate with the life perspective of art life in three young interior cities (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the negligence of approaching adults will force each of them to make a tough, lifetime changing options that will likely re-define who each of them, as well as how they will continue to be related to each other in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay writing / direction is graceful and unpopular. There is no sentimentality, free sentimentality or clear-cut solution in this movie. What we see here seems, at times, to be real heartbreak. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in our song that surpasses this great other of this genre, including American Graphite and Cooley high. Much of the credit for the movie's spirit goes to its principle actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) are stunningly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, flagrantly obtuse - it rejects, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as indifferent or unlimited. In fact, their quiet charms, the instinct sense of dignity and rawness, intelligence sometimes interventions, throughout the film, are absolutely fixed. One should be completely "out of touch" and, or completely indifferent, the behavior of adolescents lacking the retonant authenticity of these three young ladies brings to the screen. Similarly, cast in support, particularly Marlene Forte as mother Lanisha, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie not to be missed - not anyone at any age.
