Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I'm a big fan and enjoying the majority of the movie, the finish was not fantastic, but the first 50 or so the minutes were - if you're a fan. <br /> I personally believe 50 in the first few minutes to re-look many times. Dance in each video is breathtaking, the fantastic music to listen to and the entertaining dialogue. It includes many of her finest videos from Bad and cut out in her earlier video. It also includes some live concert concerts. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson this is a must, if you're not a fan / do not like Michael Jackson, get out clearly. <br /> 9/10
