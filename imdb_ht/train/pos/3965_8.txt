The movie such as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Hardesty Chip, and well-made co-starred by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly hanging with script approval as well as all aspects of the movie, down in clothing, well looked and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover did not have something to be proud of. His management in the office from 1924 to his death criticized about the finest investigative services in the world. But by 1959 Hoover has already begun to worry about being forced out and already started collecting records on powerful people to ensure that and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to ensure that no motion picture showed even one magnifying glass on the desk. These films show only continued success and glide on the occurrences that occurred, and parts of the office of hunting witch in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the cheek.
