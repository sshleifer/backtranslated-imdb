I just can not agree with the comment above - there are plenty of interesting and amazing movie prints in this one, it has a strange structure and moves well toward a scary climax sequence that is remarkable for its effective use of silence . What's more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very Franky way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, but not staying with subtle sensationalism. He has the documentary suggestion as well as horror and art-cinema movies, and deserves somewhere amongst the cannon of different horrible films' as Blair's Witch Project and the original ring (both of which he predates and may well have an influence on influence). It's definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the edges of horror movies.
