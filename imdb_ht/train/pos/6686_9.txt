This film was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and in great appeal to those of us who are not really 'conformist' movie cast. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies with wide appeal, but when you move to watch a movie based on "everyone else is watching it" - you know you either an ant or not really having an opinion. This was a nice subtle humor - despite most people probably looking only at the obvious. The actors described the characters and aplones and I thought there was a lot more personality personality in this film. Is there an appeal for children, as well as adults. Esp. nice to get a good movie that is not filled with sexual favors and innuendos drugs! A big movie, not to be neglected based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.
