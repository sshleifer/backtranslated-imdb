I remember seeing this on television in the late 70s - and stayed with me! It's good, loud, colorful - a great kids movie. I put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought I was upset and expected something sick to reach the puppets a "meet the weaknesses" but no - it's own fun. Wild boar is in fine form, like Mama Cass, and somehow attracts the witchy skin. <br /> <br /> If you love bananas divides and you are in your 30s this will re-create that surreal mature Saturday morning I though I've realized now that Puf himself is a bit crap - as all it does is get captured and run! Types of TV movies - if, like me, you are in metal deaths - you'll love it!
