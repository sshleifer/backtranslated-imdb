Often impact tend to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failures at one point in his career when he established a reputation as a director. The reason is actually not the movie itself but the mood it takes towards attentiveness that it seems to support. In some places it actually be more of Wish Wish than the original Harry Movie Room. One might argue if this is the end of the day it is a movie about guilt, justice and punishment. For me, the end of the day is more sympathetic than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easy to overlook that sudden impact is a well-filmed movie. Forget "Go ahead punk, make my day scenes", that's iconic, but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco taken in the air, the zoom in the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or to look at the brilliant scene made where Sondra Locke's character visits his mentally-related siblings. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposed of figures. So all of the sudden effects is a very visual movie that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. But if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on the screen albeit in a movie action of ideally unreadable. Also, I think this is the first film produced by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been weak (see Misty Play for Me, Brreezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the movie and not distracting from the story . The only thing that is really annoying is the dog farting.
