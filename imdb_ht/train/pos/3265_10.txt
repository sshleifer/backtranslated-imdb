I've always been a big fan of Shepperd fans, ever since I've seen her series a few years ago! This movie certainly shows it to her best light yet again! The movie was so nice to throw and played !! Every now and then down little entertaining lines, just make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everyone really does make themselves! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie come true !! Also I loved the little where Mavis lost her perennials and it almost died when she fell to the floor !! This is the best movie it !!
