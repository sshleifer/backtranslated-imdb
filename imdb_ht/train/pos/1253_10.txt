This documentary is well-designed and carefully documented by the reckless case of the Chagos Islanders, who showed, between 1969 and 1971, were forced to capture en masse from countries through the complicity of the British and American governments. The British-American policy makers chose to act because of the perceptions that the island should be strategic base to control the Indian Ocean in the projection of aerial and naval powers. At a time when the Cold War when newly colonial colonial states moved away from the Western orbit, it seems British officials and Americans rather have felt that allowing the islands to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option. Instead they chose to be the effective ingredient ingredient of the native population. The film shows that no provision was made to the islands at the point of expulsion, and that from the dockside in Mauritius where they left, moving the Chagossian community to collapse in three decades of private, and in the new circumstances, Occupied by homesickness, they were subjected to a lot of accelerated speed of death. However, in recent months (and years), after many accelerated accreditation of Britain's public record offices (one but suspected that there were some mistakes, and those papers were not supposed to have ever been made public) which calls for legal appeals by the Chagossian community in exile to see British courts still get in favor of the islands and the British State. As such, the amazing conclusions and turmoil drawn from the movie can only reasonably be seen as proven. However, Britain and the United States have not made any commitment to returning to the islands in which the courts have finally concluded that they are legal persons. This is a very refreshing movie for anyone who sees, but it is an important one for Britons and Americans to watch. They must be silent in the face of such facts are to be accomplices of a very ugly crime.
