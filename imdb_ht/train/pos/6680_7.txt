This was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a bunch of actors nearly shared the spotlight, in this mass of superhero wannabees. The most eardere played by Paul Reubens in the "Pee Wee Herman" fame. <br /> There are lots of humor, garish colors and no lulls. It's a very funny, lightweight comedable and nothing but character jumps, everyone wants to be a superman, Batman, Spiderman hero, or not. They have talent in unusual areas, however, that the real heroes do not (and do not want to!). It's funny, but you know that goes. <br /> It is also a movie you can watch in installments and does not really miss any continuity. It's a long film for one such hustle, so take a break here and be okay. The tongue was tame so the children could enjoy this, too. In fact, I do not remember any swearing in here, except the guy in the theater next to me who kept saying, "What a dumb, f --- en movie." I thought it was fun for two hours but I would rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
