Here's a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or most likely do not even hear this. During the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a warm commodity, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he broke back on the big screen with three movies, all of them unfortunately bombarded. Two of these films I loved so much, and let me devise on one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wild Napalm" is a crazy fault on two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder has decided not to use his power again (for nothing is helpful anyway) after a fatal incident during his teens, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned home kill a man who was unbeknownest for them. Nowadays, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to Wida Vida (Debra Winger), who is under arrest for home, guess what, fire (see the movie to understand that better). Wilder also did not speak to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace put her hair on fire during his bachelor's party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his piano power and uses it for entertainment. He also runs a carnival and is the clown top. When the carnival came to Wilder's town, Wallace decided to meet with his brother and also saw Vida, who Wallace was in love with! Vida's house vaccine sees its end, but Wilder is preoccupied. So Wallace's stage and the fun begins. Brother vs brother ... Fire fighting with fire! <br /> <br /> There are some great fireball throwing in this movie flick ... feed your heart out, Drew Barrymore! The film also has some really weird, yet funny elements, such as Wilder's fire units singing acapella songs during firefights and after walks. Jim Varney (globally known as 'Ernest') pops in as Wallace's carnival. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliant shot ... and cleverly put together ... very on the wall and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Give this one a look ...
