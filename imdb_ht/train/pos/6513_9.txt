They must Honost With you I think everything was so good in this film should have no reason why it did not go into the theater, the Deaths of the Awesome Fx movie are awesome when used, There are moments Died when the story followed the little girl but all of this was a very good movie that I expected a day to get into the props it would be. The very first part of the film is probably why it came straight to video and kill a boy but then based on a girl and his mother who came to visit the mate's boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer, the property he bought to turn from where the witch ( Dan Fairy) life and anyone living in her home or going on her property will be in danger of not giving anything really far just a little info if you wanted to see this movie then doing it is worth the price of the rental
