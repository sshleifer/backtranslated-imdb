SPOILERS INTERNET IN ORDER FOR A SERVICE. <br /> <br /> Twenty years on 1984, this film will bring loads on the future of the Prince in the music industry. <br /> There is a stage that sums up the Prince's Musical Production in the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you've got the best of the songs in the last 10 albums and you'd have one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays like this. Prince ran to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club went into the dressing room to give Prince an ear on his fall from grace during the 90's and set out albums as only fans The most difficult ones can tolerate and support his artistry. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You're not packing them as you use them. Only those who dig your music are your head!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the music outline that makes Prince even more wrong when it smokes Apollonia into the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me thrill that was not the only female scene where mistreated in this movie. <br /> I'm all for the comedy comedy between Morris Day and Jerome Benton as they were stolen every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman into a waste can? That was nauseous! Other nasty emotions were the chalk characteristic of Prince's Prince on the thoughtful floor provided by the Minnieapolis Police, which caused the Prince to go even more hatred !! FANTASTIK !! <br /> Purple rain is a fun movie in general, as it is the band of singing songs that boost it to value by 110%. But then again the movie gives us another theory about Prince and his music, as the movie tells us that the greatest Prince's song in the movie was written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes Wife Beat Daddy Music! <br /> and filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince has stolen all his best songs from his father after finding his ancestral tale of song writing? Perhaps that's why Prince started running out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his ancestral ideas ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
