Agree. As you can see this is one of my favorite movies if not favorite. This is a character drama that is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business person who is stuck in a "same, different day" mentality. She sees a woman saddening out a window in a dance studio on her train every day and wonderful about her and she decides to get more information about her. He decided to join the dance class only to find out that he was not the instructor. From there it obligates and four other dancers and learn to enjoy dancing as well as find out about the mysterious woman. There is no free (or any) sex involving just a small group of people who learn how to build and develop friends. This movie was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The film never made it big in America because it was not qualified for the Oscars since broadcast on television in Japan (movies can not be released on TV or disqualified for Oscar nomination). He won many awards in Japan for Best Movie, Throw, Director, etc. for the Oscar Awards.
