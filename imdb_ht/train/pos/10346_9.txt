What was there about 1939 that helped produce many excellent Hollywood films? Well, whatever it was, they can also find magic in this Columbia picture. It's a long forgotten memory that Turner Classic Movies has started to show. (The Book of Maltin's movie does not include it.) In almost every department, amazing Mr. Williams is a jewelery. <br /> It's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry her. As the wedding bells on them in ring, she gets to call at the scene of a murder. The lady in the question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals, but to be part of the police force. There's a lot of laughter in the process. Melvyn Douglas proved again that he had some comrades in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of his career and is a pleasure. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. The movie goes on a bit too long, but who cares? The vicious comedies are still able to entertain, and this movie must be right in there and the best.
