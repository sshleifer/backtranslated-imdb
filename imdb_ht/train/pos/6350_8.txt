I waited and waited for this movie out, the trailers seemed to be over for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan watching movie over and over yet but I can not wait for this out for all to buy! Not a big fan of Jim, but this fits perfectly, there was plenty to see and the 'feel good factor' is on the perfect scale for Christmas. I think Ron did a fairy tale job in this movie, If you have not seen it then do this, if you win, look it again, I know you want!
