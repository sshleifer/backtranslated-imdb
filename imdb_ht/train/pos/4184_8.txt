Some war movies succeed where others do not, and can be judged in a variety of angles. The humanitarian community, where you can feel the raw emotions (fear of the assault, camaraderie among the soldiers, the tough job tries to face inside them in combat, etc.) are still movies I find compelling. Movies such as this boot and a midnight cloak are two examples of movies that you feel a connection to the characters in the movie. <br /> This movie succeeds on this level too. He speaks of "The Honorary Honor" and that honor will do the right thing. These 23 soldiers did what was right, honored and recognized in utterly incompatible with Western thinking, but it is, at the very end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
