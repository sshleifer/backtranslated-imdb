This film was a fairly entertaining comedy about the Murphy Law being applied to home ownership and construction. If a movie like this was done today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it has been inserted into the 'simple' quarantine, we find what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant of course perfectly combines the comedy and dramatic elements and works with a more competent throw support marks by Loy and Douglas. Shenanigans are doing for a fortnight of ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
