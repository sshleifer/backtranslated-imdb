In this little movie we have some great characters but a very deep scheme. It is actually nice to look for Singleton doing a great job in presenting the esoteric conflicts with the interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for. In fact, we have here all the possible clicks and stereotypes placed on seluloid at a rate higher than that of a soap. Definitely not a deep movie (though she wants them), but better than an average college movie.
