... and I love it. Many special effects, and for a movie that does not do on mega budgets, this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but this was still a great movie to watch. It's definitely up to standard excess bored in the rings, and on par with movies like Harry Potter. What says so much for a movie yet, made about a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> One thing I really like about this movie is that it is so stretching the envelope of adventure movie coming out of Hong Kong. This topic is exotic and original. Good quality production is unlike something that has been seen from HK for film action film, and acting is great. One of the best movies from Hong Kong, this is the hellish affair of Hong Kong fantasy films, and I hope they will continue to work in this area until they overtake Hollywood movie adventure. <br /> Just fantastic.
