As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for this out on DVD. I missed it when it was first over in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages in comment on the historic hierarchy. A better job could be to Hitler's "good" show. I also had a small problem with some of the choices being filed, not so much to act, but for their appearances. Peter Stormare does not look much like Rohm, why not do Babson as Hess puts a wig? With my biggest complaint .. many have always been in hit Hitler's blue eyes, why not do they do Carlyle wearing blue contact? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be 1st entertainment, 2nd story I do not think a lot of harm will do.
