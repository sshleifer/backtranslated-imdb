A good romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried to resume it three times and I can not. Sure says it's worth seeing. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. All of the movie is so beautiful and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic feel of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The act is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in the upper form and enjoy every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK, but fine. If you are a sucker for good, sweet sentimental movie (like me), catch this one. Also Downey looks great in her panties! <br /> <br /> Extra bonus - The title song sings by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
