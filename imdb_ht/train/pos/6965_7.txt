This movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is cord, holding, unfortunate, jealous, and power and abilities beyond those of deadly women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the movie, I can safely assure you it's not, but there's great fun to be on the road. Uma Thurman is perfect as the super-heroine of the mercurial, a Uber-Babe, mysteriously named G-girl, which unlike most of her sisters, is not * always * dedicated to Truth, Justice, and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as well as the Daft, yet somehow still looking, curator Jenny. When it was cast for a rival less than endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted, G-girls went to ballistic, and what followed was not nice. It's funny, but it's not nice .. <br /> It's a delightful site, hell is no anger like a super-contempt heroine, and people are involved not all together bring it there, but it has its moments , and I think I'll get the DVD. <br /> I love this movie ..
