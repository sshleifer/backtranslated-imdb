I'm Black Americans and I liked this soap opera. I watch it armed in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story of a black slave in love affair with a white commander led to his leadership and frankly, capricious way of life. <br /> <br /> A lot of you could learn a lot from XICA. He took what he had, nothing, he saw his possibilities. Many would argue that he sold himself out - but he was trying to ensure his future with that of the next kids. <br /> It was such an excellent soap opera, that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera was the best soap opera ever. We need it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. He is playing on Azteca America now, which is only available in Mexico or in the United States by paying cable. We need it again in Telemundo.
