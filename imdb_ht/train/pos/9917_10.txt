This is the most confrontative documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking look of a beautiful idea. Based on photos of industrial scenery concealed centered in the modern industrial growth of China, Edward Burtynsky brings in life confronting issues that we have so far chose to ignore. <br /> <br /> When taking no political party, this film is a neutral moving picture of reality that our western society chooses not to educate ourselves - not the products of economic growth, their externalities paid by citizens of smaller-developed communities, the source of our comfort and waste in our consumer lifestyles. /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. This is a tough journey but one is worth to take - please stop ignorant and at least see the pictures of truth without feeling any pressure to take a stand in these issues. 10/10 definitely!
