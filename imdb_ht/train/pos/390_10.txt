The first thing I thought when I saw the movie was: It's not really a movie, at least it's not our imagination naturally when we hear the word "movie". It is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you do not use expressing things in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you do not know with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy-tale ... and even one strange , chaotic. For me "Myth of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I love it. It tells us in the story's story about the battle between light and darkness, the battle that is old as humanity, and everyone who is in search of this sense of life confronted with it. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion with the vision of the world and the human is different. But as far as we all have and have the same human nature we have to have common experience and can understand each other. It's a really nice movie! And I that we had more films like this - films that have a meaning. There are too many empty stories that are good only to make time faster.
