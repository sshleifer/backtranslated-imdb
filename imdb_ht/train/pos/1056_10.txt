How can anyone say this is bad is beyond me. I liked this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The story intrigues me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please watch all the first quarter before you decide it's wrong because I know that if you watch the first season you'll love it and go out with Season 1 Purchase as well as Season 2 on DVD and then Join the campaign to get Season 3 made! <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure a lot of you "fan black fans" hate them too. They have something to show good canning! Are you not all agree?
