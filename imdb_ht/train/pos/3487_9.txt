Wrestlemania 14 does not often look at one of the great Wrestlemania, but I would personally put it in my top 5, if not the head 3. It has lots of great things, and it really signifies the birth of the Attitude Era, which WWE's Best Era was, in my opinion. HBK has a lion's heart, and puts on Austin as he did, on his way out, was much more on his part. She has one of the hottest people you'll ever see, and she has J.R and the King of the best ads! <br /> <br /> Matches <br /> <br /> 15 <br /> Battle Team King LOUD pop to return to the L.O.D. I'm not a fan of fighting the king, and this is another average. Very predictable, even when you see it, it's obvious that L.O.D would have. Look at Sunny for 8 or so minutes though, definitely help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavy Tournament <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> Taka gets a surprising burst, and his entry. Fast, high-fly, and very interesting. If these two had more time, they would surely have torn the roof off, and things. Taka wins with the Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, Chyna is threatening to kill. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reactions for outing. A really, really underrated match, which ranks among one of my favorites for Wrestlemania, actually. Two mixes together well, and Owen can go with anybody. Travel, and Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mix match Tag. Marc Mero & Sable vs. Lustr and Luna. Define pop for Sable, weird at this time, for women. Sable actually looks hot, and the crowd is just eating it up !. Constant sable songs, and they erupting almost every time it gets into the ring. Not bad for a matching mixing label, it was fun fun, it spends the time well. Sable's team wins, when Sable hit the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Tournament. Ken Shamrock vs. the Rock | C |. Before reviewing the match, I would like to remember the Rock has shown its immense potential, and its interview with Jennifer Flowers, before matching it. Nice pop for Shamrock, great heat for the Rock. Too disappointingly short, and I thought that the ending was a bit stupid, though Shamrock's antique antiquity was scared to see, and the crowd went black for it. Rock holds the title, when the Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Funk vs new bans. Prohibited are not as over, as they will be at this time. The crowd is actually a bit dead for this, but I thought it had some great hardcore bits, and some sick people. Cactus and Terry win the titles in the end. <br /> <br /> Undertaker a vs Kane. Big ovation time, for the Undertaker la. Better than having out of Wrestlemania 20, and for a great man vs. great match people, this was really good. It was a big all out, and the Undertaker took a sick man to hit, across the table. WWE was smart, does not make Kane strong, even in defeat. After 2 knives kick out, Taker finally put it away, with a 3rd one. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Championship WWF. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | By Steve Austin. Heat for Tyson. The crowd goes to sh * t for Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed Reactions, for HBK. This is really a special match up, one of the biggest wrestlemania events in history, you can say when J.R is even out of breath. HBK provided it all, to what was supposed to match his last, and Austin was rarely been the best. The animosity and electricity of the crowd is amazing, and it's as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with the stunner, and Tyson gets into 3:16 by knocking Michaels. Austin's celebrity victory is a wonder, and one of the crowds in the nose you will ever see, telling it right, and gone black. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania, and really kick started the Attitude Era. This is very special to me, because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I've ever seen, back to 98. "Era of Austin, started!" <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
