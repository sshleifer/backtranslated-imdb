I used to write comments in IMDb, but I do not do that again. It occurred that IMDb became massive, and consequently the subjects lost their score. What do I mean? That anyone who is not particularly fond of movies and does not have any expertise on the subject, looks at some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes, delivers a 10, and if he does not go for a 1. This, of course, can not be measured correctly. Now for the movie. I'm really sorry ever to deliver any 10s in some pretty films, because then I have to score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I do not expect to look ever again in my lifetime in any other movie. It is simply mesmerizing, and not just a way to say; it really is. The last 25 minutes have an energy load, visual content and wisdom-the words tell the guys to start, really ... there is no match possible. I do not keep movies, rarely I would get any sense of doing so, but this one is the kind of movie you should buy and keep, and look from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by. I have nothing more to say. This is a genuine, 10 goal for me.
