- Growing tired of the rats and living conditions living in New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) found a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find the life simple. But building a house proves to be anything but simple. As the headaches and bills begin to stack, so laugh them. Will Mr. Blanding ever find his dream home? <br /> - What makes this movie special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Any of the three can carry a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of me in this role. It is so good to play the set on husband. Loy is still a happy look. The Thin Man Films Made With William Powell are Near Perfect. And Douglas became a favorite of me over the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in the old black house, a particular favorite of mine. <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I get a kick from imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bedroom home to $ 15,000 revenue a year. Throw in the fact that your two children go to private school and you have a live-living girl to become almost fancy. <br /> - However, for anyone who buys or builds a home, many of the situations with Blanding's predicament find themselves in are easily relatable today. And that's where the comedy comes in. How many people do some of the stupid couple things to do in this movie only to finish more cost than expected? - The biggest complaint I have on Mr Blandings is all the "wife of love and best friend" subplot. It's really not necessary in the plot and feel out-of-place and very comfortable as presented.
