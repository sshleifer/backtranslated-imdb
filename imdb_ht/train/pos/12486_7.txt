Well, this movie is a really tough one. They must be straightforward with you, this film does not have much of a storytelling story, it does not make you want to know how it will end up ... but I'll tell you something now ... never have i was like tension and jumped up in front of my life! This movie sure delivers the jumps and emotions! To be fair, I looked at it almost midnight so I was kinda asleep anyway, so maybe explaining why I was jamo ... or maybe it's because this movie delivers in which aspect! It's basically about a couple who lost their children to a tragic event. They decide to move and rent a cabin looking things in the hills ... all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (I think it's the sister of the main character, and she brings together her husband) ... during the night, the husband hears noise ... check it out, and that when things start to go really really ... they do not stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something Not right ... to cut a short story ... eventually to find out what happened in this house over the past years and decide it needs to be taken care of. Not a Hollywood blockbuster, North does have a great budget, but please do not let that put you there. It's crap, tension and very pretty jumper! Just give it a try :)
