I like the film that does not give the typical "happy end," and that's my main reason for my simple movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and his best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) were arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after anonymously phoned phone to the Thai authorities. The film makes a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as (or which) of girls are involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their attorney. Jacqueline Kim turns into a terrific performance as her best-bride, A, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls were abusing more of the prison, as another commenter suggested, as I heard that Thai prisoners could be quite brutal. Where this movie drinks me, however, is its finish. Alice suggests herself in a phrase of 96 years in total for Darlene be forgiven, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any movie that challenged my expectations of finishing them wins extra points with me, and this well-acting drama is certainly worthy.
