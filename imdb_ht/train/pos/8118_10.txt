It was first seen in 1975 on some German TV channels and was wired immediately, after which I saw this movie around 12 times in movies and nowadays I have a video that I watch at least once a year - this film is Excellent in all aspects (directions, acting, cutting, music notes ...). The groups are exceptional and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war begins at late late looks like prophecies for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is good Mussolini and Raymond Massey are just good, credible and ideally cast as " hero ". The positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by today typically pessimistic standards - especially the ending scene that always carries a tear or two in my eye, even after watching the movie for many times. It's good on TV but it's done for the big screen, so if you have an opportunity to see it in some movies. please do, it's overwhelming.
