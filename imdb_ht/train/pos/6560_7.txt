I think that a great many viewers have missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films. This is not a bad movie - it is a smart language in a blow to the west. I do not think that this film has taken seriously for a while. <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is the fact that it is centered around 4 strong, beautiful women, two of them are black, one Asian, and a Mexican / Spanish character. These are not the usual western women - they're hard - they can draw fast and shoot right. so hard even the bartender shakes by pouring the whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that moves this story together is typical of the west - in the vein of "you shot my brothers - so I'm going to get you!" Only in this west, a woman's sister was shot and she was out for revenge on the gang who did it. So he goes and judges up old colleagues at his bank robbery days. One of them, Maria, is not really all interested in Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact of having gold and jewelry hidden in the city where they are headed. <br /> There are a couple of scenes that are not quite meaningful, not to interfere that many, they can ignore, but I wonder why they were there. So the movie can use a little tighter but over, this is a well-done movie that has failed to find a hearing that recognizes what it is. <br /> <br /> My only desire was that the only lesbian in the movie is a cruel - in the "heroines," one is obviously straightforward, others are not sexually orientated.
