Mom is one of those films that you know is good, maybe even big, but it is like eating vegetables or doing homework is at a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in. <br /> The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half hour, romance December-May, the idea of ​​a cheating man on his wife and then cheating on his girlfriend with his mother, collections of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters, the apparent indifference of the adults gives the children in their lives. This film was born in 2002 or 2003, but is a cast back to a British collection (usually made-for-TV) movies in the late 1980s - it has a moral gravity that never allowed up, which produces a vagabbing bitter. Mom is impeccable, but this is part of the problem; If a film related to many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies in script, there are some smaller actors - it takes the edge, but if such a movie is so perfect pitch, the watching experience it is raw and painful . The same type of technique - lighting, editing, etc. - makes the viewer look bad; London's in this film is bright and open, full of harsh, light cut. <br /> <br /> If you are hard as nails, or are one of those super-sensitive people who love torture themselves and gut-wrenching sad or romantic movies, then you will enjoy Mom. Anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared to break. And be warned: as difficult as the movie is from the start of the near-end, the worst is to come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do for her (because she died with her boyfriend), and the calm daughter says she thought about it and would like to hit it. The mother agrees to both stand up and - instead of a primitive slap - the daughter clenches her point and delivers on a blower boxer. Argh !!!
