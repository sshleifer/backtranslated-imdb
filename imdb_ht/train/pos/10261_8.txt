The first, this should not be a brilliant movie and thought to provoke as many other reviews seem to compare. The first review says something about the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror movies, apparently it's other way around. If someone looked behind the film he really did not mean to be convinced, he was a low budget mortgage. But really that all it was aiming for, it meant to block away viewers and strongest shocks (and all the flaws its visuals were much less apparent back in their original VHS version). I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright awkward (in the sense of no shock) it made me a little sick and well paranoid / pessimistic (i didn I do not trust anyone for a week because I did not want to wake nervously up and tortured)
