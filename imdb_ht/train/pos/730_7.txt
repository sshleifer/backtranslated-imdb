I liked this movie I remember had a very well-done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is lying in her smoking bed and then starts to visualize that the Ramones in the room and singing his song "I want you around" ... very cool stuff. <br /> It was fun, energetic, original and cool. Yes I'll admit that the finish is way-way over the head and far looking ... but it does not matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll Forever <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the group that was originally the star of this .. But I do not know if this is true or not
