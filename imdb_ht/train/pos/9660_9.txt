Only after some thoughts I decided I loved this movie. After reading comments from all the posters here, and thinking about it a few more, I decided that I loved it very much. I love American films - probably because they are so narrow. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. "Preserving rabbits," on the other hand, does not make any such attempts. I do not agree with other posters saying it's 'too artsy.' In any way, this movie means they are getting your memories of your senses. So often in all the movie you feel like you're having ... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, winter frost, the company, solitude, etc., etc. In any way, the director pulls you are in the lives of the characters - that is why many people feel so strongly that the movie is disappointed. After watching her, I felt the same. But on some reflections, I acknowledge that this is how the movie was due: the 'story' is not the narrative, it's the emotions you (the viewer's) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, landscape, and angle of your dive into the scenes - are rich, exquisite, and lively with details and nuances. Although I normally can not figure film without a completely developed draw (after all, not a movie is supposed to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
