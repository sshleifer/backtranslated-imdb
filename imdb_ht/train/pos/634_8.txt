I was one of about 200 people who were lucky enough to see a sneak in this movie. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows a young man on a quest to find a falling star and bring him back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a door between England and a magic kingdom known as Stormhold. This movie was just a joy to watch, she has something to read for everyone, all the action scenes played out very well and the comedy is spread out of the movie to make it funny without being corny. If I compared the likes of another movie he would probably have to be the Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful Danish Claire make her love to paint her at Yvaine stars in naive confidence and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivering a stellar performance on top of her as Larnia. but the performance of talking about is Robert De Niro ... In each scene he is down to steal the show ... <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a funny love story this fantasy is the movie. Guys do not get turned off by the description of comedy action enough and not to mention much of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained at all. The cinematography died on and caught up with the feeling of the film ... nothing about the movie looks compelled.
