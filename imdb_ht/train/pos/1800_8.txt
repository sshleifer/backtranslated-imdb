All dogs go to heaven is on a par with Watership Down for awesome kiddies movie. Both were dark and beautiful disasters, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age about five or six, I'll admit ... I had a break on a cartoon dog. All dogs tell the dark story of Charlie CAD Charlie and her partner in scratchy cream. The story begins with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering to the closest club to make some gambling. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this movie. I loved the songs and the animation but as I was older I started asking why I did not distract this movie as a youngster. It deals with beautiful old-fashioned gems - gambling, murder, hell and jail, but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something every child should look at once. <br /> Yes, there are some sort of crazy scenes of transvestite scenes and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, it delivered like a poignant message that should not be ignored by their parents!
