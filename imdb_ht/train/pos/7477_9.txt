This film consists of such great emotions especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to film and entertain. This movie was not the best at first I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes place in New York, and progresses in its form. He discovered a delimi- mate in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). It goes into a state of depression and then an outgoing mix of imagination. This movie was beyond my expectations, and is one of the best Cruise films ever!
