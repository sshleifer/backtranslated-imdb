Every day we can watch a large number of films, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A big movie, with real feelings, with great actors, and a great-to-be-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is the Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" and Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey to Hope". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, the love of others, the acceptance of other civilizations, the other ways of life. We also have to fight against racism and fascialism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; We only have love for our earthly companion. This wonderful movie, helps us to reach John (Lennon) his dream: Imagine everyone who lives in peace. These two films are hard to see: see these, but make sure you're going to hurt, but better. Great movie, great actors, terrible stories, pain and crying guarantees, but also better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
