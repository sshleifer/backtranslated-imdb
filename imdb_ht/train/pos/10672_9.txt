Anyone who saw this film and reviewed it wrong, I would refer to Roger Ebert's review of this movie. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and gave it 3 1/2 Stars. This is a great movie. It may not be perfect, or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. A chorus line is not so much a story, as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway Hope. I read reviews where people have said that too much time has been wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. This is a correct view. It is another story along with all the other stories being told about each of the Broadway hopefuls. Who fail to realize is that those dancers for Broadway show the same things that the common man goes through. And that I think is really point in the whole show. It is shown not only the talent of these special dancers, but they give us some intense thoughts about life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star is watching this movie with a strong emotional relationship because they go to exactly what their characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great music. It has its slow point, and at times gets a little bit confused with the rhythm of line lines, but all in all, I enjoy it. Take a closer look at the movie, and then maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about.
