How delicious my French was little to tell a story that is painfully sad, scary and life affirming. It ends with a brutal final that you knew happened, though you hoped - maybe even compelling - it would not. Indeed, this is the movie's greatest movie: it plays experimental and emotional with expectations, then drops a bomb on you. <br /> I saw this in a USC film theory back in the mid-90s. It's not easy to find, but it's definitely worth hunting for.
