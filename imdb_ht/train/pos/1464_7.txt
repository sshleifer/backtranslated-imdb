More like psychological analysis of movies, but psycho sounds better as a header. People in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) show movies here in his own way. Most of them are classic, but they are all listed here at IMDb and I would strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, conversations & movies and Lynch), because Slavoj Zizek is referring to them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, it might be spoiled for you. I do not remember if it spoiled more than I was listed (I think the Chaplin movies too), but as I wrote it would be best if you watch them all in advance! In the IMDB list there is a missing movie, which I did report, so it might stand up very soon. It's a movie Meg Ryan, but it's only a short bribes by big in a deal anyways. <br /> <br /> Zizek views and views are crazy and fun to listen, if you're open minded to see things in another perspective (though this will destroy your favorite movie a bit for you. It does not mean he will do that, but he could)!
