Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version. They're both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma looks more interesting, almost, though. And I loved the woman who played Harriet Smith in this film better, too ... it was more sweet and sentimental. There are some things I like best about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, though, as how the funny side is more apparent.
