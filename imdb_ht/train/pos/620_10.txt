The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think he would appeal to any maze, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet he's totally unique and stands up on his own. And I feel the movie adaptation of this story has a better finish than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil her for you. The main character, Tristan (Tristan in the novel), is a mortal son and a fairy-tale slave caught by a witch in the realm of fairy. The story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magic world from the human world. When a star falls Tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl she is infatuated with. It is unaware that the star took the form of a girl in the world of fairy and others after her too. Three elder witches who want to use his heart become young again, and some brute heads. <br /> It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal and visual scenes. It's good and I feel it can look like children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true story of classic history, the love I have not seen in movies since the 1980s.
