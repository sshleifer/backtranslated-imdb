I've always enjoyed the film describing life as it is. Life sometimes has boring plates, no real plots, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Run Through It" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Norman Maclean). Life ebbs and shed like a river, and it has its rough spot, but it is a wonderful trip. Robert Redford brings much of the movie. Repairing it has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, she is retenue and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the act, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well to my brothers. I do not know well how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performance, except that they really feel real. "A river running through it" is a wonderful movie. <br /> 8.6 out of 10
