I was a fan of Star Trek for as long as I can remember. When the planning and premiere of the fifth series were announced, I was very excited. Premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect environment and a great task to perform all the characters. NX-01, the Enterprise is the perfect container to show off the start of what many have become like. Scott Bakula was just as superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a Commander Performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That's just two people in this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us to the great story of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> Enterprise seems to be a good well worth looking look, and I recommend that. Look-l.
