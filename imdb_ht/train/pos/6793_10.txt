I absolutely love this game of death. Ever since I was 9 years old (I now 15). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget the dragon form is finally awesome! I'm still waiting a remake, prequel, or an end to this spectacular video game. <br /> You play as arrows, a young sword that has the potential to be quite the hero. On this adventure you meet all cute creatures and boss fights. You also encounter some friends along the way with their own special elements. Like fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, Earth, light, and wind. There are also known items as dragon demons, allowing you to transform into all legendary creatures of legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called wingles and evil creatures you will have to face on this adventure of action-packed emotions and excitement. One of my favorite game ever, the Dragon Legend!
