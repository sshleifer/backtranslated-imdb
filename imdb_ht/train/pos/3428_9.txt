I saw this movie tonight in NYC at Sunshine Landmark. I did not know what to expect, I did not read it much about it as I knew I would see it does not matter. All in all, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "Anti-war" statements, which makes me, leaving the politics out of it. Soldiers mainly talked about the awareness of the toxicity of the boots camp training, and how difficult it was once to return to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia say about the difficulty of surviving not only the war, but denying the order to go back when he was against personal morals. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says he is not seen it or he does not live with the marks of war on the soul.
