I saw this film more than once. It was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in TV movies back then. The only problem I had with the title for obvious reasons ... A immediately thinking of the famous snack cake by the Drake! Leaving the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would have been enough. Richard Crenna still manages to bring a sense of gravity to nothing, anyway - if the plot is good or bad. But this was an enjoyable Halloween ticket offered by the CBS network. I liked the party where Crenna took a flight in some dark countries to find the mystic that would help him to conquer the evil creature. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Large dialogue between the native cabinet driver and Crenna in terms of cabby's disappearances of his own ethnic beliefs. 'Oh, Mr. Barry, I left that thing behind when I came down from the mountains ...' - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or mentors people, and nobody knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> As far as supernatural fare goes, this movie is still enjoyable.
