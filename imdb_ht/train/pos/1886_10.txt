I loved this movie ever since its first in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw it! She never fails to make me laugh or encourage me if I feel down. The three drives are fantastic and the script is priceless, plus how do you not get nostalgic listening to the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know all the script, so when someone watch it for the first time I have to hold back and say something about how funny the next line it is. I can not even narrow it down, although, Sir John's characters probably become the most memorable ones. The famous "I will alert the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The scene of Arthur's soon to be daughter's father's house is a cry, particularly his interaction with the Moose. Make yourself a favor and see this movie!
