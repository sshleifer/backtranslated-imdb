I saw this movie kung fu when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friends have read about DVD !!! <br /> We got a mixed mix, and watch this classic! He lost NO in it's original Kung fu coolness! If you're a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... the DVD is available. I believe that this film is also called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> Look at it soon!
