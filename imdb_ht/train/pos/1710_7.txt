This film is an exact copy of a television series on American television channel doordarshan which was revealed at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" meaning balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is the sweetest and "convincing" Abhay Goal doing a good job but does not fit the role of a normal "normal" and "third-grade" guy (as she calls herself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi and his hair short cut and without the designer clothes would have equip the role of Abhays but Shayan just does not have the talent to pull him off. <br /> I would suggest watching the series if it is available. It is the same story except for running around with friends and the initial introduction. Acting in the TV actors was better than those "stars". The only reason these films are is flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour (or 45 minutes) the story 2+ hours. So he found trains. Even the sings of song sensation nose could not make up. This cinema is good for a lazy afternoon afternoon and it is really worthwhile if you did not watch the original TV serial. The script and the end of the series were better <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### # SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### MUST End In The Original Series was stronger than the hero herself storing the same girl thought she wanted to marry her. He knows and says he does not want to "return" and he never helps with that intention. The director or the script writes somehow could not take the original finish of this movie. The original finish was bought tears of the girl's eyes and would have been nodding nodding in agreement. The salvation just was not right. <br /> But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director / scriptwriter. The story is amazing and is not one of the most famous novel writers in the munshi premchand. I'm not sure if this is the first munshi story, but many of the other short stories, series series a few of the first munshi and other great writer history writers.
