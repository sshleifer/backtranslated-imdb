When you see this movie, you should take warning that it's not a normal movie. It has no real history just character, a bunch of gangster characters that come together in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie back and listen. The movie means that it is difficult to find a good way to describe it. <br /> That's why user comments on this movie are so mixed. <br /> <br /> I for one likes the movie and recommends it to everyone who likes one-material and things that are different from the "normal". You can not really put the finger on what is so wonderful about it it's just a funny world where gangsters rule. Somewhere in love and dangers. A movie that you can see more than once.
