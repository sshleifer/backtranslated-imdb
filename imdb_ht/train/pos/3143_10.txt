If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. It allows us to escape back in time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laughter, this show keeps you laughing in the three decades of gap. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and even the drugs were tolerated. The pen hair, the music was accompanied by roller-skate, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be." Take a trip back to greatest times in the American history. Fall in love with characters and feel good in the small town where people were nicer to each other. This classic is on TV as much as "Full House". Do not miss it, and always remember to "shake your stuff ..."
