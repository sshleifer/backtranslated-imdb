I've seen several comments here about Brando using a South accent, some of which felt it was a mistake. When this film, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. Jim Crow's laws have always been in effect. Civil Rights was in its infancy. Could this be perhaps a subtle social expression, a South person in love with a woman in another race? The same way MASH was a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment made on Myoshi Umeki appeared "cold". Anyone who was in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotions in front of foreigners. There were strict social rules, especially for men to meet single women. Americans in Japan were totally alien to this culture, and their attempts to meet women were shocking women. A feature of the Japanese smiled when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many American military took as a sign that their advances were welcomed. Also remember that at the time represented in the film, Japan has just been beaten, and the occupation forces have been treated and reluctant to hesitate. I think Myoshi Umeki has given a very credible performance of what his situation would have been. Watching his interaction with American actors brought back several memories of my own experience in the country. I was able to meet a nice pair of young ladies who, after convincing them I did not typically Indian men, taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country.
