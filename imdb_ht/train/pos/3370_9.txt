Having just chronic in the heroic minute just minutes ago I found myself very pleased, but questions still looming on me. While it would appear that the first 7 episodes or these are actually a storytelling of the first events in the Lodoss War Truth is that they really are not. It would seem that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of the original as it ended (and the reason for the first 7 episodes could happen) but I did not find that to be the case. CotHK said it started 5 years after the Heros War that Parn was part of. I think the director did the first 5 episodes to look like a reminder of the original just giving the viewer a small booster and an introduction to characters and their works because they appeared much less after the series kicks in Spark's story. Now, once the series makes Kick of Spark's portion we find ourselves kicking up another 10 years (15 years now since the War of Heros). Spark and crew, in some cases, looks like Parn and his crew once the tour kicks off of gears, especially the love story that's mixed between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I threw into the original set and if it was not for the long blue spark I know I would have pressed to stop more than once to ensure that the right disc was in. There is no I mean to consider these major series however, the writers did a fine job of creatively credible characters and a remarkable storyline. The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ??? Do not get me wrong both are great villains even though the Ashram is just astonishingly very is that it supports the Marmo. Perhaps I missed something during the career of the series explaining that part. As far as suites go though, I highly recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, even more so, the original record of War Lodoss far above the Lord of the ring trilogy. Both of these are more seasonally than anything I have ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.
