This film is on one side of Ireland that Americans do not normally see, narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world'. The film, by admission to the old enough Fethard residents to remember their events, is fairly accurate (even though they insist that film-makers invent some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action). The film was very popular in Ireland as it describes the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * have * organized the minor veto (before Protesting it was Jews). The movie is a fascinating insight into all religions in Ireland
