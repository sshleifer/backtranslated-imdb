This movie is wonderful. Writing this, directing, acting all is fantastic. Very witty and smart script. Performing performance by actor, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully original. Really original and heart-choingly unpredictable. The scenes are alive with cool energy and really talented output.
