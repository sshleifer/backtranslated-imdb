My observation: Outstanding vamping outfit is ravishing and beautiful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette put it well, and it happened even with naive naive. Boat collision in the balcony served him right. Suit team in his girlfriend mafia was born surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 designer costumes made great work. Song theme is just wonderful. <br /> <br /> Warning Negative Negative: 1942 was the time of WW II; Pearl Harbor spent years before. US Just Out of Great Depression; Need to get out and spend this hard earn money on rehabilitation of songs, dance and yes, fantastic fantasy. Despicable dictators were trying out the rules outside RL, blowing out freedom. Thanks to the public goodness these cinemas have featured fantastic fantastic lines. The film will have been a privileged treat, in the time of depressing. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have to talk and criticize. Jeanette and Nelson's movies stand the test in time. <br /> <br /> Angel angel wonderful, the real angel. RL wing in party costume is not so hot, but great about Jeanette considering the SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful song by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette Dancing was a better fun. <br /> 15/10
