Greet again from the darkness. Stunning photography emphasizes this Disney documentary and gives a glimpse of some of the sect of animals that live in the desert. For anyone over 40, Disney and the Mutual Wild Omaha Kingdoms provide much of our insight into wild animals since childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Planet Animal. What is still fascinating is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic animals. Watching the elephant trudge for days, almost delirious from the lack of water, is oh so painful. But night fight against the lions are thrilling. Some of the underwater vaccines are breathless. Mum and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching its great white shark attack is every bit as chilling as "jaws". The most amazing scenery for me was the enchanting views of the Himalayas. I have never seen details of the vastness of the range. <br /> Do not think most teenagers today will be too excited by this one, but surely it is one of the most beautiful photographic documentaries I've ever seen.
