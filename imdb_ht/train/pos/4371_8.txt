When braveheart first came out, I was enthralled, and he admits one of the most riotous fans in the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued, and although I enjoyed the movie I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time went by, my appreciation for Rob Roy grew, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished. Braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are flaws as well. Most importantly, in my view, is the unflattering painting of Robert Bruce, who was without a greater doubt to King Scotland. Another is the historical infidelity of the film, which tarnish the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. I think I was also bothered by the fact that he was in this movie, seeing only (at least not me) in retrospect, which begins at Melancholy Melbourne's Melancholy can be seen clearly for the first time. Conversely, Rob Roy grew up over me during the years. In part because it largely avoids the flaws I think most of Braveheart. However, because Rob Roy is like good wine, growing more mature and complex with every look.
