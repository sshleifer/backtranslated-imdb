This film is a real show of the unspoiled and self-governed way of society. It has many characters and each and every character represents a different category of people. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and characters have no 100% malicious rather than all are just different. The film is a very good mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that raised some social issues. I would recommend everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist covering the hip-tremorous parts of Bollywood for the newspaper, but it's the story of how it gets a crime reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all, then it shows how it could not survive and when it helped save some innocent children, how roughly his voice was suppressed. Even he fired at the job. Then he could not find a job of crime reporter and he must do more. Not only is it a very large number of characters mingled in the movie and all give different feel while watching the movie. I would really commend the director for making such a big movie. Please do not pay them to miss it.
