When the epidemic broke out of New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark in the rescue of "Panic in the Streets," one of the smaller-celebrated films in the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps the speed of speed, and there are many great things - the scene between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene at police stations shows family life and working life with the average citizen relationship, which is in contrast The sharpness of life and the life of the low life, described by a menacing Jack Palance, weakly respondents, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palans have a couple of scenes and actors who seem to come to his knees in height. <br /> <br /> The act is wonderful with the sharp dialogue if the story is not quite up toward performance and performance. It has a few skeptic aspects that will be spotted by the viewer easily. That aside, it's well worth watching. Kazan was a master's director.
