The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive sally sally's mind is enough reason to be alone enjoying this movie, but wait! There are more! This is a great good breakthrough in daylight TVs, movie stars along the way down, (and up) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. The dialogue is witty, and the physical humor is done with full competency. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the art, directing, and writing.
