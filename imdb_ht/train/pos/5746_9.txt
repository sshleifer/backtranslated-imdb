Words are badly not enough to transmit the emotional power of this movie; It's one of the most wrenching you'll ever see, yet the finish is one of the favorite, sensitive, and emotionally complete you might expect. Each actor in each role is terrific, especially a wise and understated Jamie Lee Curtis, a bright and painful wound of Ray, with a turn-left turn from Tom Hulce who should have made him up for every award the book. (It is # 1 chosen for Best Actress 1988 by Danny Peary at "Old Oscars.") Last hour in half border on melodrama, but the film touches one of her tears - and unless you're done in rock, there will be many of them.
