"Boat Ahoy" was probably done in order to show MGM talent. The movie is a fun trip on an offshore liner on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time in which the country participated in WWII. This typical fare for the studio, which provided the film to publicly light light entertainment as a distraction during the hard times the country lived. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Eleanor Powell sees in her best in some music numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be identified with. Red Skelton is also seen in a straightforward part and not too much clowning, as it is beautiful Mrs. Powell's on the ship that will lead to Puerto Rico. Irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the movie to show he was a funny man. Also, Virginia Gray is seeing a fun girl who is not deceived by anyone. There are good music numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and her orchestra, in which one sees, among others, Buddy Rich's amazing, who has a few solos and Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the lead singer in the band, backed by the Pied Pipers. This is a nostalgic journey that should be savored by fans of this genre, which MGM totally controls.
