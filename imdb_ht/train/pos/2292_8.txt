Just watch this early bunny (the first time he's called here) and Elmer Fudd's cartoon on the ThadBlog as linked from YouTube. The first time Chuck Jones was headed "wascally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has a different voice that Mel Blanc gives than our one more Brooklyn / Bronx. In fact, according to Thad, he channeling Jimmy Stewart (his "timid boy" kind personality at that time). Anyway, after Elmer bought his pet, Bugs went all obnoxious on him by turning the real radio loud, pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and said "These lights are! " Each time Elmer captures him in his bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is definitely herself mischievous and I laugh myself blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer just to give the Bugs home after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffered a mental breakthrough at that point is just as well as cut scene is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
