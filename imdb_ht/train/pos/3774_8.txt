At the end of the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, like evil Chuck De nomolos sends out evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted on earth to kill human bill with Ted, in order to change the future. <br /> In a great comedy, Winter and Reeves thrill delivers the delicious humorous audience to the end of this fun. Though missing the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogues from the leading pair, not to mention a hilarious performance by William Sadler, who brings a comic face to the depth, dream of grimace. Look for the game sequences, the best moment in the movie all but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre. Even though still busy with humor, this film has a more dramatic movie towards it, with the greatest advantage and the most risky situation. <br /> <br /> This gives the full-size movie and another lovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the genre of fantasy and the use of realism, and hell and the sky were heavily symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is yet to spot over and use in that amazing time traveling car, though yet somewhat confusing of points and the use of timing, and objects and situations being put before it happens in the present, as is the obvious the final couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> Look at first I was hated this weekend, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and more stories, and even though the jokes and draws are not as strong as predecessors its, Bogus Journey has enough feeling good motive, jokes and a fairly unusual scheme to make it a good natured family movie.
