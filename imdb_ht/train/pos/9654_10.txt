Stephane Rideau has already been a star for her tour of "Wild Reeds," and she is one of Africa's largest indie stars. In this movie, she plays Cedric, a local boy who meets Mathieu vacation (Newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced, ethereal performance) at the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with her sick mother, asking aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Director Sebastian Lifshitz does not signal our time-to-day, and the story line can be hard to follow. But stick it out: The Final Movie 45 minutes are so engrossing that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. When they turn heart-breaking and uplifting, this film runs with "wonderful" ways to watch movies.
