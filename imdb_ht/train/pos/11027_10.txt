Since I first saw this in the theater it was my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it. The environment has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the scenario is original and I liked how it used mountain hills as heroes. There was not a movie I can compare this too. John Lithgow plays a cleverly clever, but I love how he is completely out of his element - he's tucker around and that keeps it interesting. This is a movie action in it's best. I do not think I'll see another that is so entertaining. <br /> You do not need 50,000 judges fired to be eligible as a movie action. It just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.
