This movie, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris has dreamed not only for himself, but for his family. I can not start telling you how I could tell my girl that dad went to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs. It would have thought it was the coolest thing, like Morris' son did. Dreams of living with family are what this one is about. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
