If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz to die. Just like Tom Stoppard's movies, we get to see the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: Timon, the Meerkat and a Trend for breaking through the song of a hat, and Pumbaa, Wardog and flatulence problems. By following the stories - rather than the Simba - we get to see why all the animals are bent themselves as Simba was introduced to Rock Pride. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to proud pride in reversing scars. And we find out how they deal with the iena at once for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets stronger in the best jokes, but he is skillfully supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg repeat their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend different voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the stop-start-fast-fast-forward device that does not always help the story progress. After saying that, there is a brilliant pull near the beginning of the movie. With more laughter than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene that is still funny despite being slightly predictable.
