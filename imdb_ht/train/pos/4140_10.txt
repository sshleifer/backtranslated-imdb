What an amazingly funny and original show. Throw in to start with the surprise of Julie Brown (Got the Queen Got a Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who is still discussing with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN) I was laughing harder during this show than any Other I've ever seen (including Newhart-one of my favorite show ever) If you like cinemas like nude guns and aircraft- you'll love this series ... One of the best moments of shows is Cindy Williams playing herself. Cleaner, Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her dress .. The picture is in Cindy Williams doing an unmentionable act with a pin-pin bow downward .. She is afraid to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to play herself like this. Such opera and torsion surprise so much during its short run. I can only hope that this day will be released on DVD and special bonus special features .. My heavy series ever seen !!!!
