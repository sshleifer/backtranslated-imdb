OK, it's not a perfect movie by any means but I agree with IMDb views overall that it's really really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era of dear. I never saw 'Black Mask' at the moment and only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from copying the DVD that does not give me the option to close, the movie has the raw and bravado energy that penetrates Hong Kong movies during that time. I always keep my gun in view that, when it comes to action, these guys do not matter what budgets, adding a component of the magic screen does not have any bourne supremacy, royalty casino or mission impossible (i do not hit the harder They are movies - I just struggled to miss the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will never be achieved. What is it? She feels that the movie-makers have experienced similar shooting and edited, not afraid to leave in some blemishes as learning lessons for the next time. For me, this makes watching movies, all the more fun and dangerous.
