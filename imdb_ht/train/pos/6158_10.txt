What can I say about a story like this? This magical story has followed me from my childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to many fantasy places to make you want more in each scene. For example in the market there were many different flavors of lore. I liked the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was wonderful I wanted so bad for Landsbury to decide to keep children prey and also stay with Mr.Brown, and find the other half of the spell so that the men less gun can win the war. <br /> I'm still a child inside, and this movie appeals to my inner kids like no other. This movie is my favorite ever. I hope all kids will be able to watch this classic and be swept away, and transport at another time.
