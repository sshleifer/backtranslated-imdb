You love to really invent comedy or love the "wedding crashers", if the answer is the latest reading now. I can not believe that this film is no longer rated. Basically meadows play a character not unlike Austin Power. There are many inventing the moment of gagorama. From crudity - Leon plays with his head on the porch, the former companion tricked into food. . Oh well. To inspire lunacy-clown gender, the Broadway routine, the voice over. Meadows are great as children but very sweet natured Leon. There are some big lines "do not blame the wang" "freaky of sex world" too many. . . Why this movie was not great is a mystery. Great comedy.
