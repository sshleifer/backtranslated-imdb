Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is put, nothing will be able to stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben was not planning to fall in love with one of these people and is the one who will end up transforming it. Will Smith is back again with Director Gabriele Muccino, after life inspired the film "The Early Prose". "Seven books" is yet another life-changing movie experience, which not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, tremendous, but inspiring or happy at the end. Will Smith, is also the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, which depicts a common person's life and struggles with life. Seven books may have taken some time to get it in current momentum, but just after half an hour into the movie, the movie is all along with your heart rules. Also, this movie has some twists around, allowing viewers to hold puzzle. Director Gabriele Muccino once again is the winner along the way, with his emotional message yet again inspired. It makes all the characters in the movie very real, that people would actually find themselves in a place of the movie. Together with the director, Will Smith is yet another winner, with his superb skills to act. Again, the duo of the director and the actor is working as a charm. Also, there are other talented actors in the movie that were part of them very well. Rosario Dawson, beauty and brain, is what she can call. It looks nice & does it very well. Barry Pepper, giving a great support to the movie & Woody Harrelson doing the same, although Woody did not have a lot of distribution screen (would be good if he had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie & change your life. Top class movies!
