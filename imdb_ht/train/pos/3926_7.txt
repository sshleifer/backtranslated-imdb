Because of this is a rather funny little shopping supermarket as a period / biopic drama. However the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda was really like in his picks. I was not disappointed - it produces a really hot and charismatic performance. <br /> In addition I can honestly say that I never really bored at any stage during the movie, so a strong *** 1/2 from *****
