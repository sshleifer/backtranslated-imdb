"9/11," hosted by Robert DeNiro, featuring outdoor and indoor twin towers in New York, on September 11, 2001. <br /> Never too grisly and gory, but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. Anyone who does not move does not show that this TV is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
