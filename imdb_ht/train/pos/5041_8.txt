Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Power Boothe) at his FBI office. It claims to have information about a serious assassin pursued by FBI. When Silver Doyle came to the office, he told her that the killer assassin is his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: my father's widow (Bill Paxton), her brother and herself. One night, his father assembled two brothers and told them that an angel had just visited him and gave his family to destroy the demons. What's next is one of the most scary films I have ever seen. <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I watched again, now on DVD. Although being a low-budgetary film, the scenario is sharp, with no flaws. Throw is outstanding, but I would like to emphasize the performance of Matt O'Leary as the fast Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be done by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great first behind the camera. I'm sorry to write this Brazilian title: 'A Mao do Diabo' (but the Devil). If at least it was 'God in hand,' it would be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the hand of the devil' is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the seniorist, did not deserve such a disrespect to the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mao Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
