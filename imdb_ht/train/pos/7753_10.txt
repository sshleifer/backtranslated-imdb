This Belgian movie, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known dEUS group, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason that there is not a clear story or even a draw. This movie just shows 24 hours of "a town" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and really enjoy the dialogues, directing the comic (Dario, Bruno's osteopath!, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) character. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS-fan, Windman visiting the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly some other viewers did not, understand what's so cute and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no history, etc. But the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you to it. If you did not look it again, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary just like Tom Barman and his group. <br /> And "ssst, monde dicht h√©." (do not say anybody)
