ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it presents me the Ramones. I was too small during the mid-midnight 70s to be very aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan of the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television an afternoon in the mid 80s when I was about fifteen years old, and laughed all the way into it. (Is not all kid's kid's dreams in his school garbage and blow it up, all wearing a Rockin 'band?) I recorded a subsequent relief from the movie a year or two later and kept watching the sequences Ramones concert on and over again, thinking "Man, these guys kick ass! I have to check out some of the albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, surrounded by Ramones LPs / tapes / CDs, and three Ramones show later, they're still one of my favorite group ever and RNRHS still craves every time I watch it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all) at least we have this movie with tons of great music to remember.
