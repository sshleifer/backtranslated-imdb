I've just seen this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where he plays under Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason why I went for this movie was because she shared her name with the radiohead song, and also because my friends bought the tickets for me really did not have a choice : -They went on waiting for it to be something like the silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be semi-gore flicker. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are unmatched, and that is absolutely correct. I really could not care less if Potente's character came in to tear out the creep. I was homeschooling to make it out alive with Potente's character getting her dessert right now. Christopher Smith has certainly done a good job with visual aspects of the movie. However, the story is rather weak, but then again the whole point in the film scared the crap out of you and he did so quite effectively. Score by a bristol band called Insects was headache. That, more than anything, really scared the crap out of me. The director was a really decent chapel and was quite fun during the Q & A session. I really hope she gets better movie in the future. <br /> This one is strictly for genre fan, but I would recommend that not fans give this try anyway. It was a fun ride.
