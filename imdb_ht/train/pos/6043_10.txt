I saw the movie freebird and its great thinking! fun to put back, over time the British movie industry came in with something fun !! good to read how the guy who met at the service station came to mention the way in the movie of the news agents, beautifully touched. The act was convinced (I'm a biker) they reminded me of some good times I had at the bike scene. It was good to see the movie director getting into acting, well done rushes! At the end of a new crop to mention, in Ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film? hope to keep them coming. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
