Beautiful movie, most Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland provides a stunning performance in a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. He tries to save his own subconscious ghost, embodied by the death of a teenage girl. Acceptance of himself, in human condition, even if its general difficulty, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater and film sequences itself is puzzling: it's as if the step became a way out for the heroine. If all American movies could only be quality, deal with human relationships on an adult level, do not try to enfantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best plays ever. 10/10.
