This has to be one of the best movies from HK in a long time, I have been waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. Charges of fantastic actors in this show and I was particularly impressed with Lee Lee's behavior behaviors being impossibly credited with painting the Edison in a bloodthirsty car, which totally reversed its normal idol image. I would definitely recommend giving people looking for a stylish movie and charging action. However, I must warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, as every character in the film is of some type of end death and problem of their own, and struggling to breathe. Make you think about what life really is.
