Bela Lugosi has appeared in several of these low budget drivers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and Vanishes in Cadenza is one of the best ones. Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts the body fluids so she can keep her aging young woman. After a reporter and a doctor stay overnight at her home and discover it is responsible for her husband's death, this morning reported the murder of the police and the angry scientist was shot dead and died shortly thereafter. <br /> <You've got almost everything in this film: The scientist's assistant is comprised of an old, a humpback and dwarf (his son), a thunderstorm and spooky at Bela's home. Bela and his wife get to sleep better in cats than bedding in the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanishes in Kadesh is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun. <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
