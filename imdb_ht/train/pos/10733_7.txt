Watching this movie again really brings back some great childhood memories. I'm 34 now, have not seen it since I was 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it again lately, some scenes literally brought a tear in my eye! That little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was just like reviewing my kids. It was a really amazing experience for me. I will always take care of this movie for this reason. I hope some of your readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular movie, but any movie you have not seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Living for reading
