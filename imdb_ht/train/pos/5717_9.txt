Omigosh, this is seriously the hideous movie I've ever seen, ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an understatement, and I've seen piles (considering the limited availability of New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before I had to sleep with the light on ... until I saw the Grudge. <br /> Some may say that it is a rip off of the ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both lines that are similar (yet different) stories, but the woe keeps its own as a stressful The movie - see in the movie, I even scream at a certain point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The act is great, particularly in the characters supported - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, it is such a very enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother seems to have fun. However, while I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she does not really look like this movie. Of the characters supported, it probably had much more depth and the story came back, but it does not seem like it is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she remains the same throughout her movie and her role? The ghosts were really scared, the effects of music and sounds were refrigerated (particularly the noise made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in his apartment), the finish was also cool. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
