I remember this movie for many years. Certainly the best movie on the subject of my experience. The fact that I shine to remember so much of the movie after a while testifying its impact. <br /> It is difficult to comment on performance levels because of the language barrier. But they were very powerful. This topic will continue to captivate you and pass through the years. And it was more efficiently treated here, with the proper proportion of historical and doubtful perspectives. <br /> I wish he could show on television at least once. Or at least be available on tapes or DVDs. Or is it? Is there some art film archive for a copy of it ??
