I also liked this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was one to play by Marion Lorne as a rather stingy, bumbling and very adorable "aunt" kind of person. I can still remember her "ubba bubba um um" kind of comment as she would try and say something important. Then when he returned and played aunt Clara in shelter he was great casting! <br /> It was the first time that I can remember seeing Walter Matthau whose career I follow as a fan for many years. <br /> I have a question whether one can verify: was the title or end of music "Swedish Rhapsody" music by Hugo Alfven? Whenever I heard he was playing on my classic radio station here in Southern California he brought back memories of the image of sequined men walking away with his back in the camera. I'm not sure if this image in my head is correct.
