Let me set the stage. It is school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the movies. I and my friends decide what to see. We look for a movie that begins soon and the "Grinch" comes up. We buy tickets do not know what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun. <br /> Jim Carrey (who can add me is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the grinch of Ron Howard's best film (next to Apollo 13). The way the film was made, the scenery, actors, accessory and music were just amazing. She really brought this movie to kids in life. <br /> The story is based on the story of Grinch. As we all know Grinch is a terrible person who just can not stand Christmas. He lives high above whoville and does not mix well with the vilfolk. But a girl who will change Grinch's look on life and others in a radical way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the grinch as finding part of her kind straight. She tries to break the barrier and help Grinch move in and mix with the city people. <br /> All up this movie is a barrel of laughter for the whole family of children and their parents. A 10/10 solid. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
