Unborn is a wonderful good low-budget film exploiting fears associated with pregnancy. It's very well-done by Brooke Adams's still-good and b-movie stalwart James Karen, although cast in support is pretty average for a b-grade. The music, by Gary Numan in all, is good too. Henry Dominic script is quite clever for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. Rodman Fender's direction is simply adequate, and there are some unnecessary misfortunes. If you're an Adams fan, whose film career is nowhere near as illustrative as it should, check it out; it is great, as always.
