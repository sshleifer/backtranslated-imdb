"Dangerous Offenders" is a story of an anti-social girl, and how she got that way. It is based on a true story, and even though I was irritated by the one-note illustration that all the time, in the title character, and the hard-to-believe devotion of his lawyer, I was forced to accept that life imitates art, and that people are out there like that. The movie succeeds, for me, because, although there is little softening in the character's style attitude until almost at the end, one gradually moved to sympathy for her, as the movie shows how it happened in its current state the - proven to be self-destructive, rather than anti-social. <br /> <br /> Surely a moving movie, which will carry a ball in your throat, when you think about it - that will often. Despite its many shortcomings, (including that it's hard to look at, sometimes because of body functions, and suicide attempts), this is another production that I am proud to call Canadian.
