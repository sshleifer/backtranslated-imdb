Prince star as the 'kid' of this semi-autobiographical film in a talented, but narcissistic young musician with a lesser life then starved home. The real actor left a tad to be willing (preventing Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams that both separated perfect), but the film is still great and among the best from the 1980s. It has the best band of any movie in the last 50 years at least, very quotable lines, and the deposit scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is just merely crouch. On an Associate by, when I saw the Prince Prince in 2004 he blew down the stadium. It is an expert exhibit and it was one of the best concerts that I experienced. <br /> <br /> My lesson: A DVD <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary and Director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo, & Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Theater Trailer; Trailer for the "Under Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12 minute featured at the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Stage Bachstage (an hour featurette on the movie which I will review later on his page)," Rif, Raffs, and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Red Rain "10 minutes featurette; 30 minutes of Premiere MTV's Footage (when MTV did not suck donkey donkeys); 5 Music Videos Prince (Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With You, When We Cry Right, I'd Die 4 U / Baby I'm A Star, And Rain Red ); by the time (love jungle and the bird); and a music video for "Sniper Sex" by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Candy eye: Apollonia shows its tits fine ass
