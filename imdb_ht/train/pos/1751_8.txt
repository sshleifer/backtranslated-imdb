The 40-year-old Virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year old man working in an electronic store and not having a lot of social and very awkward lives around women. Some of his co-workers at the store invited her out one night and discovered that Andy is still a virgin to plan to help her lose her girl. One day at the store Andy, meeting a woman called Trish, who gave her phone number and eventually Andy, worked up enough to go on a date with her and start really like each other but Andy, always very awkward when it comes to sex and she will have to say this Trish, much of her embarrassment if she can actually get up enough to tell her before things get awkward. The 40-year-old Virgin, has good direction, a good script, good performance comedy by the whole cast, good movies and good movie editing. The movie stars and is co-written by Steve Carell, who makes a very good performance performance tool and writes it to the movie is also very good. I was very jamy surprised by this movie. It's sweet, funny, fun, fun, enjoyable, smart, good natured and a good time. This movie is just as good wedding crashers this year, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen in a moment. The 40-year-old Virgin, really exhibiting a lot of talent and is set to use good and works as a comedy with a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
