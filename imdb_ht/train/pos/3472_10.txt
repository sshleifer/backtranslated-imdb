Very Slight Spoiler <br /> This movie (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I did not really pay attention to the differences in looks or accent, so I can not really comment on that. The act of this was so good I had to pinch myself and say "Remember, it`s only a movie, this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN". As I sat down and listened to Harris and Quinn, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul were talking about having actually had this meeting. The trading and burning reviews from John were right on with his character (especially in the restaurant!), As his depression was during Paul's very easy going and putting back. Both actors did with excellent work and I was thrilled to see this movie. It `a vicious experience for any Beatles fans. And prepare for a few surprises!
