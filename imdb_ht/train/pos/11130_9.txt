Jon Voight is brilliant at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn of Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, the portrayal of Bill Butcher's portrayal of Bill Butcher in New York has come to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character to emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> It is typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the story of the movie playing at those around him in such a way that it increases their performance far higher than normal levels. <br /> <br /> Buck Voight is so naive that it would float out of the movie altogether, except that Ratso pulled it down - pull it down, but also taught it, a lot about how survive and, most importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about the escape that gets into a movie about finding yourself. I think, as fearless a movie like it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a deficit you might (Ratso clearly defines "deficit"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself , you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. I can not help but compare the Cowboy Midnight Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself getting into a movie about to escape.
