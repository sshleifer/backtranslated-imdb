I thought that this movie was very enjoyable. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. Therefore, I did not watch it as simply family entertainment and I always enjoy it. It seems as though many of the reviews are showing that this film is not earth shattered, there was no unexpected scheme changes and that the movie was predictable and boring. If these people were watching this film hoping to have a religious experience doing so, then they obviously will be disappointed. This is simply an animated movie; nothing more. If you want to see this movie simply sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. In closing, this is definitely not the best Disney movie made, but it is fun and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
