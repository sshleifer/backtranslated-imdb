I noticed the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between posted in the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another scene is as during the failures of the simulation, Kevin becomes Joaquin I think that the VHS edition other than ABC in one might have everything missing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise I like to know which DVDs have missing things. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched was edited for TV.
