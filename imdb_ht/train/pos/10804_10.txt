Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switch to the channel that shows this at the very beginning. First, the Canon Pachelbel was carrying a ball in my throat, then the eye of a Tiger glass (which my grandfather, my father and I have all fly) produced a slight moisture in the eyes and then , The name of the Crowe completely echoes me. I was drawn by this movie, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and yes, what a debt we owe), how the various affairs were addressing and dealing with, the flying sequences (my father 'flew Avro Ansons, too), history - and, as another contributed to point out, Crowe's summary of high flights. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone, but separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as a senior military officer being deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilots, I admit to crying joy a couple of times . Buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but look it up. <br /> PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training color) on the ground? Look like a twin-engine jet and a twin-303 brownings in a dorsal turret.
