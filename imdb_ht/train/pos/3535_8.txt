** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. I'm glad I did that. <br /> First, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are in a party in London, and some evil men break it by kidnapping the daughter of the Prime Minister. Of course you must save it, and it is quite a great level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think also part of funniest, is when you're in the jet-pack, and the people rappelling down Big Ben. Just equipped rocket launchers the most trusted jet-pack and blast the clock facing the enemies down. Most fun! <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but very short. There are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the downs left, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock them just 'kill 25 enemy targets', I mean, c' mon! We had loads of points to unlock the missions and the two bonuses missions that are past are really bad! The multi player, me and some of my friends agree, are very good and challenging, though there are no bots. Halo had no robots but that's always some fun entertaining gameplay! You can be a charge of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill without going through the look of the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus mission might improve). Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (need no comments, just great, you get the jet-pack drive and car). Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (the only levels I'm back on are the level of Loondon and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <You might have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.
