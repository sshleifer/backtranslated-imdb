This documentary-drama is what you would expect of Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, cast composting, well written in the way that Hollywood abandoned in the 30's, and exactly accurate. It is meant as a genre film, excellent in its portrayal of native Native Americans (or, more appropriate for its Canadian environment, "First UN") culture and standing with "Black Robe" as a beautiful piece of photographs of land kanoas and its culture (here, about 1934). This portrait idylically drives out the drama of her subjects: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scottish Scotts Rise in Hastings (England) by a young woman who became so obsessed with the "red Americans" stories of her childhood that she was gone in Canada, disappeared in woods, and became a trapper and adopted a son Ojibway. It was a prosperous man with a habit of getting married and abandoned <br /> <br /> American brides, none of whom seemed to think less of him for it, because it was also an extraordinary charm and picaresque character. One of his wife (one smarter than he, not most) throws him to fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North, and this focuses on the history of Attenborough la. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Gray's wife corrects) is engaged and, if not fire, is well handled. A good movie when you need some time in the madding crowd.
