Pecker is a hilariously funny comedy yet twisted movie about a small town in Baltimore that has everyday, humdrum routine broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "the real things." No beautiful patterns, no gorgeous men, just hard living. This wonderful movie pokes the pleasure of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is only one particular scene when a homeless woman who stores the pecker's mommy store mate bought the exact same dress as one of the Whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you might not always have flavor. But again John Waters sent you to a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw facts. You can have your Hollywood main movie and special effects with celebrity hills, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) on a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" anyday !!
