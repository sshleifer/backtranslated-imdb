I read some commentary before stating that this movie has lost steam towards the end of the movie and also has a similar finish to Cape Scary. I fully agree. I'll give a simple review of the normal movies out there. I thought the filing was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What is an evil psychopath !!! I have great respect for her acting after watching her performance in this film. I was riveted throughout this film. If you like mystery erison then this is definitely a movie you want to see. I even noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of top stars and I highly recommend it!
