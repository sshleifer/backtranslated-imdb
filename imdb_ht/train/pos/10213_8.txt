This fantasy film was the misfortune of being released at the same time at the very popular "Amelie", both of which have wonderful Audrey Tautou to play the central role. Laurent Firode, talented director, made one of the most enjoyable films that came from France in recent memories. The film deals with luck, as its English title indicates. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can create disruption on the Atlantic as they fly, as well as the Pacific hurricane, something that should not be believed just by looking at these colorful insects. From the outset, the director interlaces all the one characters seen in the movie and how each has a connection to the other, something hard to imagine, but in the context of the film seems to work well. A lucky meeting at the Metro sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is going to work, was asked by the woman to sit opposite him telling him what his zodiac sign was and read in his paper. Irene, she seems to cross the path and will find her soul companion on that same day. After Irene left the train, the quiet man sitting beside the woman said she had the same date as Irene. It seems to be destined to each other from the outset, but alas, will not reconnect until the last frame of the movie. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful like Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but it shows he has a presence and plays well his part. Young talented youth make a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is like lightning butterfly wings. <br /> We look forward to the future movie by Laurent Firode because it seems to be a director with the heart of the right place and an ear in how people are connected.
