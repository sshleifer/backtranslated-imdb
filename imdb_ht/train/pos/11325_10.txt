When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I said that from all the shows that I saw, this one itself is all there. I saw this show, and that's what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really love the animation, and all the battles of the fears were scared. I said that my favorite character in the show was Saber, and Archer and of course I also love Illya. And of course, all the episodes on traders were interesting, and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers, and others) playing the voice of Berserker. It has a cool character. And I even watch the whole series again on the final volume view. So if you see something good, then see this show, it's the best.
