Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman: Dead End that just helps stimulate our taste buds and let us want more! This is a real superhero movie should look like feel like! Even this trick is a fan of the type. The attention to detail features, characters and actions is definitely real. Although this is a limited resource production, it puts shame great budget, star-throw, hyped production of "other" superhero-related movies. Here are the main characters and support acting and look like they are real life people. Finally, a superman who actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the nozzle-dropping tire, tear gun weapons to hide scrawny physics for paying off non-rescue actors. I just want that some sensitive British Warner gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this jewelry. I do not care if it goes to the theater or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth the hard I've earned dough for that. Expect the "Bigwigs" in Marvel & DC production to take a look and see what a real real movie produces superhero should look. No more "Batman & Robin" Fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these small directors time and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just have it "bomb" in the theater. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you!
