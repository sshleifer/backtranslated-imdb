It is a superb Swedish movie ... it was the first Swedish film I saw .. it is simple & deep .. a great combination! Michael Nyqvist has made a great performance as a famous conductor seeking peace in his own country. Frida Hallgren was great as her inspirational girlfriend helped her bring on & never give up. The battle between the conductor and hypocrite priest lost his fight with Michael when his wife met him and defend Michael's noble cause to help his hometown to find their own peace of music. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I did not like was ended .. it was not that good but it has some deep meaning.
