I saw this film on True Movies (which automatically made me uncertain) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogues (in which there is little) but because actually, despite what people say I thought the movie was accurate in its illustration of adolescent dealing with pregnancy. <br /> The Creek Dawson, are not graceful, cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality and easy knowledge. They are children and they act like children. <br /> <br /> They're weak, awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes, this might not crash and they might just be a bad actor but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very credible performance and I love him for it. Patricia Arquette SE is blurry and annoying, but was pregnant with adolescents? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable but so what? I believe, his stress, his inability to cope - brave it, but a little misguided attempt to bring them closer together. I think that the characters, acting by anyone else, would indeed have been annoying and incredible but they did not. She reflected the success of the situation in, that she was sitting in class and she was walking on campus with the baby. I felt angry at it, and I felt angry at being like a child and blaming her. I felt it all .. <br /> In the end, I liked it, it would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Look out for the stage where Dermot Mulroney runs out of the disaster counseling session - career performance.
