Along with Darkwing Duck this unjustly canceled. Disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sound familiar?) Theme theme tunes are also catchy. From all the villains, which are all great on their own basis, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the overshooting voices of the Jungle book, which is not a bad thing at all. As a matter of fact, it's quite inspirational! The animation was spot-on, and the script was very understandable that it was a lot of animation for years. PLEASE DO THIS HELP! 9/10. Bethany Cox
