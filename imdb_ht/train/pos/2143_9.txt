It's not the same with the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves in dancing. Contrary to the movies dancing in Hollywood, the characters in this movie are not cute or hot young people. They are a person that you can see everyday in your office. They have some depression on their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams come out of dancing. This touches me deeply.
