My observation: afterwards later. Tom Drake and Dad from "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed nice and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton is still good; smaller part of the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington beautiful way, also with the pride of the little percussion missing by Hamilton. Tent scene at the end with the old boy next door was hilarious. As a veteran of the tent year, she looked very juvenile and inexperienced when I looked into her eyes. <br /> I used to work in a department store, and it was just as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, it has disappeared and faded into obscure. We were famous for those big show windows that were used to lobby passers in the store, to get them to buy all the wonderful things. <br /> <br /> 10/10
