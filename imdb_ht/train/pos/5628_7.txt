Having watched some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are attracted to their own way - the beautiful "victim", and the beautiful, obviously very "off-center," blue-collar protagonist (if just short of "totally disrupted") - take turns smashing the hell out of each other, sort of like a Kabuki Kabuki storyline. <br /> <br /> This is all right, and that is, of course, especially a "turn-tablet" story. However, my referencing complaint is that I believe the director has kept-up of his desire to show the well-known physical attributes of Farrah. Starting with it was enticingly clad in a thin cloth, and with a number of scenes that show more than needed for any dramatic effect - while incredibly pleasing to the eyes, these are distracted from the level of poignancy of the drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> came to them locally and only the worst of intentions, and that it would have absolutely no reason to overdo what was happening. <br /> But this is a movie and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.
