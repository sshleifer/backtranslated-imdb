I just looked at Fisher on BRAVO. What an awesome movie with incredible young man. This film is a must see for anyone dealing with how to overcome child abuse and abandon as an adult. Denzel Washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Fisher. Kleenex Alert - Feels good and tearful. The earliest moment is when she finally meets her mother, whom she took away in at 2 months of age. And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister. I saw this film on Bravo in 2008 and only want I knew about it years ago. Definitely a movie adds to my DVD collection.
