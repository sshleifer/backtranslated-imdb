I loved this movie very much. It's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing film action action in your brain. A lot of their character's origins and motivations are like waves, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. It's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make their own minds. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge, or a desire to repent - it does what he feels is "right". 'Has God forgave us for what we did?' - It's not a deadly question to answer - so he does what he feels he did, what he's good at, what he trained to do. <br /> <br /> Denzel washington is a great actor - I honestly can not think of one bad movie he did - and he had a great cast of support. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
