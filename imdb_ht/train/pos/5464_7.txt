Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck shouted the film where he said that the type of local teacher had power - he tried to get it read Nietzche - saying he never did it wrong. Remember we found his father is basically pimping it out of a local politico and others.Finally he had enough and moved to the big city. We followed his trail to climb up the ladder to the success of an international bank. Dialogue is well saucy for her in time and one recent film has come out before producing Hollywood's own production.Look for a comedge by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's unwanted victims. Part of the collection bans Hollywood - i See the extended version-DVD has both more Red-headed versions of Women and Waterloo Bridge. An exciting movie for the Future Femme fatal film that Stanwyck would play in the era of noir movie. B +
