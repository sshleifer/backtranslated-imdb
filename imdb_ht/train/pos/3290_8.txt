Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the way to form, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect him in real life - especially involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) that he meets in his dreams. <br /> Very unusual fantasy and some really terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this is about a young girl and has a rating PG-13, this is NOT for the kids. Also, if you hate imagination stay away. But if you're game for something different this fits the bill. <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with a pretty nice music note and a few nice, scary shooters. The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke - it's not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this was her only movie) and it hurts the movie. However, everyone else is just great. <br /> <br /> Very good spiers as Mark; Glenne Headley (faking a British accent very well) is also good as Anna's mother and Ben Cross are both scary and sympathetic to Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A sleeper hit when released in 1988, it's been since faded away. That's too bad - it's really pretty good.
