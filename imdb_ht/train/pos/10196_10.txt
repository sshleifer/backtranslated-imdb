Kudos Cesar Montano revives the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy that Suba is very good - it has drama, action, romance, and scenes that will make you laugh. While the story is not original (a love triangle - or making a four-corner-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as Lord), its presentation is something fresh, especially it uses it original language - bisaya for Filipino , nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American. <br /> This movie will go as one of the best pinoy movies this year. <br /> Go look at that!
