I liked this movie! It is really rare, very funny, morbid, witty ... It makes no sense to say about the content of the movie, because then I should give out the result! You have to see it without knowing what it's about! Everything is connected and has its why and because. It starts subtly and then things start rolling faster and faster until they finish the most crazy blast you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the movie a second, once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real master piece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
