This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" is my favorite movie Sammo Hung. The Fat Dragon is fat in this outing than it was in Condors, but it is no less sure-foot as director or actor. It is, in fact, in mind in its form and deliver a devastating, brutal shareholder who has a lot of dozen amazing sequences and manages to say a compassion, sweet love story too. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but are used as curious adjuncts in the action and ensure that viewers do not hit the fast-forward button between the physical clash. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a funny light saber duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedical is pursued by a very well-scanned and sweaty car with a sharp, funny tone. Fighting fast and furious between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easy one of the best ever of its kind. Violence of the film is increasing slowly until, finally, when the climatic confrontation comes, we have undergone some of the most brutal discussions ever seen in a Sammo production. The director's actor / actor on Billy Chow and a home full of angry, menacing opponents are a bone-split, physically punishable. <br /> <br /> Terrific on each level and one of the best martial arts movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Great note, too.
