Amazing effects for a movie at that time. A kindergarten of unnecessary wars and how wars become a nursery in itself. <br /> Something wonderful about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive.org. No charge, no sign up is needed. Watch it in one sitting, and you'll be launched. <br /> I plan to share this flick with many people as possible as I have never heard of it before and I'm a basic hard topic. br> <br /> I would like to see how others react to this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it. <br /> <br /> Say it. what you think.
