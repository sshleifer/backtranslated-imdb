The first two sequences in this film set up two conflicts: the -that-conflict between soldiers soldier and suppressed humankind, and the physicist -physikal conflict between Todd and its bio-inertia replacement. Both sequences are quite attractive in different ways. Peoples' feodor falters a bit by solving the first of these half-way arches of the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action action. However, Kudos gives the musicians the opportunity to create a piece of genre and heart and even a bit of souls and especially Kurt Russell who translated many and very little. big movie, but one is worth seeing.
