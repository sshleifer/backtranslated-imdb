CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to look for many reasons. Acting in Clara Lago is simply amazing for such a young person, and it is one of those special actors who can say so much with facial expressions. Director of Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no breaks of continuity, thereby pushing the scheme at a fixed speed and just enough suspension to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring. Movies of Angel Garcia Roldan is telling stories of its best, which, it seems, is the main goal for film after all. The plot is unpredictable, but the events as they unravel are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this movie is if you tell a story of the Hispanic Civil War as it affects the people. It was a great event in the 20th century, but hardly any Indian knows about it. In fact, in 40 years of university teaching, I was able to use one semester to even listen to it, much less anyone who can say anything full of it - and the overwhelming number of students were deserving of science, all people speak in the enormous amount of censorship of American education. So, in one way, this movie is a great way to start a study on this event, keeping in mind that when one thread pulls a great deal of history is unraveled. The appreciation of this movie is, therefore, in direct relation to the one's knowledgeable amount. To see this movie as another coming to the movie movie is missing the movie completely. The index of elbow left is seven aspects of film - acting, laying production, character development, drawing, dialogue, film continuity, and artistry - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for average, and 1 for need of help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average on all counties, except dialogues that are rated as average. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, raised by a 10 time synonym in the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
