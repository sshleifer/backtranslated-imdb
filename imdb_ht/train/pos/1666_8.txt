This is a film about 17th-Century Italian artist and a particular artist, a woman Artemisia, an unusual profession for women at that time, and she dared to paint the naked man's details of his unique muscles. <br /> The camera work is primarily indoors for which is where artists are mostly working. There are some great shots. The light candle shutter suggests the beautiful work of the classic painters and it is fascinating to look at the painters and students supported by elaborate scaffold brushes in details of the religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the movie (costumes, faces, make-up) are quite superbly authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all the details of the frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is being asked by his father to study under the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who became expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but the unsuspecting Artemisia is presenting more than new painting techniques. After possessing it, Tassi violates her violation. Her father outraged. Court proceedings are followed. This romantic drama has a fairly simple story and a satisfying finish. The outstanding feature of the movie is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women run through a garden and the wind blows its volume dress to add wonderful effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she painted herself; Her father painted to please others. As for this movie, it will please most, I think.
