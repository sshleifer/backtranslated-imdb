This is just a great, fun, beautiful movie. It captures true meaning of the decade and the people, and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters and two navy. Though this film can only be black and white, it definitely does not count against it now in modern days. The main purpose of the film is timeless. This film features great acting, beautiful songs and dance, and great design work and movie shots. Follow the fleet is also funny, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but moments when the act just gets you involved in the storyline. Amazingly, if this movie can put in a certain decade, how it can affect people today. If you want to see something big, check out this.
