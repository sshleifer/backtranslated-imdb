I saw the Son perfect three times. I fail to see how this film is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character, I can not see why every movie with a gay character should prohibit a movie about being gay. I find the movie to be sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your family. I think Theo turns his life around quickly after rehab because he wants and watching his brother die in front of him to make him revive his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be a father to be very moved, Ryan states that he does not want to know about the things he will never see or share with anyone. Is not that awful and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
