I'm sure most people already know the story - miserable Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit to three minds (the past, present and yet zombie zombies) that emphasize part of his life in the hope of saving souls read and change his way. Dickens' classic story in one form or another stood the test of time to become a favorite favorite holiday. While I was growing up watching the version in 1951, Alastair Sims started, and I believe it is definitely the Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors playing ghosts are rather scary and ominous. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well. This version is very well filmed and uses more modern movie styles (for the 1980s) that makes it more palatable for my kids than the 1951 black and white versions. <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I look almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
