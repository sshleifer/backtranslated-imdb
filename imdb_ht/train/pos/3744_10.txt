This is perhaps the best drama of short crime I have ever seen. The act is superb especially Amanda Burton whose character goes from sweet to sweet into sad disturbing and then some ... It does an amazing job to swing Rachels / Carlas feelings and act out the pain of someone who has lost a Children, it's credible that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. The other actors are of course too many who are usually in British / Film TV. The finish, which I will not give away, is fantastic especially because you do not really get one ... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again If you do not touch this you are one cold human being interesting.
