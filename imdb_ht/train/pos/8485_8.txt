Gung Ho tries to express a lot of ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally fun. Keaton balances all three aspects of lead character well. Wantabedde is even better. A warning: George Wendt is extremely poor in his support role. Otherwise, this is quite enjoyable time capsule.
