The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so well-timed after Alan Quartermain (or at least one characteristic of the Alan Quartermain character), that the '85 director made mistakes in plotting the IJ movies for dialogue and history far too deeply. What you got as a finished product was a mess rushed in the name of the Alan Quartermain, into an unmistakable borrower of a Legitimate Imitate Legend IJ (with a touch of cheese Austin Power-Aquire here and there). <br /> It was labeled by many critics being a "great parody," or "unintentionally comedy." Unintentional is the word. This film never intended to be humorous; Witty, yes, but not funny. Unfortunately, it does not matter rather than witty. With this new M4TV mini-series, you get many more stories, character development of your lead, solid painting, and a fine, even, fun mix. This story is short; much longer than its previous, but worthy as such version brings a real storyline and not just action with Candy Eye. While it features both Action and Candy Eye, it also corrects the error made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ altogether and going back to the source material for AQ, making for a fine, well-thought-out plot, and some beautifully completed sub-cellar. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not all action-extravaganza action that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be that. This car is drawn with character driving and it is a pretty pronounced legend of AQ / KSM. Filmed sideways in South Africa, the audience is awarded beautiful (if desolate) visits, ABC culture, and some beautiful wildlife breed smoothly with their performance and scenario here. Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this one, as I've never been one of the subscribers in his vision. In fact, I have neglected most of her work as a director, until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein on talent and less fluid than it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version rates a 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale from the ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
