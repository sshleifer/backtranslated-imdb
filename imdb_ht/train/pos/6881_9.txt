How does a movie that features Curtis Mayfield's song can be bad? It can not! The Groove Tube is a series of skatologically black-out designs that make fun of anything from the 2001 Olympics. Oh, (Koko clown, the lubrific recipe is easy) over the lows (an all too long "dealer"), but even the funny ones. Best of all Ken Shapiro's manicure dancer descends down a Manhattan busy sidewalk. (This is Shapiro, by Nat King Cole just your song, just me). Definitely dated now, but at the time the Groove Tube was irreverent, shiny, cynical and hysterical humorous. Ken Shapiro made this hit miners, then 7 years later did bomb on Christmas day openings, modern problems (though I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. can possibly play drums in a jazz band) staying my an unending burst of positive energy, a movie that 26 years after my first look, still brings me real joy!
