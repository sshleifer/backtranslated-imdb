I expected this to be similar in Schlock as before the movie modest Blaise, which is why I left it plugins for long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a succession of Funny gun fighting with machine / chasing chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets harder like nails, and nothing has been exaggerated or on-streamline. <br /> It is possible that the Contrent budget actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on getting the ever-stupid way for those cats to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. Hell, the biggest weapon battle takes place on screen - and the scene where it hears is all the best for that background noise, which adds to the suspense - who has? Who's Dead? Alexandra Staden might not be like gout-dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti, but some are, and she certainly has all the ounce of class and fire in need to do the character - and shape of her face, her hair and high Her, thin body could be lifted straight from the comic-striped graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise-guy, in which he made the character interesting and enjoyable to look - even likable (and I doubt I would consider taking over brutal, bloodthirsty psychopaths as drinking ami). I can not think of one single in Hollywood in "senior waiters" who could pull the role in that well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise baddies still die, in the end (there is no the spoiler!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would spend their time swooning on like a disgustingly cute dog And exciting can now pragmatically solve for our ordinary joes.
