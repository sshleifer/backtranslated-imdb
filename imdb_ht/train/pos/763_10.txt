This movie changed it all to me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but never saw it professionally done (hey was a 11-year-old kid out of Holland!) When I saw This movie, all this changed. I was actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city, began breakdancing and writing lyrics. That day I still consider this movie to be a personal favorite. Sure, the film and "cinematic" importance might not be relevant. But who cares if the wide shot has filmed it seriously or if you could see a mic which hangs above someone? That's what he does for you personally who counts.
