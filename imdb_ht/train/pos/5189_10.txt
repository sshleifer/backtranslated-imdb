Another Woo's masterpiece! <br /> This is a better wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - greatest director of the century. <br /> <br /> Perhaps hi is no more intellectual than many great directors ... but it is lyrical and spiritual idol of everyone free-minded! <br /> <br /> Its films like the great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a movie biron! Woo is a Mozart in Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> IMHO Violent in Woo film is not a bloodlust director, but an instrument of art. Themes in Woo movies are more humanistic than most of the new films.
