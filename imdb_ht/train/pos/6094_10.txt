These stars are just the iconic heroes / bandits I know that there was a good TV set, so let's compare. Freddy - 7 movie Robocop - 3 movies Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, over 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 seasons, about 22-23 episodes <br /> Freddy - 2 movies (Freddy vs Jason, Freddy vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 Extra Films (Robocop: First Guideline: Cloud Justice, Meltdown, Crack & Burn, Resurrection) <br /> Freddy - 1 Next Robocop Movie - 1 Future Movie < br /> <br /> Who's been having more time screens? Well they both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 next movie. But Freddy wins it thanks to her 2 extra film (one being a fan movie) & 17-18 television episodes. Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmare - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series I would personally choose Robocop ...
