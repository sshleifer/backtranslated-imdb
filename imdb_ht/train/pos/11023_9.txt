The selection of Sylvester Stallone to make the protagonist by Renny Harlin is laudable since Stallone is that sort of hard and crooked people who have earlier rendered the audaciously versatile seller's characters to Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Hard Hard series and Cliffhanger is a far-sought notation. <br /> <br /> The excellent opening ceremony introduces the thrill audience, the suspense and intelligence that goes through the inflammation of the bloodstream and dangerous to meet and prohibit them. The heist with the high transfer altitude of hard cash in case of trial from an airplane to the other is something that is not filmed before. <br /> <br /> The cold cold in the snow capped alp and the deceptive mishap and treacherous among the antagonist forces to make one tremble and excessive. Strength of awesome adventure and murder without mercy to kick the drama until the end. <br /> <br /> The good films have not been done annually and people do not get a look for their eyes to look every now and then. In addition to two linguistically speaking browsings that brighten up some stage scenes, the film can be regarded as one that will not fade to capture calls even after watching many years.
