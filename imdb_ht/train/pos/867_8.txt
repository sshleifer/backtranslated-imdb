As in Amelie, the latest French film seems to be taking a stereotype male-female relationship, centered on a girl to find her true love. In this case, despair leads to a convicted, which leads to its evolution into a mob prototype. Story is smart and surprising in many ways, except that the girl has to support the man. <br /> <br /> For those of you who do not speak French, the subtitles are a little quick, but not reasonable. The soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with the European movie, is great and in five perfect with the movie's variation. Nothing seems to force. Visually, she reminds me of various urban horror movies. There's a Craven Wes in Chicago feels.
