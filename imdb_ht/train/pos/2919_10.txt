I saw the film twice in space a week, both times in a movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place has been loaded both times and people have to turn away. Since the start of the movie and Henry Winkler is getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience has been in disarray with laughs, laughter that has lasted up to their credit. <br /> For those who love this American movie struggle is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you never saw him before. Also look out for a well-known actor whose trademark struggle moves is a top-notch! <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie and it's fun family comedy at its best!
