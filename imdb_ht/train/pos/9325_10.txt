I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thinking I would give it a try. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who finally saw each other after their father passed away. Ryan and Theo first to discuss who is doing this. But later, Theo finds that Ryan, his brother is not only gay but he is dying in a terminal illness. So Ryan and Theo spend time to patching their differences. <br /> This is like an incredible movie. I only saw Colm Feore in Season 7 at 24 but it was the phenomenon of this. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well. <br /> I would recommend this to those who are interested in the genre and lesbian genre. This is one movie you do not want to miss. <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
