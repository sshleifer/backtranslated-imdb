For me this was more a call to wake, and the realization that most we see, hear, read and think about most anything is dependent on what the media we eat. This is a classic example of high level physician turning to try to control the mass of controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a constitution being free to buy, will not be swayed by this media control or any mis-information attempt. Once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the lot will in fact outlast the needs of some of them. It is also intriguing to see that in a country where there is no religious civil war going on, that democracy is not something real hard to implement.
