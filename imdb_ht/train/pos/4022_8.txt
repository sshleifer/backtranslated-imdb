Another detailed work on the subject by Dr. Dwivedi takes us back to Phang-pre-Partisan Time. Dr. Dwivedi has chosen a difficult subject for his first film. He worked on all meticulous details to bring the story into life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. Even though we have not been in the region during this time, along with the costumes look real. Unlike most cinemas held on partition, this one focuses on the gory details of violence to attract audiences, but on its after-effects. Characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee has given an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai has denied his heart out showing the combat of a guilty man-ridden man. The rest of the cast did a good job too.
