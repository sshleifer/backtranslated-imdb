Pinjar by Mr Dwivedi is an awesome movie. It's definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. There is very good performance in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. it is like u never seen before. one true great performance. and he is a fine actor Manoj Bajpai, who has shown Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in Pre-Partition Pakistan. It is from a family of pennsylvania to a small town. He was kidnapped by a Muslim guy as part of a fight for a year that will be over-the-year with the Punjabi family. and then follow a series of twists and turns as urmila wedding row is due in a few days. This film is really a very good movie. The solid storyline and an amazing movie. All the performances like dubey, isha koppikar (u do not believe it can act as well besides dancin jus on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. These people lie with pre-partition pakistan, costume, cinematography, sound, background notes added to the positive points. From the beginning until the end of the r is stuck in u'r chair and the next question? This movie is not worth the amount but deserves to be part of your movie collection. The ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest all these non-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-Gum-and-No-Dil-Pou-Pagal-Hai crowds to watch this amazing flick. Game Rating: 10/10.
