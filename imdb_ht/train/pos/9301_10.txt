I originally saw this very black comedy around 2000 or so on cable TVs. What a surprise and fun! Everyone is covertly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" donation (remember New York's donations supposedly schizophrenic? Art imitate life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are in their most beautiful and not to be toyed with! So prove that beauty and sharpness DO go along! Then there are great "probe" scenes between Barclain and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play in the "junk world." This film is both subtle and bald. For all the shooting, it can be a very quiet movie. And, you have the opportunity to see several actors in the final or near final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. And if you like a movie that has a lot of word play and keep moving without blowing up everything in sight, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert deposits on this movie. It's flat flat. This is a fine, fine film! Maybe just not one for Ebert. I consider it as a 10 because of how it is done and how funny the script can be, while not really being a kind of comedy right in film. I love it well as I bought it on DVD because it just does not get much on cable TV. Now it's all I!
