If you like my war games it is very good. Some of it is cheap but the robots fights are worth seeing. I enjoyed the field of warfare for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen coming near that feeling in what he would like to pilot one of these great mechs. If you like the generic then your favorite games are Mech Warrior three and four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 Steel Battalion supply. The film is worth seeing at least once. There really need to have some more movies on the same theme out there. Less remade and more original work. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
