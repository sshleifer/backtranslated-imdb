Well, I told her all in the summary, I'm simple to worship the movie and throw in ... I would give every actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... i 25 now and i watch it 4 times in different periods and I still think I will not cry and I always do, about 2 or 3 times ...;) Meryl's. was brilliantly brilliant, jeremy irons too .. enjoying brilliant ... i wish the movie got more awards ... i really do not know anybody watching it and did not like it ... too, Clay closure was fantastic. The story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything Clara and esteban loved each other so much, and how Blanca was close to her parents.
