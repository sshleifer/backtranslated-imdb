Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the world proud game. The various movements and wrists have to be learned as crap is a skill in and in itself. <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I fully expect the 'good girl' to cry on her tomb, instead of her buddy. Especially with his remarks about 'going to the funeral of his best friend', when he first met Matt. Then, of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who has dropped acid batter in Mr. Allen's face, dazzling him (interesting role by Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood endings have arrived, but the writing is so excellent, the act so carefully compels that you're blissfully unaware. <br /> And the music is out of this world. Taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passion' was first being triggered by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a little racist rifle its ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called, beautiful, 'Biloxi' and a flag of Confederation to retreat the racist remarks. I'll watch it again, just hear the music. Good thing I have the FACTOTUM sound track, so I can listen to that in the car. See both together, and you'll see how Matt was mature .... Play low room characters in both. NO to possess a bar at Paramount HOtel in NYC, it probably has great opportunities to do his / her study. Great actor, just coming to his own. It shows the nuance pipes performance ... the good and the bad of his character. 'His boy in the field' is a great study, made especially intense because of his bassett-hound eyes. He does love, convince as well. Since she was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teenager-ager, I wonder how she ... made love to an actress as she grew up with. Add condemnation, I'll say that.
