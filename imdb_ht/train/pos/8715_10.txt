This movie is by far the cutest I've seen in a long time! Beautiful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were nice!) Made this one a winner of my book, and also in the books of those I've seen it with. I still want to see her again, but no time. Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but not good.
