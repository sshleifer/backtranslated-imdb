Why did not this pick up a bag full of Oscars? It is an amazing interpretation of a frequently-filmed piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in the wide screen ... The pan & scanning really kills wonderful movies in this movie and sets). Each frame is a painting. Astounding. The game is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is clear in the opening titles. No Zefferelli here, just the great story of the movie's only way, but rarely done. Jacobi is mostly perfect as the Hamlet's uncle: he does not play it like a evil villain-curling Villian, but a good politician, allowing us to see why only amusing suspect bad game. Branagh also nicely nails in the line between the foal / real hamlet and the revenge burn inside it. And so many come out quite well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, unobtrusive if you're sucked into Branagh's vision of the way I was. A fascinating piece.
