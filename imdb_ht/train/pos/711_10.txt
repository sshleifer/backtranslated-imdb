Rock 'n' Roll High School "will probably be down to history as the movie The Final Rebel. Participate a great high school student using the Ramones music as inspiration against the despotic principal (Mari Woronov, called "Food Raoul" fame), the whole movie is a thousand minutes. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you'll be. Nursing Lowering? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also in "Food Raoul" *)? Check. Blast mouse? Checkmate. <br /> Anyway, this is sort of thing that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know the Ramones music, it's fun. With Roger Corman executive product and Joe Dante co-directed, how could we expect anything less? Too strong that director Allan Arkush later degenerated at ticket prices such as "Caddyshack II". <br /> Also starring PJ Sol, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who appeared at each one of Joe Dante's movies, and many of Roger Corman's), Don Steele, and of course the Ramones . A real treat. <br /> It seems like Bartel and Woronov still co-starred. They also co-starred Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the flicker "Slash Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they dared their role in "Food Raoul".
