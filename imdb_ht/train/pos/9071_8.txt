People with weak constitution will have some difficulty since the "worms" are realistic enough to cause churning in more than a few of the audience. Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight, Panitz was able to get some serious weather on the next few years. <br /> <br /> Miss Eisenberg has developed from a beautiful face of a strong young actress and charm and wonderful comic delivery. <br /> The story makes a spectacular job in dealing with intimidation, friendship, and justice. It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open manner with Frank while reminding some "gross" scenes in the movie.
