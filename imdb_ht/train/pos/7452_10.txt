I'm a big fan of a theater story faerie and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic, and a classic. I recommend that for all ages. It's great for little kids because it's fine, Cinderella and great for adults and teens because it's funny and not over the head. I looked at her when I was little and I still watch her now. It has great lines that my family and I quote all the time. The act is great and never gets old. If you love fairy tale and romance you will love this. I watched a lot of Cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie with all the show of faerie story theater. They are all appealing to all ages and are all unique and very fun.
