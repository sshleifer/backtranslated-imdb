An original original drama, with some fine fighting scenes. Tobey Maguire provides an excellent performance, and gets some nice good back-up. The script is literally and beautifully original, and it is the movie to keep free thanks to heroes. That said, it slips a bit, and the last coil is too much like a mini-series TV. Still, Frederick Elmes's camerawork holds one interested in the dull bits (and now you see a shot that reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Worth to see.
