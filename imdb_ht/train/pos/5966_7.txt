Actually, I never bought the metal was satanic and other things, but this type of movie played on this idea. Though certainly not a movie taken seriously or really really high, it serves its purpose in that it is fun while playing. The story has a metal band that consumes the death of the hotels, one of the fans has a dream of this effect, saying the band begins to go on a plant killed from the grave. So yes, a bit of "Elm Street Nightmare" draw will be here. Freddy's award never melts a girl in a car before. There was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played out as it had a lot of type taken over a city of kids and made them crazy. This one simply has fans of one of the band types in helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him. Nothing is nicely in it as I do not remember all that many gory kill. Quite frankly, the scene I remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some animal incarnations in the group. There is nothing great, but a nice time filler.
