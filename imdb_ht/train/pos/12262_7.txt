Some thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published a book length interview with the Belgian comic book artist Georges Remi (best known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This movie captures with Sadoul today as he recalls the interview, while we listened to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and saw some old and foot photos of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and we now know what was being faced with his separation from his wife, after having a deal with one of his collaborators (which years later would become his second wife). Another interesting feature of the film is that the book Tintin's change from the early and imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the Southeast) is just a few years later (Blue Lotus) in the just anti-imperialist book. On the whole, I came from this movie a few more about Herge and saw it as a bit more incredible than when I came to the theater.
