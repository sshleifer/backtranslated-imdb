My personal sensation is that you can not divulse this movie from its political / historical background as much (American) reviews tend to be. This is not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the men torn between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between "Joe Tovarish" and the guys. There are disappointments in certain situations that are lost on a hearing that never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is under-rated and it's too bad we've lost the director. Movies like this make life feel more important. It is not just "another Eastern European coming in the movie" ... it is a sensitive portrait of adolescents walking a fine line that would eventually lead them to real liberty.
