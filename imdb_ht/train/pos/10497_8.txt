I just thought it was excellent and I always did. I am grateful we can always see the different things that Hollywood have about to do with us. Grace's economy is smart and enjoyable - those who feel left to leave in this marijuana thing better to see America's bride's sting in film. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows a funny movie should not be stupid. I laughed at my ass while most of her, but also reflected on what the lead character was supposed to pay her husband's debt. <br /> In a nutshell - a witty storyline with typical English humor and good acting and directing. You could not ask for more. <br /> 7/10.
