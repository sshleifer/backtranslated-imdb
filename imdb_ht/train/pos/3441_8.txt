This film is extremely realistic and I feel a great crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think they could understand what goes on a victim's head is arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson has done a fantastic job in his role in Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This appears to be rape in a different, more realistic way than any other movie I have ever seen on the subject. The end has been dragging temporarily, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker being sent to prison for crimes are around 1%. It is good to see a film that sticks closer to reality than most would dare.
