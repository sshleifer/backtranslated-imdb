Really touching stories in a recruiting camp in America, where young men are preparing for the Vietnam war. The human study still appealed to me when it came to cinema wars, because it translated perspective, subjective warfare, opposing war actions by actions, and technical data to analyze the prejudice of the human factor. The movie managed to put a new turn on an already ancient topic, and managed to distance itself from normal war cinema, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the point-point to traditional standards them. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked into by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fights for something he does not believe in, spends his energy, in seeking ways to avoid being sent abroad, both for himself and his comrades and ironically end up getting their own right just to finally go to war. Perfect irony. The act is really exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel the transformation of the movie. Also, the film will give food to those who are happy with the action of the usual shotgun or war-game enthusiasts, hoping to raise some spirits in a generation that lets the fear of being shot.
