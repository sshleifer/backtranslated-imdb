The true story of a bunch of djenki steals a businessman is not so honest in drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some might say this is America's tragic story of the eighties too high in peace and free love for free crashed in drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people who have no purpose in life located around getting high and decides to rob a wicked man. Which second part of the master plan? Once they have things ... they will sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and there are no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of popular hero from these characters, and part stage with a montage of looting, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more straightforward approach forward. As it is, this is just a sad story of small drug dealers getting killed by large drug dealers. The biggest story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. It is the center of this story anyway. This movie should be all about it, his life. It was one of Wonderland, and the wonders of fading away. Although not official, Swag Boogie is a better version of Holmes's life. It's not entirely reality, but it's far more enjoyable.
