Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and looked at him several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> I loved it when I first saw it and I like it still. <br /> Unfortunately, it seems he never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow-up. I must assume QT always controls the rights, but after killing Bill if he makes a movie that is true and funny and books as my name is modest, and another hard lead female, anyone who is not familiar with the character will See this as a let-down. Peter O'Donnell writes his story to focus more on psychological suspicion rather than thrilling action. <br /> The tug of additions between Modesty and Miklos is very true of the source material and it is tense, suspense and fascinating of anyone who does not have to gore and blast. Alexandra did a great job of playing how O'Donnell's character would take control of the situation. <br /> I find this particularly ahead of the curve after the severely needed restarts of Batman and James Bond. After 2 widespread efforts, although not nearly as well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the modest character, and it is really sad that probably no more movie about it will do.
