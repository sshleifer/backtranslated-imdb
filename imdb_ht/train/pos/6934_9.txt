Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I love about it. It's not every day your west - it uses a rifle, which passes hands out of various characters - as a mechanism for telling the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an American masterpiece, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gall having to deal with the realities of her husband and wild west. It is important to note that these types are politically incorrect - to kill a lot of Indians in this movie without remorse. By today's standards, it's still very violent. But it's a great story and worth watching. Enjoy!
