As Peckinpah did with DOGS, and Kubrick with an ORANGE CLOCKWORK, director John Boorman delivered an effective film on the violent man of DELIVERANCE, arguing a definite horror movie in the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox show four businessmen Atlanta who decided to take a boat trip down the Cahulawassee River to northern Georgia before damming up to what Reynolds called "one big, dead lake." /> <br /> But the popular local hill takes a great look to the vision of the "boys in the city" carousing in the woods. And next day, continue on down the river, Beatty and Voight were acclaimed and sexually attacked (the infamous film "SQUEAL!" Sequence) by two vicious mountains (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward) . So, what started out as nothing more than a bark in the Appalachians now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists came to the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think as barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey fits the scenario out of its own best-selling book, and the result is a frequently prolonged and disturbing shocking. Often known for its "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" sequence, DELIVERANCE is also a moment of beat beat, and the four superb princes in their role, and McKinney and Coward make for two of the most feared bandits ever. A must-see movie for those who want to take a chance.
