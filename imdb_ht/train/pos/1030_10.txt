I name this with BABYLON 5 as the best Sci-Fi TV series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, they showed nice, but there was no general theme or scheme that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you might usually watch the shows totally out of sequence that have no difficulty understanding what happened. This was the less case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battle that took all the final seasons) and the other TREK shows, as there was more to a larger unified story. This consciousness seems to have been developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has seen this in a greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long, slowly gay woman. Sure, there were a few "intestines" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually very funny. <br /> And talking to comics, I loved that SG-1 kept the light mood from time to time and not so much serious. In that way, I actually loved it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great and sarcastic character with the love of Homer Simpson - it's really too bad he's slowly faded in the series of epic later. <br /> <br /> For really appreciating SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how to fully work in plots. This cooperation gives the outstanding show of power. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.
