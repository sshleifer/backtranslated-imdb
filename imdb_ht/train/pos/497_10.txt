Call me adolescent but I really think this is a great set. If you have not had a chance to experience a few episodes in the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely look this one. Perhaps more compelling than those of Voyager's keeper, launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, the adventures of Archer are completely different, but weirdly familiar ... The music is also catchy. No real sci-fi fans can go without seeing at least a Star Trek Episode - and these installments make the refreshing wait.
