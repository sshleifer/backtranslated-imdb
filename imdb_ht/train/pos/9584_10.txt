Yeah this movie is top. Cant recommends reading more. Gay or narrow it a great doco for anyone who likes film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A movie made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only get this movie on VHS it's still very worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I got to see a part of this year doco about ten years ago and did not understand what I was looking at. Interviews are very revealing about the ego of performers such as heavy-weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto. The movie was apparently a first clock so a success. Cool. Track it down.
