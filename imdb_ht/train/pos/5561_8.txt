Ok, unknowingly, this movie is only going to appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. That being said, if you are one of those people aformentioned, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for top shops to sell a copy of it to anyone who buys their first bong. What Holy Grail Monty Python is geeks and nerds, so this movie is potheads. I saw this first movie 10 years ago or so, and I always crack up every time I watch it. The jokes are perfectly lampoon form of pothead, far better than days knockoffs like half-cooked attempts. <br /> <br /> No one draw, so to speak; The movie is more of a collection of various skits; as the protagonists loaded around Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of speed, and it does not drag at all. Many people cite up smoke as C & C's best work, but I should say that Next movie is superior. So, if you're in the mood for an hour and half of street laughter, light up, tune in, and let yourself float away =) <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
