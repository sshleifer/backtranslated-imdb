I have been young ever known to many, but in the past few years I've seen a lot of colors in the Red Novelty Tee and I thought they were cool, but I did not want to buy a shirt I know anything about. So, a Saturday he came on lead and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the movie was going on before I looked it but it was great once I found out. In the movie prince was not known as chief but as the "kid". All the performances where my great, but my favorite were Color Red Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs were tied to what's going on out of the movie when her mother and dad were still fighting the song when pigeons called described what she felt. I also like how smart masterpiece was and how it flirting with Apallonia. I love when Prince and Appallonia first met at the club and he stood behind her and then once he turned around he had disappeared! big movie and now i cant even get one of these tee shirts :(
