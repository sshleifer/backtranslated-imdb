I run across this movie on the TV and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays a fellow fellow who fell for a very hot and beautiful Goldie Hawn (who would not?). The way Goldie's character holds itself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today. This film gave me a different angle in human relationships and also I found it very funny. Peter Sellers role was a hard sold, but I think he pulled it well.
