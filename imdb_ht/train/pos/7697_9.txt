This is another big movie I've had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). Back in late 80's I was a new relative to the genre and only really new on the great three JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my earnings to see this in a "Triple Classics bill" in the old Scala. I do not have to worry, I left this movie. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movie and have not seen this movie, do it now!
