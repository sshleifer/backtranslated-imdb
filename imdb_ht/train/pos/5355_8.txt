Running Man Vitaally modern-day American media complex, and hit its target dead-center. It can be an easy target, but pull it off any less. RM facilitates pro-liter (featuring some Pro Writers as the Hunters), television networks, Nielsen's ratings, the U.S. government (suggests that it's entertainment-anyway), crime and punishment, and a half-dozen other thing on the road. It is a far cry from the original Stephen King novel, and Arnold is not the Richards of the novel either. But who cares? It's basically an Arnie flick, with all the well-choreographed and one-piece shares such an undertaking require.
