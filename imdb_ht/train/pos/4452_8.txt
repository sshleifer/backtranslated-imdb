Do not be swayed by the naysayers. This is a wonderful spooky movie. This was a thesis project for the writer / director, JT Petty. He did a great job to make me on the corner in my place. I never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror-movie visitor, this is Nirvana! The film concerns an elderly man who lives in an isolated recording cabin in the woods. One day, while seeking his cats in the woods, he witnessed the murder of a child, or did he? He agonizes about this the rest of the movie. What is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes. I found this to be intriguing. The writer managed to get hold of your senses and give them a implantable tug. Give this movie a go, you will not be disappointed.
