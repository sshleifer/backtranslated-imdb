Some critics found this movie weak, but for me there was enough humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the character slowly positive and stoically of the daughter is the center still in the movie, often counterbalancing the happy aspects of the environment and plotline. The movie is full of original ideas and characters, and the final result is not predictable: I felt it could go either way. <br /> By the way, many reviews I've read about the efficient use of black and white, but the print I've seen, on SBS TV network here in Australia, was in full color. <br /> <br />
