This vibrant western turns the story of the famous gulf of the early west who was coveted by one and all. James Stewart is the cowboy who win Winchester's precious in a shootout, only to lose it in a flight. Stewart's story of stealth details of the rifle and a certain man in the movie. The shotgun changes over time, as if the owner would like to lose it in violence. The photograph has many actions and suspicions as Stewart is closing in on his career. A great cast to support Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of his role is rather dark. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teen heartthrobs in later years, have a good but good role.
