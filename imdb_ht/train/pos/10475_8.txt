A friend of mine recommends this movie, citing vocal similarity with my influence and profiles of Howl, the main character of the movie. I guess at a limit I can see that and maybe a little bit more, I'm not sure if you're not this flattering painter. This is a very unique work, the only movie that this might have more than a glancing similarity would be True Romance, not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue (Whale Music is just for much more, well, relax.) But instead that they both represent modern love stories. In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian music about music and musicians (for example I highly recommend Hard Core Logo) and this particular movie. It has an innocent charm, profiles are not always the most strict guy, but there's something about it that draws a sterling sort of sympathy.
