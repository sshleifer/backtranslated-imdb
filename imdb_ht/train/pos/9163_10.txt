When my daughter is currently in college was in preschool, this minister appeared on A & E from 8-9 every morning. My neighbors and I made a park that we would not miss a minute at Jane Eyre and our kids were late for kindergarten every morning for the entire week. Good Choice. <br /> I would forget how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very nice, but always perfect like Rochester. The dark, clad face, the temperate temperament tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I could not sit in an adaptation that begins Wimpy William Hurt or Cursed Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in romance. <br /> I would like to know what comes to Zelah Clarke. She is dying as Jane, quiet, formal, she says merchant with a look. The brilliance of her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirit nature that helped Jane to survive the bad treatment she endured in teens. Critical of his performance as "wooden" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English home should keep just such an attitude, but he speaks passionately when overcome with emotions. Unlike Janes' other screens, it appears that enough Jane has always been wonderful enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester attractions. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue is a great part of why the book supports the script to keep many of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla flames, she refuses to be drenched by darkness, Rochester sweater. Two driving to play in each other very well. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever.
