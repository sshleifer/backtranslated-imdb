At the Academy's Academy Awards on March 27, 1957, Dorothy Malone won the best Oscar comedy support to bet, over-top-painted in a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN on the WIND. Potboiler in 1956, adapted to Robert Wilder's novel, was a genuine three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania.

A very erudite man, Circus has made a name for himself in the 1950s as Universal Studios' Director of Soapful, Fascinating and Production of Ross Hunter's MAGNIFICATION OBSERVATION, all that makes the sky enabled and imitation of life. Independent producers Albert Zugsmith offers Circus the opportunity to work out the limited constraints of the various universal entertainment and create a more adult, sensational product, hence the hot and follow-up WIND, the 1957 gears fitted, both released under the banner International international. It's anyone who guess why Circus did not pursue loftier themes, but apparently directed these exaggerated play pieces to make more appeal to his artistic tenderness. WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered the Circus soap era; Indeed, it is so abundant and vulnerable to humanity and neurosis as depicted among the many riches that it is as compelling to look like any real life squabble domestic among wealthy and famous, perhaps more so. Robert Stack (not an actor typically known for over-emulation) almost matches Malone's intensity and his offering to the weak brother-will be Kyle Hadley, a shadow only to his patriarchal father. When she finds that she is able to impregnate her new bride (a beautiful leonine Lauren Bacall), Hadley goes to the bottom of the valley, raises an already serious drink problem with a "secret" gun fiction that threatens to make her a human human bomb. Both brothers and sisters, as swallowed and unlikeable as they are, are presented as past victims, giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous (and far more interesting than the 'good' side of the family, especially Bacall and Hudson Rock, the beautiful Hadley's younger adult and business associate, a son of reimbursement of the old man and unattainable Malone objects of desire.) Despite all the domestic addictional dependencies on display, it's not so much history which is memorable here as the way it is filmed.With a real panache for piktorial and correction composition, Circus director draws his audience in this picture with cinematography that most intensify imaginable imaginable: every single shot of this movie is an eye-catching campaign of saturated colors, from the sight of a tank like pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous castle door to the garish decor in a luxury luxury hotel, a spectacle of almost blinding jewelery in their diversity. and dramatic scenes featuring used to circled the circled angles of camera angles, lighting lighting and cross-cutting correction, showing the greatest effect of the stage where a rebellious, dancing Malone danced uninhibitedly in his upper room in the loud blaring of a player records while enters it's dad practicing up in the stairs; The scene is so fixed that you swear you are experiencing a great ODIPAL drama unfold. What you're really watching is garbage in a kind of entertaining fun, gussied up in Liquid Technicolor and polished perfection by a visual engineering.
