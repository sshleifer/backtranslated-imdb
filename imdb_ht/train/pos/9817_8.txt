I remember this film. Quite intense for a 11 year old. Good correction, I felt terrible for Bernard Bernard. I would watch it again if it was embedded, but the signal will pass Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm just happy I did not live in this neighborhood. Oh these 70's. What a decade. If it is rejected I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So, what are they waiting for? An excellent film for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think he was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The shotgun and St. Bernard were the best and obviously the most haunted images from the film ... and then left the corpse on the basket. Child rotten.
