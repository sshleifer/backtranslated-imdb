Mr. Blandings Build Dream House It's Best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie ever made! If you like to bring baby, the Philadelpia story, the thin person, I was a Male Man Bride or It is a beautiful life - movies that are made with understanding, taste and with the occasional tongue firmly panted in a blow, check this one out. Post WWII life is simply and idly described. <br /> <br /> Grant is in the sheer top of her shape playing the mouse town ventured into the life of a land snake. Loy is adorable as her pre-wife now. Throw in characters supported compared to you can not take it with you and it's got a bit earlier by Tarzan Barker Lex. Art Directions and Editions are the top style. The movie never stoops on the low-rent, pa-to-number venetian slapstick in the later Pit's adaptation of money.
