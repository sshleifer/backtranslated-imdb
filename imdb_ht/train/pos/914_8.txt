Vivah is by no means a classic. However in the days of hardcore action, path-breaking special effects and complex plots (none of which Bollywood has mastered yet), quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story as we all know is a trip from the first couple of wedding meetings to eventually following some coy and time tests. There is nothing more, nothing less. The music is not well in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it's not your jar either. Two songs stand for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Make Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi was hummable. Shahid does sincerely & shows much potential. It's good to see her play something else but the "cool dude" she normally does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a little girl city-girl in perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are terrific support and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The premise of the film is the slow pace that could test the patience of a lot of young viewers. But all in all a good, neat, decent family movie.
