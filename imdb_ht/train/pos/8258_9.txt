At a risk of sounding a little sacrilegious, on my first look I'm kind of inclined to put that right up on a par with the 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realize this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree to the last statement can be a preliminary caliber of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you. In a comedy way to pick up where 'Shaun' leaves, except we 're back to the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotyped mid-American small town. The zombie wars on them and zombies themselves will become more adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the beginning, is largely thanks to the scientific progress made by the good people of Zomcom - a nice game about romantic comedy maybe? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie lies in its dead-boiler depot in a respectable neighborhood maintaining basic values ​​while doing a place for zombies and the special dangers posed. The charm and balance with which it does is close enough to perfect. Themes that you might expect from a most mainstream firefighters come in - the veneer of good living living, keeping up appearances, repressing emotions, modeling parents' values, social decorations and combat to those who are marginalized. a story told with cheerful joy and wide appeal that leads to life clearly by the all-round movie cast cast. It's one of those who works where it really shows that everyone involved has got a kick from taking part. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly learns his script must have been like ... <br /> So, in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humor of this movie unless your father tried to feed you.
