'One-Round' Jack Sander calls this because he is a carnival boxer who fights anyone at the hearing. If they can spend one round, they have a prize - a popular way to draw customers to travel shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, though his head quickly turns when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his luck with Jack. What no one in the battle knows is that Bob is the champ, so he could beat Jack - even if he took him some job. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his boss partner and gives up the carnival race. And Jack improved so much that he, too, became a legitimate boxer. Slowly, she works her way up the rankings until she's almost ready to take on the champ. In the meantime, the Champ and Mabel start running around Jack's back - though not now Mabel has been married to Jack. So, when the final battle came between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is it good enough? Will they be able to raise justifiable rage against Bob's help or to prevent his performance? This music was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems unusual for a known director for mystery-suspension films, back in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre that he led or writing (he did both for this movie). In fact, in many ways this movie is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar scheme came in one of his next silence, the MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the wrong husband) . So while this looks a lot like a standard boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great - same and final director than its formula. <br /> <br /> Overall, while somewhat predictable and having Ian Hunter play a boxing champion looks amazing, the movie works well. While far from a perfect silence, it's well worth seeing and pack a nice punch.
