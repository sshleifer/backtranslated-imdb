All Dogs Going to Heaven are the most Cutest Animated Movie films were dogs in 1989. Previous Next Bluth Film Land Before The Time (1988) Became A Success. Dogs are so cute as little mouse. Well, I just want to embrace them when they're nice. Where did I go? Oh, yes. Its beautiful animation, the characters are great when they are performing voices and singing them beautifully and touching. It was opened in November 17 1989 the same as the Little Mermaid produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. The part where Charlie Got was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Capacity is so mean because he wants to kill Charlie. Shame on him! Love songs survived by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson were so beautiful. All the dogs going to the sky are the best animated movie ever.
