A 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy who lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inability compared to her older sister. That is the simple quote of this beautiful, poetic coming up of the movie by Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for summer 's lead in '42 in 1971 and killing a Mockingbird in 1962, two of the great at coming to genre age. Here she directs newcomers to the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her first film, as the 14 year old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as Court, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good at her first movie, showing all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl feels in experiencing genuine love and hurting youth, never hit a fake score. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately portrays every thought or feelings of adolescence in regard to love and sincere heartfelt, never cross over to maudlin even once. Kudos in the autobiographical scenario of Jenny Wingfield; This is one of the many films about love of young people who are honest and consistent in tones without being emotionally unfair or sensationalist. The music is pretty simple, accentuating the tone and mood from the stage scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinema is not renowned horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his 70s then shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with deadly accuracy for 1957, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, learn, and truth the face of this sweet-natured movie that packs an emotional box. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best films in 1991. **** at 4 stars.
