Peter Sollett created an endearing portrait of real people living in Lower East Side poverty in New York, or Loisaida, as it is known to the locals. Sollett's caretaker is at the right place as he examined this dysfunctional family, that is typical of the different 'inner cities' of the country. Mr. Sollett emphasizes positive in his presentation. These are basically good kids, the kids left their parents and their grandmother was taken under her wings. <br /> Instead of presenting his character as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side of all. These children are not in drugs, or are stolen because they are poor. This story was made by Hollywood we would see a parade of stereotypes, instead of kids struggling, but deep down inside them, they do not beat. Victor Rukuk, as Victor Vargas, was a revelation. It is a natural one. So is July Marte. Her character shows us a nonsense girl who will not deceive or drive to do anything she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. He interpreted his frustration by not being able to drag his seed into the things he believed in and who are so important to him. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was an excellent picture of Peter Sollett.
