Most people, especially young people, can not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss, when it's actually a story about being alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> Johnson's Horse Horse reflects the total opposite of Sandler's character Financing. Where Johnson felt trapped in his blessing, Fineman tried to forget his life from the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful addict of the cast and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle was the comic role and was a great supporter for Sandler. <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. A beautiful movie. If you've ever lost and felt alone, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
