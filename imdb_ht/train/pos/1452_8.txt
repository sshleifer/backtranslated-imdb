Being a New Yorker transplant, I can be more critical than most in City Hall. But I must say that before even in the story I was captivated by the shooting site and the political atmosphere in New York City that Director Harold Becker created. <br /> <br /> For example there is a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where Frank Anselmo's political broker likes to eat. There was or was a Woerner Restaurant in Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political men in the borough even though they had a couple of other hangouts. There is no surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes political history and organizes crime. He knows the atmosphere quite well and is sure to know how these two worlds cross as they do in this movie. <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an official meeting with a clan of Francois Francois boss and things popping up with three men wind up dead, including an innocent 6-year-old boy with father was walking in the school. The story mushrooms and the end it reaches inside the City Hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a Louisianan transplanted, a state with a tradition of gendering corruption itself. She is outsider here and in trying to control damage, Cusack finds out more than she negotiations, Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn boss Frank Anselmo and for those of us not from New York, her character is based on the President at the end of the municipality of Queens Donald Manes who also brought down scandal. It's a great quality of Brooklyn politicians I knew on days of friends and organized crime and favors made for them, making Aiello. City Hall was the performance I left on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most disgruntled and under-appreciated talent ever on the screen. No one looks at anyone else whenever he's over. <br /> <br /> The best time of Al Pacino is when the funeral of the killing child dies and takes on the procedures and turns it into a political triumph for himself. It's a complex part, it's a decent enough man, but one caught up in the corruption it takes to ride in a place like New York. <br /> For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.
