I decided not to believe what most popular movie critics say. Even if this movie did not get the best comment, this movie did my day. She thought me. What a false world this is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your favorite people are deceiving you? He said that no matter how many times you eat milk in a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. As some people are like they are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can and how everyone is finally just thinking about himself and working for himself. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently in the hands of a gangster. The survival fee decided to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about worthlessness in this world. There is nothing that is real and no loyal to anyone. Amitabh has given performance to his life. The Haitian Haitian actor gave a good performance. Actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. His role was small but he showed his roles for diligence that one was moved by his performance. Chawla had a really great face expression, but her role was very limited and she was not given a chance to express herself. A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films still give some messages to the audience. His film is like the novel of Nanak Singh (a novelist panjabi of novel always had a purpose and targeted a socially wrong) because of a real message for the audience. They are fun as well as giving lessons.
