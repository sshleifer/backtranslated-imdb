First of all I need to say that I'm Portuguese and it's not usual to spend my time watching Portuguese movies, probably one year or even by one ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is the almost generalized idea of ​​the Portuguese people that the national pictures are terrible, really close to the worst ever to do! However, in the last decade, it began to surprise me when we get back the comic of the 40s when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best worlds of time, and movies like "Pulsação zero "or" Nula Notes ", both director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common. <br /> This one is also good, not of the same type because it is not a true comedy; In fact it's officially a drama, a woman's drama has some unexpected funny parts, the cause of funny characters or hilarious things that happen to them, such as the hypothetical journey of the Caribbean just to get laid. <br /> <br /> The plot is working and can surprise us a few times; The actors are good, the regular positions as the score; but the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema, which seems to start in the ashes as the Phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese film, surely you can take the best option, but still one must measure.
