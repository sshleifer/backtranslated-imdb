I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko went halfway through the film from the resonance of his courage and wisdom not to forget. I did not finally eventually to South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience of a dance recital in Natal Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika songs, my hair stood on it. There is much to learn from this story for all people.
