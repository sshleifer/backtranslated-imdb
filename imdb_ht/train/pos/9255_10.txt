If you want a fun film and loads of subtle humor, then you'll enjoy this flick of films. <br /> I do not understand why anyone would not like this one. Take it for what it is: a car for Dennis Hopper mess with yourself and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and keeps her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and it shows a talent for subtle humor. Too bad it did not have much opportunity to expand. Tom Berenger has adapted his role in "real navy" perfectly to William McNamara doing a solid job as a hustler. Throw in a walk-on by Hopper in the middle of the chase for the "Cherry on this Sundae" and you've got a movie that has caught my attention and keeps me laughing. I bought this one as soon as it was available. <br /> Brain-Candy.
