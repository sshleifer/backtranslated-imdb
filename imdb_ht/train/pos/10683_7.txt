This is a better than silent film average and it's still well worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you're not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other movies before watching this one. That's because the scheme just seems very old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. But despite that, it's still a good movie and keeping my interest. <br /> A lovely lady unfortunately tuned to the wrong man and ran to marry her. The movie begins five years later after it came to realize that it is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to do better in her and does not dwell on how good life was before this jerk went into her life. However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. It becomes a personal sewing for a lady whose husband is trying to balance a business contract. Unfortunately, the lady who tried to hang up a potential client and for a dinner party can not do it and the tenderness is paid nice to be the date of the man. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans beautifully and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now - provided that she is actually married to the new fella wants to marry her? Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. I did not like how to handle the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and cleverly. However, once it came out of the way, I admire how the movie also did not give up a final-by-final-and left the movie with a few loose finishes. , a very good movie is worth seeing, but certainly not great.
