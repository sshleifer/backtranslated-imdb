One of the largest television drama pieces in the last decade. During the five hours, perceptions and empathy are constantly challenged as it explores many aspects of modern British society today. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. The first comes across as a heavy copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proves to be smart and caring, as he works with him to uncover the truth. I never saw Surrane Jones before. I believe it comes from the world of soap TV. His performance was magnificent, as he kept his moods and compressions also trying to balance their demands in the case and the stress of caring for his mother. I could go and talk about every member of the cast that contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbed script that constantly challenges your thoughts on any of the characters. It is such a program to restore one's faith in TV drama, also at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly fulfilling the bursts.
