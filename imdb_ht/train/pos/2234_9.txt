While 'special effects' and technical attributes of this film may in fact be ridiculous to some, I have never been able to delete the following image of this film engraved on my young and impressionable ideas when I first saw it at around 8 years aged. The story of surviving this girl and the trials she endured stayed with me all the years, and I thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl did it out of situation far behind anything I saw. <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was only a kid when I first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating in this movie. Whenever this film was revealed on television in the 70s and 80s, I'd made riveted on the TV, drinking in every scene with an interest I could not explain. I suppose it will be watching this for the first time as an adult (with a jaded look in the world) it may not be as enjoyable in some. I actually came from the way I found a copy so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories, they are part of Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, then I believe you could enjoy this movie as long as I enjoyed it for the past 30 years .
