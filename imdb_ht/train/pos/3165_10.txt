This was one of the most funniest sitcom and greatest hit national television. It's painful that the show does not include amongst the great sitcom where it really belongs. The actors did a superb job and one-six seasons were shown at its peak point. Although Seven Seven was not as great when compared to previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kick off. Without justifying Topher or Ashton Kutcher the show simply falls apart. Not too hard, other actors were not big if any of the two main characters left as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great) left show it would have the same impact. With the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either because he was not well received by fans to show. I believe that the show ended a year ago it would certainly go down to history as one of the great sitcoms. Season 8 was a little dull, but the final was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope I wake up one day to get out the show is back like the 80's show and the same throw because I'm going to miss the hell out of it.
