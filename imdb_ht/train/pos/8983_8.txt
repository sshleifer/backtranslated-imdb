Shot in cars from the billboard, someone playing another last song, someone else did not react, according to the voice-on. I just wonder how this happened. There have been too many scenes in this film that I am wondering about how a camera came in. If the scenes were shot where the Warhols were down on a BJM post-party is then what was the incredible blast of the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it was make me comfortable, if that was the goal? Along the way to this movie I kept wondering how the foot came on. Taken in face value, a beautiful portrait of (tortured) engineering we all believe ourselves to be.
