This film may seem that today, but remember that he did in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Dippie Weatherman's Hippie and humorous satire humor. This movie is the granddaddy of them all. Enjoy it for its historic significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
