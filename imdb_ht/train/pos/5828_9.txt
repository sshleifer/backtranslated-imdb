Micro-phonies are a classic Stooge short. The guys are repairers who are inept working on a radio station, and while some are doing around an emission booth, the perfect curly mimicking of a "Voices of Spring" is a mistake for the real thing, leading to a radio deal with a party music party. The mock pronunciation of the quintet from "Lucia de L'Amamore" is especially fun. No doubt this is the look of Stooge fans. Although the evidence of health fail Curly's visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing, and it is probably the latest glimpse of the old curly. Some fans think that "a bird in the hand" is the last great Curly short, but its coarse voice and slow motion are just too hard to look.
