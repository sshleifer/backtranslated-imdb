I love ghost stories in general, but I particularly like chilly, atmospheric and elegant creepy British period-style ghost story. This one is eligible for all counties. A lawyer lawyer ("jurist" in Britspeak) sent to a small village near the sea to resolve an old woman, the deceased. It's in the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Brits went to the sea on vacation for their "health." Well, guess what, there is nothing "healthy" on the village of Crythin Gifford, the creepy site of hulking the elderly woman, the Victorian estate brooding, located on the whips of a fog-swathed single tide. When the lawyer saves the life of a girl (none of the locals will help die in danger - you get why later on in the movie), inadvertently incurs the anger of a malicious spirit, the woman in black. He has no movie, watcher wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees it a few times, but you feel its malware presence in each frame. As the camera creeps up to the lawyer while reading in papers, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. When the lawyer goes out of the generator leaks turn on the electricity for the old climbing house, the snake cameras in it and you think it will pop up there, too. Waiting for the woman to show up nails is nail-bitingly suspended. We have seen many elements in this previous story (the closed room that no one enters, the fog, the naughty outsider that ignores the locals' warning) but the director somehow managed to combine them all into a completely new ghost -all and compelling story. Watch it with a friend so you can have a warm person to grab on while waiting for the woman to black. . .
