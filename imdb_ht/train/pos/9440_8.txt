"Deliverance" is one of the best movie films from this wonderful 1970's decade from where many other exploitation films have come. A group of friends lay out on a boat trip down a river in the south and become victimized by a bunch of sick people who are very beautiful trying to ruin their lives. It is sad. We are treated to anal rape, greedy beatings, bows and arrows killings, shooting, broken bones, etc. ... A lot like "Texas Massacre Chainsaw in 1974", saying that "salvation" is credible would be immature. This could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very entertaining ride full of action. It is one of a great pile of exploitation pills from the early 70's (arguably) sitting on top of that pile and it acts great, superb cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
