Rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of the season's proportions, which could be kept away from many films looking for a similar plot pianist. Fortunately, from Trotta, a good browser storyline, opts for a feminist peep in an overly illustrated era on its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary German deniers rather than a Jewish viewpoint . Rosentrasse finds its strength in the grief of those who are trapped in historical circumstances in which they emerge as victims. The pace of the film is introspective, intense gently, meditative. In addition, the characters are to stay alive during transition between generation and pass through time that has been deftly fabricated. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrow faults are well recognized. Another fault lies on a trivial sinematography can take the intensity of the internal drama live in the characters. But this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the recent German film-related trends with ghosts in a recent nightmare, trends including such films such as Nowhere in Africa, and lately, the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this movie to anyone who knows how to read it beyond the images.
