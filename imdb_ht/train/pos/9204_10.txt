The story of rabbit Rama Hare Krishna has actually reached Dev Anand's head when he saw hippies and their falling value in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests before he Pujari First in Calcutta. He gave in to mind because his film was opposed to some of the burning premieres of Prem Pujari. But the life of Hippie re triggered a story of Dev's idea to be made in a movie. This was the Dev Anand perhaps better directive effort. The movie was a super hitch blockbuster in the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister made a big impact. <br /> <br /> This movie called Dev Anand in the nation maintains moral values. <br /> It's about a American-based Montereal family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister. But the parents are separated from Prashant (Dev) and Mom and Jasbir (Zeenat) and father. It is repeatedly said that his mother and brothers are dead and he eventually believes that he will never see Prashant again. <br /> It is sickly treated by her stepmother and she runs away from home. Will grow up to a pilot and learn that Jasbir is in Kathmandu and certain mortgages. <br /> <br /> To meet with her sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz) who was later married to Janice who in fact is Jasbir with a new name and identity. He also forgot his kids and Dev. <br /> <br /> Her find her sister back among other things including that she was suspected of being a thief in Kathmandu and the people after her life. <br /> This was a well-directed and acting story by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Hama than in Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev was first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the movie. He was very close to Dev and his earlier premiere Prem Pujari, though good, but opposed to Calcutta. Burman Da wanted to try a light topic as she thought film hippie films could recite angry people against Dev. But Dev continued with the film to reassure Burman Da and the movie was a success. <br /> R Burman had the Asha Bhosle award award winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re has been another good number. <br /> In general it is a good movie.
