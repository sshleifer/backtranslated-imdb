In "The Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried te trayi. Now, Kriemhild is seeking revenge. He married Hagen, and in a series of events, finally engaging in a very radical (but fitting) action in the end. <br /> One of these things on watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portraits. The Attila Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is depicted as the unusual person from the east, perhaps an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not the fault of Fritz Lang who used the Hitler "Nibelungenlied" for the German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what Fuhrer likes about the story. However, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
