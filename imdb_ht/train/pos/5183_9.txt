<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it while being in college at the beginning of the 90's, and while I was not able to identify with the thirtysomethings of the movie, I felt that the story, character, and movie in general were headache. For the people who spoke negative at Summer Indian, feel free to stick to your Armageddon Armored Movies and leave these movies with a beautiful story, good for those who can appreciate them.
