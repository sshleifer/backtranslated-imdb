Sarah Silverman is such a totally fake Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm in love already. Yeah, if you loved Jesus is magic, you will love this. If you did not, what the heck is wrong with you? Kudos Channel of Comedy to remove this from my face. My life ultimately has meaning, and "Cars or odors like Farts" are my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I'm hungry looking forward to next week. This is like Grass meeting South Park. Completely outrageous. Sara Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book. Its delivery is precise and so funny. He does not skip a beat. Come to think of it, it's not so much choice in material. which is some really good thing in the way, as it is the way it chooses to save it. Thanks, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
