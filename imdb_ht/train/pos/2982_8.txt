I enjoy this flicker. I am in firm belief that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the sophisticated genius of our time. They have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity in pop culture and make it redo but in a realistic way ... if that makes any sense. This is especially what makes South Park soooo funny. Once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever, you see in every episode the message being targeted. That is noticeable in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and it is absolutely ridiculous, he has a heartfelt message about America's corporate and shame that is big league sport. I am also a fan of sports so I get this hilarious movie at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people love hating. The opening prologue is brilliant ... water out of laughs every time I see those football players starting to riverdance! Some might not like this movie because just by everyone's cup was ... but just like South Park, once you look past the absurdity ... it has a really genuine message that transmits in literal comic genius . I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
