The Devil's rise, like the Angle Mountain's Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers must see it at least twice as its artistic nuances deserve to be on understanding. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another movie war, they will thus capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your beliefs to mankind. After seeing many killings, many suffering, you do not feel yourself inferior, instead of treating the bond between human beings more. Performance actors' haunt your heart, the music drives yourself. There are some shoots, not only some photos, they overlook themselves, come to see the soul. These are the true meanings of films being an art of art. <br /> A movie like this does not need comment or comment time, everything it says alone. Ovation of the cast including Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the Cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
