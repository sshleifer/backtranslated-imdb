Finally! An Iranian film not performed by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a document that is not documented, an entertaining black comedy and subversive young girl subtly kicking the 'system' into her ass. It's all about football and its comic, its really funny. The director says "The real locations, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. That's why I hope that they do not use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of fake." Those who are not actors will have rooting right up unless they are. your heart is made of b. you are blind. Excellent scripted, films in the challenge of patriarchal authority and an almost absurd freshness. He won the Grand Prix Jury, Berlin, 2006. Dear readers, it's also close-up. WHERE, where can I find it?
