This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, illustrating mythical fantasy. Some of the characters are straight from his painting (dealers of death were the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to maintain the feel of the original art. Bakshi is well known for its heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of drawing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the film is quite realistic (all the characters are human), this works very well. <br /> But what I really like here is the draw: for once we have a story with interesting characters and beautiful action sequences, a really horrible villain and a gorgeous babe. This film has feelings of best Coman Comics, not surprising since Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from Conan alive the action is alive, not talking about all the b-movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
