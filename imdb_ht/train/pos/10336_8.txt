This one is hard to look - as an earlier review says. This is amazing to consider the terrible films that came out right after WWII - particularly the "release" of Dachau. It is clear that, as in the middle of the war, we knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The sequence showing a "transport" is vivid, almost as if based on a current newsreel (the Nazis have loved registering atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He charted a Nazi career. This graphic is particularly said when contrasted with the reaction of other Germans, at first Hitler's horror, then incredulous, and finally discouraged. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in "conversion" to one Nazi youth officer in an anti-Nazi position. This happened, as witnessing several attempts at Hitler, most probably the plot of Staffenberg held as this film came out. A strong movie, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicts the Nuremburg trails and others that would happen once the war ended.
