This is an amazing movie with all the actors and actresses and lots of good! Though some of the actors and actresses were not very popular in business shows it seemed like they had been acting since they were one year old! It was funny, gross and just all out a pretty good movie. In most parts I just did not know what will happen next! I was like I think this will happen, wait I think this will happen. All the age groups will love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I could not believe what I saw! I definitely will see this movie again! He is one of those movies where he can not get bored. Every time you see it is so suspense. I definitely recommend seeing this movie !!
