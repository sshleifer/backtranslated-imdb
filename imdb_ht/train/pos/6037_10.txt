What a British GREAT movie, a good laughing scream and sexy Gary stretch, and oh, lots of bikes and beautiful country country. <br /> <br /> Members of our club ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as spending! Hooray !! <br /> <br /> Some bits are really hilarious, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> Met the director Jon Jonvay at a show at Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down the earth with a good laugh. This film should be supported, as all big gross cinema would be! <br /> So please go and see if you can, have a website that has movies showing it, so get one close to you! /> <br /> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have seen the movie two or three times already and can not get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
