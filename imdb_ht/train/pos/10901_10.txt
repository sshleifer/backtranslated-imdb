This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and is still a very tragic concern. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never gives up to people and spread his love. Looking at minutes in his life long fight was heart-wrenching. Hearing her smart smartphone remarks and seeing her adorable gesture was heartwarming. And seeing her smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to be able to handle this small giant. Please, if you ever have a chance to watch this movie - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
