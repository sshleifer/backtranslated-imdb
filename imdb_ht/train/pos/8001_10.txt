Certainly one of the finest films I've seen for some time. Excuse direction and unprecedented action to do this is a very fun and often moving movie. Denzel Washington plays one of the most engaging and emotional roles it to date, and the rest of the cast does very well. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his party although he did not appear as often as I would like. A history of final design that offset an innocent and loving child. This is also a movie for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. Where Mexico City adds a sense of tranquility and corruption in itself is an eye box. All in all, a movie is really entertaining since the beginning of the end. Highly recommended!
