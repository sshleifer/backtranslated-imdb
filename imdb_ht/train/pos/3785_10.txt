This movie is very mekon. It's very imaginative, creative and smart. It's just plain fun and in my opinion this movie's top one first. But the movie was forgotten when it first came out, and it became even more neglected as the years passed. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" is also bombed at the box office, whereas the first one was a very good and very popular hit. <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie has just released a couple of years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted were already "80s" so. Even though the '80s were only a couple of years ago back in that time, the landscape of music and style for children has changed so radically and rap gangsta, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound in Seattle . Bill and Ted and Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Gun 'n' roz music along with the '80s' style have seemed out of place and outdated in '91, and I think that one great reason to film the bombed office box. Nobody but surfer always said things like "Excellent!" and "bog!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2" which also came from the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good movie that bombed the box office because it was too closely associated with the' 80s. The transition from the '80s to the' 90s was a much faster shift then then with the '90s and'. 1991 there was nothing like 1988 or 1989, whereas current 2002 and last year 2001 seemed to have been similar to 1995 or 1996. <br /> If only "Excellent Adventure" held in 1988 was released by the previous year from 1989, and "Bogus Journey" made quickly and released in 1989, then it too late probably was just as wildly received as the first.
