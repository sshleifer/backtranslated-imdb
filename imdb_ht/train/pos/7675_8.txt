After watching the movie last night I left with a sense of despair facing the organization trying to tackle issues in the movie show. The scale of the prostitution looks so great that it's hard to see how it can beat without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on and review. is a domestic film and a comfortable home relationship that is a very compelling movie, and I would even go so far as to say it was enjoyable. The film was well edited for the run time and the performance by Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt Ron Livingston was playing a very tough role. <br /> <br /> It would be good to have a little more insight into why Patrick feels he helped Holly, but perhaps the reason is a simple way to explain Chris Penn's character. I will not explain it here - go see the movie. This is a good, thought-provoking movie with obviously good intentions. I hope it gets a fairly large enough to reach a decent audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
