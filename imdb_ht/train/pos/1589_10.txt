I love this show. I watched all the reruns every day though I've seen all of them like 6 times in each. <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes live with Val when their father transfers to Japan. Val has the perfect life, it has a companion and a perfect apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the issues Vall and Holly go on. The main problem is guys, but also about being responsible for other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is a total total spirit while Val is opposite to complete. It is organized to have a plan to make any kind of person. The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.
