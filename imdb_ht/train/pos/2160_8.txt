This film is about a man who was too upset with the accepted concept of success, trying to be ever uply mobile, hard work so he might be proud to own his own home. It is supposed that this is all there in life until it accidentally takes up dancing, all because she wants to get a closer look at a beautiful girl that she sees by the dance studio every day while riding the train on her way home . <br /> She was infatuated with her first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but she eventually allowed her to go and become herself in the dance. It eventually becomes apparent that there is more to life than working yourself to death. There are a number of oddball characters also learned from the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of liaison between the breakfast. There are also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving some depths not to show past injuries and struggles to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also engaged, with the big competition in the end, but it is not the usual story where we are undervalued from the top not having it. Instead, there is decomposition, revelation and redemption. <br /> All these make it a moving movie with pleasure to watch.
