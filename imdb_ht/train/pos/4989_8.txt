This is very dating, but that's part of the charm and this movie of 1933. You can say the same thing for most Pre-Code films; They were just different, and usually in an interesting way. It was the short run, great act of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful and sweet face of Loretta Young's character who kept me watching and enjoying this stagy-but-intimate movie. <br /> You should be hard-pressed to find a beautiful girl than "Trinna," played by the 20-year-old Young who has already made her 50th film! (It began to act as a toddler. This, with the fact, made movies quickly back to the old days.) The camera, although in soft focus throughout the movie, zoomed on Loretta's face and eyes Many times and I've been fomine by her beauty. Playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life, the Bill "Tracy" slowly transforms into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer released his line here and those natural that you hardly knew he was acting. Although they have small roles, support actor Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions after watching this 75-minute film. I was particularly fascinated with the role of Connolly as the minister / father of the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a little far-fetched but - hey - that's the movies. This story is about really Depression Great Depression trying to survive in a "Hooverville" type camp and winds up to be a very touching story.
