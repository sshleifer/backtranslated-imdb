I saw this first movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the scenario, the characters, the environment. As far as film is concerned I would not call that a big movie but for what it supposed it is fantastic. It gets that mean through. The cast is perhaps as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For what did not see it, I'll give you a brief summary: Criminal cards encountered in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friends on a bank heist. However when friends were arrested by two cops who chased him out of New Jersey, they tried to figure out what's going on and all loose hell breaks. The movie is really a big commercial bank robbery and is sort of like a poor mass version of the eleven Ocean, only with four criminals who can not stand with each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if love laughs I would encourage you to see this movie.
