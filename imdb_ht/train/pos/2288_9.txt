It's so rare to find a literary work properly translating the screen that I could have rated this movie much higher than it deserves, but not much. As a longtime student of Vonnegut's work, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those who love him as I do. The inspired casting: Nolte is understated in triumph, disorientating to defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is appetizing at all, but touches her in the treacherous and crescendo tragic reassembly she almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a totally traditional but equally treacherous, Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Do not feel you have it Mother Night to appreciate the movie; though, if you do not read Mother Night, you'll probably want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Notice the schedules of black-and-white colors and back again, and do not miss the final symbols of Campbell's Campbell. Look, too, for Short Vonnegut to reach the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The "White Christmas" Bing Crosby will never sound even (I write in mid-December, when this song is getting big radio play, and it's driving me black).
