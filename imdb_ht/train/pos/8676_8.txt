Tom's cat, Jerry Mouse, and Spike the dog (here's called Butch, his third name, second being 'Killer') decides to sign a peace treaty at all to love each other. It is strange and a bit unnatural to see them all buddy friends like this and their friends seem to think so too. But at the end thanks to a discord on a stick, everything is back to normal and all is how it should be. This short is the second one of three on DVD in new documents to be edited and I have no clue why this one was. This cartoon can be found on one DVD disc in the Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Class: B
