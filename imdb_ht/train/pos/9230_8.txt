There are many who can say about this movie. It's not your typical exploit. Of course, there are stripping and sex with nuns, but that's almost incidental in the story. <br /> It is set in 15th century Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians takes up a good part of the movie. It was interesting when everyone was running out of Muslim purchases, that the superior mother would ask, "Why do you fear Muslims, they will not do anything that Christians have done to you?" Certainly, there were enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) sent to a convent to challenge her father. In the process, he witnessed and endured many things: the cap of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new Duke, the torture of a man who had been overcome during a visit to the Tarantula Sector, and a whisper itself he ran along with a Jew. The torture was particularly cautious and warm lattice was drained on the wet, and nip her off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia tied to continue to get into trouble as she questioned the male-dominated society in which she lives. He even asked Jesus why the father, son and ghost holy are all. <br /> <br /> Eventually, she meets the Muslim leader as her lover and their little pouch. Here is where you see more expensive than you can possibly enjoy at one time. But the tragedy is coming. He manages accurate sweet revenge on all, including the Duke and his father, but finds out that Muslim lover is treated exactly the same. She is a woman and that is all there in her. <br /> I will not describe what the holy men in the church have made this heretical to the end, but warned the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades. <br /> <br /> Fans fan will be satisfied and treated, but movie lovers will find lots of meat to digest.
