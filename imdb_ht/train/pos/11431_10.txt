My 3 year French class is still enjoying this movie. In a multi-cultural, high school interior, the film provides many subjects for discussion (in French in class, but I know a lot of discussions have gone into English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to one between Protée and France. I always mentioned that I felt this movie had one of the "sexiest" scenes I had ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American crying, "Yes!" when calculating the scene: one of the protied sides helps Aimée lace up his evening dress, all while both examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. Director uses the "ice cream" then wants to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more characters in one scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is "sexy". /> Most students have had difficulty understanding the movie's end. One suggests that a theme of the movie was "Africanism", and that no matter how much one loved African or African, one could not "become" African (like the driver tried to): one must be African.
