I'm going to be honest, I finally checked this film not because of the stars - even though they were reasonably looked and compelling, particularly the three - or even convinced stories of a violation of the Presidential Services Service (something, informing of the DVD extras in this show, has yet come to an end.Evite is true, this remarkable!). I received it because it was ruled and there was a choice of no other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favs from "Omizid: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mainly) TV director. I would say that it does as good as it can with a project that is occasional but pretty average, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and ace secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) found out who was his blackmail and killed his friends, aiming and blew up a Air Force One chopper and It is gunning for the Pres. (David Rasche. Anyone remembers "Sledgehammer"?). His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first lady ladies ever had, fictional or real) is certainly not helping his stand. He got to both cold out the real mol of service and avoid the dog hound as his oldest best friend hunting with fellow agents and chiefs (Kiefer Sutherland, almost always in fashion "24"). Throw in some other pivotal service agents (Martin Donovan and the foxy, somewhat hard to buy as Eva Longorria's gig) and alien shady characters and have a fairly gigantic political actress who does not aim as high as he pretends and arrives in the wish, if underwhelming, the results. <br /> <br /> The summary line is on the best way to describe how this show plays without giving away spoilers. DVDs in addition to them seemed to be more perspicacious and interesting than the movie, even though the movie itself was fun enough to hold most (myself included) interested.
