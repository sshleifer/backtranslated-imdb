Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governing South Africa in much the same way as Gandhi tried to resist the colonial British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film The Freedom Call is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as he is on Donald Woods, the white newspaper editor who deliberately lives his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a change of point of view following Biko's death in prison of terrorist behavior in the hands of African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and run the country to publish book on Biko or to allow his wife to play by Penelope Wilton, to pressure him to forget about the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods is degenerated into a standard by the numbers saved on the border wire after Biko's death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good in her fourth film as Biko, but something wrong with a movie that attempts to show the writings of Apartheid does not focus more on the trials of a white family for more than half the movie. Attenborough would have served his best interests by concentrating on Biko's rise in prominence rather than starting up where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour movie was not exactly conducive to large box office, but the movie was a great floppy office box anyway. Political film aside, the movie is still amused and sent a message or two, albeit, to PG-sanitized fashion. *** of 4 stars.
