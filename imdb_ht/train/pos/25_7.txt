I never saw this when I was a kid, so this was seen with fresh eyes. I've never heard of it and rent it for my 5 year old daughter. Plus, the idea of ​​Christopher Walken singing and dancing makes me curious. The special FX is cheesy and the song and dance is mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter has been transferred. I liked to watch Walken in this role to think about what the future was designed for him. Very fun to see him dance! But if the songs were not big, at least they did not Disney on-the-product bags. The oggin scene from the beginning was a bit scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw her again in the end, but she was mostly benign. Interestingly, we had just read "Chats in Boots", and I asked about the implosity of the story. But while remaining true to almost every aspect, acting Walken has made it credible. Great fun. I would look at her again with my daughter.
