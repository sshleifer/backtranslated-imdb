I noticed at once that this film really was not based on the novel Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a nice idea that son Pongo and the Perdita now had his own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little snowball that was completely stained until the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely kind. In fact, I have often thought of the possibility that it could become friendly, but now that it is so quickly changed to "herself" again and it was announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost started to really worry on Chloe's Dalmatians. > <br /> Actually, the scene in which the puppies looked Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, they were better than I expected. I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs learned many tricks for this movie. <br /> In my course was the end of the Dalmatians being saved again, but I would like to know what was going to happen to Cruella after he lost all his property. And what about the world could the dogs' houses do with such a large sum of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was well touched that Snowball also had to spot the very end of the movie.
