Gosha last big movie in the 1960s. A stylist resonates with a great sense of its film purpose, Gosha teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (at Zatoichi Fame) to produce this escalating scandal in mindless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (judgment in the sky) is the word that loyalists give the emperor call while murdering enemies or "treacherous" in the cause. Katsu plays up his character simple minded loyalty to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone asking the politician marks a "treacherous" and gets a target assassination. One of the best movie pictures ever, many shots are incredible compositions of shape, color and light. The scene fights are often and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the Gosha color palette used for its image. Gorgeous and disturbing. While the personal story is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic story lesson for this time in Japan would be very useful to fight in the movie without it. The few disadvantages of the film are the music track, the length and the Katsu landscape scenery. He has a drunken scene in the way for a movie but actually a very accurate illustration of a drink. <br /> <br /> Downbeat but one of the great movie chambara.
