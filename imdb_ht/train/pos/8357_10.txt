A wonderful, free flowing, often lyrical movie that whiskks you together, always smiles, though there is really shocking incident on the road. A gasps in the path of women are treated and yet finally seem to come in very well and it's a lot of credit to all concerned that so potentially disaster scenes all work for very well. This is the best Depardieu's performance, certainly it's more natural. Jeanne Moreau performs exceptionally in what has to be a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes and a couple of guys at least half his age. Miou-Miou is beautiful at all and yet there are scenes very difficult to play. Initially this looks like a downside and misogynist Rant / Fars room but as the story and character unfold a more sensitive and honest positioning picture. At the end of this movie compromises and daring demand respect.
