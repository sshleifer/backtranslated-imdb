I saw this germ in a movie in Cannes where he was part of the passenger director. Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun at all, and all members of a strong cast acting their socks. It is a sometimes laughing comedy about a little thief (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison he meets a `lifer 'who tells him in the' ultimate bellini '?? what for you and me ?? is a sure-fire to get rich rapid scheme. It seems that there is a way out of a deserted building in the city jewelry stores? which could be millions of dollars. Sounds simple? ?? well drown in all wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have to lift the ingredients for a wild one ride !! ?? words pass through a low life deficit in the next and soon a team of them reunited with cash in Cosimos `Bellini 'pans by failing Pero boxers (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell ?? surely a star of the iron) Hesitated by Robeline Riley (William H. Macy) who was forced to bring her baby with her as her wife was locked up for fraud !! Based on the Italian film I Soliti Ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street) that also inspired a movie similar to `Collinwood '?? Palookaville. This striking spot in the latter effort and although written and written by the Russo brothers it definitely has shades the Coen brothers on it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small yet hilarious party as a safer breaker.
