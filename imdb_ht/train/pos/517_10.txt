The most prominent Pressburger and Powell films. David Niven plays RAF Bomb Pilot missing his own death but gives a second chance to life when the sky notes that he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene of the young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, reaching the sky to be treated for eternal life is incontestably intense. Look out for Roger Livesey, a deeply appreciated actor, and Kim Hunter as the love interest (later, of course, the planet Zira of the Apes). Behind, Steven Spielberg threw the actress who played the leading angel (Kathleen Byron) as the senior wife of the eponymous privately-owned Private Ryan half a century later, an act of speaking volumes for his cinema literacy.
