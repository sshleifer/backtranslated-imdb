Without question, this movie should be one of the greatest ........ in cinematic history. I have it many times to remember, and every time it is like I see the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where does one start? Meena Kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest in his career, followed by Sahib Bibi Ashur Ghulam and Phool Aur Pathar. Each movement and nuances of its performance, make any other Bollywood heroine talk of meaning. His master's interpretation of Kathak coupled with his favor, the tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen. Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, rich cinematography and stage performing scenes, are so packed with symbols and meanings that the viewer leaves without breath. Naushads music, is unsurpassed, its knowledge of the music of the gharanas streams is incredible, and the way in which it punctuates the narrative and atmospheric black motifs and melodic romance melody is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoyed the spectacle of total movies,
