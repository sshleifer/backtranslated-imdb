In Manhattan, the average American class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two young daughters in a four-room and a toilet-only bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency raising US $ 15,000.00 a year and feels comfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When she saw an advertisement in a large house for sale in the country in Connecticut for an affordable price, she drove to his wife and the real estate agent and decided to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sent a friend engineer to inspect the house, and the man said he should put down the house and build another. Jim checks information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner its find that he has bought a "pit money" instead of a dream home. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Build His Own House" is a very funny comedy, with witty line and top-notch scenario. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse to realize and the American dream of owning a big house that finds that made bad choices, while losing his hand in his work and feeling jealous of his friends, . In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie to see the inspiring classic this "The Money Grow". My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Larger, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Wounds")
