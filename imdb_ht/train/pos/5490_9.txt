This really is an incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal battle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to find their legitimate voices but also shows the United States up to its dishonest, subterfuge, and blaghens disrespect for human rights and self-determination. . Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader against what can only be characterized as a jerky jerk devoid of any sense of proportions or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything before witnessing. <br /> And in the hair we see the USA, once again pull the strings and haze all sense of reality. It's heartbreaking to watch the first stages of the revolt to know well as the democracy grant that we are witnessing is a long tool used by the successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The foot makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of television or generic foot but an active document of someone and his government fights for its future. Really a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish movie makers deserve our gratitude. Life Live Chavez. <br /> We need the consequence of the notion that every country should have the right to choose its government and develop in the majority of ways to see fit. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the facts are in the situation, and this documentary does a great job to do just that.
