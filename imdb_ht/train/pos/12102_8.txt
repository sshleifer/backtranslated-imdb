This starts a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Package package that this man can not spend a whole night in a creepy castle. Well, of course it can, but it will come out unscathed? Difficult to say and all those strange people who do not suppose to have lost his way, including Barbara Steele's glass. This is a fairly odd movie that the presentation is both in French and English, and switches back and forth a few times. Maybe this is done because the dialogue bits have been lost? It is also rather black and claustrophobic, that one does not see much beyond a circle of light that candles and generates, plus having a feeling of fear and future bankruptcy very much at all times. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored and I wonder what could be censored in a movie from 1964 until I saw the topless scene, I guess that would be it. Overall this is very good and in gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.
