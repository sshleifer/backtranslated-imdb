Stack should have received the Academy Awards for this period, period. It's a crime that he did not. Amazing how it is humanitarian a rich nobody. Dorothy Malone earned a well-deserved academy for her performance. In fact, all of the act of this movie is excellent. The draw begins with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then keep moving on an emotional ride that will keep your interest at all. You will be entertained! <br /> However, this is just a blatant soap opera. One dimension, the 100-percent plan. You could call it the ultimate compass, because the act so well triumph over the material. Excellent act, well directed, but strictly in its soap genre. I would not even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While they do not deny the great value of this great movie entertainment, you can only imagine what this talent is tossing and the director could achieve with more important subjects.
