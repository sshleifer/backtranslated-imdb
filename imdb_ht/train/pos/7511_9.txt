The film can be a glass to see the world in a new light. Good night and good luck, for example, offer parallel to modern-blood-proof judgments and liberty encroachments. It is easier to examine a moral problem when it's not too close to home: do not put it in a fictional or historical context to remove from our immediate situation. With pornography, we consider ourselves 'illuminated' and our ancestors must hide from pagan ideas - usually involving fire and breath, but the definition of what obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence. Bettie Page was a cult icon in an era that included McCarthyism but the prohibition of comics (like Tales from the Crypt) on the basis that they would turn the teens into half-minute miners offenders. This film, developed in key issues raised in her life, poses as dilemma as important today as back in 1950. <br /> <br /> Our movie opens with two key performances. In the first, we see that well-dressed, respectable looking man in a sealed bookshop. One of them is asking for women photos of kinky boots and being prevented - then turns out to be a civilian cop to make a sting. The second scene shows Bettie Page, waiting to be called as a witness, looking very well, as if it were just out of church. <br /> <br /> The first 50mins are in black & white. Old movie movie films such as wet and missing towels add in the sense that we are watching a movie from last year, as well as performing their mismas at the cast, skilfully recreated 1950s, contemporary contemporary phrases and the terse dialogues associated with make the movie movie. Hiking Archive is often intercut - that will delight many and irritate others. In keeping with its theme, the film is almost a collection of different types of photography-in-motion, and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against Bettie's classic pose heard at an age of 'health and nature magazines' . . . although I admit that if you are not captivated by the story you can get the effect a bit chav. <br /> <br /> Very soon, we go to flashback. Bettie Night An Downtrodden Life Depression in Nashville, enlivened only with church and soul-saving songs, and goes alone to make his own way. After her initial success, her model work is divided into two strands: mainstream work globes that focus on the over-the-rain smile, and the 'specialist' interest photos involving dresses in high-heeled boots and light slave gear. At an earlier audition (reminiscent of a scene and Naomi Watts' character at Mulholland Drive - who also called Betty), it provides a full-featured emotional, contrasting and normal animated, happy (but ultimately bizarre) day -a day expression. Is part of it still unfulfilled? Bettie is often dismissed at audition once they realize she is the pin-up girl well-known. But we never asked to be sorry for Bettie Page: her abusive children quickly referenced and jumped over; when she was raped by four boys, we see only the threat and then Bettie retrieve and survive, picking himself up in Woodland Desert, and putting on the brave figure of a person who refuses to lie down and die. /> Although no stripping is involved, it's Bettie's special interest picture that will eventually excite trouble. When we return to the court, a religious opinion on the influence of corruption in these photographs was taken as evidence. An authorized psychologist tells how the pictures lead to 'kill himself, murder and psychosis' of the youth exposed to them (presumably not in this order). Eventually a star witness explained how her son's life came to an end as a result of these pictures - they were 'trussed up like that'. It does not make clear how 'trussed up' causes death). The text accompanies a series of Bettie's photos in a magazine saying how it was forced to hold 'terrible agony' with the fetish restrictions (the audience knows that it actually finds them quite hilarious and that the words, such as the photos themselves, they were dramatic pi). After a 12hr wait, Bettie said her proof - it's one person who could indicate that she was not photographed in agony - will not "be." 'Later' in the photographs have been proven. If this sounds like the dark ages that we left, consider a recent incident (2003) in which an Ann Summers announcement was banned. He said, "For whipping fashion and passion together in your local store," with a picture of a woman's back. He carried a bra and thong with his hands leaning behind him. The lingerie and gender sex company, which targets female consumers (and also supports charitable domestic violence organizations) said its announcement aims, "providing women with sexual confidence and always showing women in control of their sexuality." One could conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the Betty Page Investigations still keep money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The more realistic found in continental Europe. He might discuss the formula of sin and redemption, and "were saved," even reflected in the pattern of creation that perpetuates dominant domination of men. A policeman who makes a friendly (but sexually motivated) approach to Bettie outside the courtroom offers her 'escape' from solitude. The knight-in-the-shell gun could be chivalry, but it is also supposed to be a woman who needs help. <br /> <br /> Love it or hate it, Noti's Bettie Page is a strange and extraordinary movie, with a moral waking call for those who listen to it. There is excellent ensemble acting, and Gretchen Mol, as Bettie, is remarkable as the movie all succeeds or falls on its powerful performance.
