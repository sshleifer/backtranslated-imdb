David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people on finding out that reality would not even have to bother watching it. Ironically, they say the least. David has made his name on x- records and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addicted to the hit doctor for malpractice.By she is a private doctor for criminal mimeys Raymond Blossom. However the FBI takes an interest in using Eugene Trap Blossom. Angelina Jolie has been cast in the role of the clare-moll support gangsters wearing a solid performance. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom is superb and immerses himself deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think and in the end I would listen to his credible performance.Here accustomed to monotonous tones with the right face present but dosen't detract too much from the movie
