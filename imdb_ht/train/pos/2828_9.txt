After following it for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> Not disappointing because I'm one of those SMAP fans who need to see all their work and I finally got to see the so-called Hot Film in Goro. But I could not believe Goro was forced to make a movie like that. In her self respectable now, I'm sure she cringes that she made this movie. But they found the perfect person to look embarrassed, sick at ease and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many parts by believing he really did such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br /> But I'm glad to have looked at him. Thanksgiving has grown up ...
