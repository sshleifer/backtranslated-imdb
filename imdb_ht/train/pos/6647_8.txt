My grandmother Gandhi is like looking at a book, chapter by chapter or reading it (with your eyes) and learning more about Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi issues. So little known on both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. The head misleads though, it's as much a movie about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and her son, as it's about Harilal and her mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya make full justice for their respective roles. <br /> <br /> These films are like leap years. They come after only a lot of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> My grandmother Grandpa, also on an internal struggle, is sometimes more difficult than any liberty ever undertaken. <br /> Look, if you like good movies.
