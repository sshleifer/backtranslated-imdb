As most of you can cut off Star Wars: Thursday's return you can know it a good movie but as you might see on the videos M | could have a party at the end and just probably finished the movie with the party and there is no evil spirit or anything but on the original one (Live TV) when they're done but before I say more when Ben obi-wan dies of the Imperial ship Or star death saw him disappear and Yoda dies from old age or internal illness but because Luke kills Darth Vader (Real Name: Anakin Skywalker) when they all feast at the end when Luke or someone suspended the Spirit Off Ben and Yoda Stand in to him and smile while another spirit appears Do Darth Vader but not like A Sith as the ordinary Selve is ordinary on him and begins Smiling and Ben and Yoda I guess What made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should cut off to make a paddy cut spirit when Mace Windu and other Jedis who died and Younglings Under the Arms of th and back ground
