This story is a complex and wonderful story of the recent Harem of the Ottoman Empire, well said and provokes us to see the inner functions of a world now go and learn about the people who lived there. Enjoy the story, character, acting and scenes. A few scenes suffer from quick correction and sub subtitles sometimes disappear too fast, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> Safiya The main characters to play beautiful by Marie Gillain who I am happy to have done a fantastic job without about doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are good and beautiful. I recommend this movie for anyone watching something less Hollywood and more authentic in the world emulating.
