The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a streetcar clacking on the tracks. It is metaphorically for everyone who lives in the dump can not win. These misery is illustrated by the street than representing relatively unobtainable the rich life of the middle class. The boy's patient and his dear father again are so sadly crazy is the most touchy. This Kurosawa's first film was in color and used very well shocking tone, color seeing only in dreams. The film is surreal and excess of beauty. The Compassion for Humanity is the underling force, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the movie. It is a masterwork by a genius of cinema.
