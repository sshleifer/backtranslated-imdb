"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before getting married, just last year. <br /> It was also the first movie I was digging for, after I was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, reality is not apart from fiction. For those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend visiting my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For all others, I would only recommend seeing this movie before and after "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
