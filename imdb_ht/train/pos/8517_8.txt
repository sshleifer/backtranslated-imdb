At the same time, a landlord adoption agency owner took a mini-leaf or orphanage to the charge of his father (Leslie Nielsen). Harry's father is in the rental business and he gets the bright idea of ​​"renting" some of the children in the orphanage such as Russ and Valerie. Harry, who gets acquainted with the couple's dilemmas, offers a family of siblings for a 10-day rental period! Brandon, Kyle, and Molly move into the apartment with their parents for a while, with entertainment consequences, as the new riders are inexperienced with the kids. But where is the possibility of a happy ending? This is a darling family movie. The actors, including Nielsen as the Wheeler-dealer and Christopher Lloyd as the apartment door type, are all wonderful. The script is dynamic and fun with the overall production values ​​quite high.
