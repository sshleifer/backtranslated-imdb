Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see what's happening ... the rich did crazy things than that. And it was funny. <br /> I watch a comedy to be entertained, escaping from the pressures of the world for a while, and not having to take anything too seriously. This movie fully suits this purpose. I judge a movie on its own basis and I'm not about to compare Christmas Survival in blazing saddles. I look totally dysfunctional people grow up in caring, people who are likable who can easily live down the street from my house. It will stay on my list "favorite ..... be look for the holiday season". If you just want to have a 90 minute fun, look at this one.
