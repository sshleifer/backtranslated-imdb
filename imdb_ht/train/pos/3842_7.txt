A negative surreal drama that will push most people's buttons. The 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically incorrect. The story protagonist is a bisexual writer Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), and a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of all the evil and the modern man. It is change, delusions, able to control his incentive, fear of committing in meaningful relationships, with utter apathetic life in general. As the character itself states at one point, it is a professional liar, able to remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of Christ's consume spiders, and then wakes up to begin the long mass of his own destruction. She chases off <br /> one person (a presumably companion), then chase another at a train station. And at a conference, she meets a woman who seems willing to help her, or maybe she has more nefarious plans .. She quickly captures Gerard from her web, catches her with sex and money, there are many both. He also got <br /> secret, like three dead husband. Is it sole, and really looking for someone to feed - or is it a deadly widow, attracts Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the 4th Man to Kill? The girl is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does her best to keep you guessing what she's up to. This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue.

Highly recommended for fans of smart <br /> <br /> psychologically thriller, or anyone looking for something entirely new.
