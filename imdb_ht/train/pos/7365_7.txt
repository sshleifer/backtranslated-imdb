I found this touch as Spike and Heaton stay along the way in this movie by saying there is not a few betrayers on the road. I thought that the pursuit was set aside the relationship between the first plan I thought. I have already guessed that there was so gay intent on the Heaton part. My favorite scene was to be somewhat where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and my running spike generally thought Spike did not come back. I must say that if it was not for our science film teacher we looked at what I would probably never see. Overall I thought this film was very good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British film made.
