This movie is very fun and never boring even runs in almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and are very credible. The violence was a little extreme in the movie but then showed how vicious drug trading was at the time of the movie. The finish is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movies and you'll probably love it.
