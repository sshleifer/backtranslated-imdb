I have not seen this in over 20yrs but I always remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie could NOT be made in color. The big grays are what makes it, and was really really life in the 1950s ?? What means more out of my memory is Perry Smith going to the public square. It breathes under the hood just before the trap. I do not think I could watch it again ..... once it's a lot. It's like what guy names at the beginning of "Papillon" that drag out of the horror of the guillotine. The guy who said this on a double bill and "Dead Man Walk" should add 10 minutes to the "I want to live" too. <br /> Some of my ancestors were "aristos" going to the guillotine in 1794-95 so my feelings about sanctions for death are rather intense.
