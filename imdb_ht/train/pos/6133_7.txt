Easy to film the biggest movie support film at all times. The first time I saw this movie when I was about nine years old, and I said he scared the hell out of me. Now that I'm all grown, however, I see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone who has any taste, has dreamed to see a snowman going around murder, even if they will not admit it. I've always found something really scary about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie like myself, thismovie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is funny, or otherwise canceled in any intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell you expected? Anyone who gave this movie a low score is obviously too overwhelmed to sit back and have a good laugh at the stupid one-liner covered with cheap. I like this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry got up and made a serious movie grab on a killer shutter (which seems impossible, unfortunately) I'll forever hold this great piece of horror indie close to my heart.
