Finnish version of Robert Altman in "Short Cut", put in the rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and despair, despair and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-worker: he spreads an overwhelming joy in love and life. The other episode featuring old men dead at a hospital with his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is how old couples must fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital and the contrast solitudes and the "routines" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional sympathy). Compared with Altman's classic, this film is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.
