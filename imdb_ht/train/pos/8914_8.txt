I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry walked. I remember all my family going from watching the filming. I remember a guy who showed the "pate" me and my brothers in a bucket. I also want to share that my mom was in the movie. Her hair style was similar to Aneta Corsaut and she was sick an evening and saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind. They paid $ 25.00 and gave him a story to say until it passed away in August. My mother was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my younger sister.
