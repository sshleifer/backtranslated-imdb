Make sure it's well done and done, beautifully shot and made! But the story was just weak. And painting in Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good but the character he played was nothing but someone. You mean that I said Lincoln had a smart donkey wisdom with no respect of the law or the court. I mean who the hell was supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, "I'll just call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford has gone for great guy hero hero but I did not really like this Guy at all. It cheats in sports, speaks like a real sweet smile and does not seem to know they were sitting in a courtroom. How should I take this seriously. The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like he thought up in some 5 years old in his dreams. He says that I liked it enough, it was very fun and made me laugh at several occasions so I can not tell it to a bad movie. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing to entertain me and make me laugh can be bad but this story is alive and funny was just so ridiculous that I can not understand how someone would consider it great. > <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if any of it was true I would really have to shake myself.
