Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Do not expect the production value of a theater release, but it expects the highest quality of video output. <br /> It is set up as Timon & Pumba starting to look at the original King Lion in a dark theater and suddenly change train and begin to tell their own story. This is done frequently and comedy interruptions. For example, during a moment moments of tension a commercial home trading pops on with a pumba chagrined to realize he's located on the remote. These moments pepper the film, and if you find them fun or will not much depend on your sense of humor. If you are particularly harassed by movies that deliberately remind the viewer watching a movie, this may not be your cup. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best to invest in the DTV Disney line, and is integrating almost transparency with the original material. New, independent materials use a lot in the artistic style of the original. The voice talents are all done well, though I could not help thinking of Marge Simpson whenever I heard Julie Kavner. Many of the jokes in the film will be well recognized by viewers as recycled on the generations, but they are presented more and more familiar to lovers of old friends than annoyingly rehearsing. <br /> <br /> The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good integrated music with a Disney feature. The toe-tapping opening feature of 'digging a tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. Timon and Pumba take over the opening of the King's Lion and their paradise for fun too. The only problem was repeated in 'digging a tunnel' at the end of the film, switching to its lyrics and tuneups from uplifting defects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The new story does not seem to touch saccharin or moments emotionally charged properly, and does better when he removes full comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it. For the penchant pincher who always wants to invest on a good movie flick, wait until it drops down to four or more dollars and goes out immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
