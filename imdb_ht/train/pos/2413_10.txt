Love the TV show. The first weekend I saw it was. Want I had to act in with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life and, then, in a turn of events that you encounter someone else and that person is the one that you want to be together. You are in a situation you chose one or the other. Someone will get hurt, there is no stop. Make the decision difficult but you want to go on being happy when you could. Why go in and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought you were doing right things and you could both be happy. That other people will not wait for a waiting time, they have a good life. Make the decision that you really want to be the best at the end. Make the best of what you have is a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc. .... Do not be happy, having one person that you really want and share it with.
