This movie came and went to theaters. Due to the nature of it you can see why it was not well received. It was unjustly panned because of its subjects more than the actual movie itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good movie that tried to talk about a feared topic in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Draw / Story: Superior learning is mainly centered around Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive track star who has to deal with not being fast enough, with a tough teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). She befriends Fudge (Ice Cube) as well as a gorgeous lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later on to finish having to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (played by Michael Rapaport) is confused by the kid who ends up befriending some local skater on the campus. Once the views are over, it becomes as racist as it is. <br /> <br /> Opinion: The higher learning is not without its flaws: character development is scarce, performing okay by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads (whose name is forgotten), Busta rhyme fit into this movie at all. Plus women turn gay after being abused by people have shouted 'before this movie so you know I did not like this part of the movie with Kris Swanson. Other than that, this movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was a good teacher Phipps (though I was able to do without the emphasis), Fudge was the best ice cube performance and Michael Rapaport was good at Remi's confused. All in all it was one of John Singleton's best movies and is one of the reasons why I'm tired of the garbage he's out now. Cinema needs more movies such as Superior Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast Fury 2 and a very pointless rumor of axes.
