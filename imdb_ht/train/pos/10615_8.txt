The Unseen is done in a more style like Hollywood's old mystery than a horror show. The film is a bit slow, but many of the imaginative imagery keep it film alive and look. The basic idea of ​​tight girls by something in the basement is old but good acting and producing the movie worth watching. The film is remarkable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it an 8 out of 10.
