This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look pretty much. Soha reminds you of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is an actor who is born and he will rise much in the future. Finishing in the movie is very different from most movies. In a way you are left unhappy but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that only the tender ending ended up showing off the movie. Otherwise, it would have a gross injustice for everyone. The film is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in the court. His companion does not show up and end up being helped by the witness. Slowly, over time, she falls in love for her. It is unclear if it has similar feelings for it or not. Watch the movie for complete details. The movie really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is beautiful, but did not speak much of the movie. His eyes, his innocence makes the most of the talk.
