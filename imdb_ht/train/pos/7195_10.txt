I loved this exit series of republics! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even hard, the picture quality was not in the best, but OK. The fence in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They only have to practice some more. As I told the story is GREAT! You are just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! He is the same guy who is the musician for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, which is the Fighting Legionist musician. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and these are the Legionarians! I highly recommend this set. Buy it! <br /> I love that Reed Hadley playing Zorro! It's funny, clever and brave! Mark: 6.
