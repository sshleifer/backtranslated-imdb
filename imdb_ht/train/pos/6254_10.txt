I just saw this film in the 2001 International Toronto International Film Festival. The working title was 'dog day'. The audience's reaction was mixed. Some people have found gender in graphics and realistic violence to be too much for them. Others seemed to really appreciate how good this movie was. This movie is not for fantastic hearts. It's like 'Happiness' with clear sex and a less optimistic look at humanity. There is animal poisoning, a strip strip from an elderly citizen, an orgy'esque bathing in a mall, penetration candle in the back, and mental incompetent discomfort. <br /> If any of this sounds like too much to handle then this movie is not for you. This film shows mankind's most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is pushed to our face with the utmost water. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in humanity limited here. And why should it be? This film features excellent performance at all involved, is always interesting, and is probably the most smart social statement to be performed on the movie a moment.
