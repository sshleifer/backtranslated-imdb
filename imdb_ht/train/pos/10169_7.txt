Over his dead body was a nice little movie. It was decent and fun, while still being very funny. There was a few clich√©s, but I found more cool things. At first I did not think he was going to do good at all when he started out.If you can get past the first 20 minutes though, the movie starts getting more interesting. This movie did not burst out of hilarious laughter, and they did not oh my gosh wonderful.It was just a movie that you can sit and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.I do not see how this movie was bad.It's the rating is just a bit too low. Could I have to deal with a 5.5, but a 4.8? Also, giving this movie a 1 is disappointed. It was very good, and there was nothing horrible about giving it a 1, which is what most people gave it.
