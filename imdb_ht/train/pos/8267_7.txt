Brown at Harvard is a tough film gushing down. We hope so much more in our movies these days, so it helps remind the audience of the 20s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is good as the naughty who has to stumble in pain and humiliation to get success, and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, Nerd City. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports ... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
