This is a well-documented documentary on the exciting world of Indy Car Racing. The photography is simply exceptional. The scene was Mario Andretti driving the old bike bike down the New England street lined with the ancient maples, leaves blown by the sea by the speed of the car, is incredible. The movie loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like watching car driving through the boundaries you should see this movie.
