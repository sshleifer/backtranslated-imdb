I had long waited for this film ever since I saw the trailer, which made it a political drama, starting three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, Jan Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done unmatched work, he and Pacino have been combining SEA in love, which rank among each of their best works. But interference on some levels (for starters, several of the scenes of the original trailer does not appear in the movie) and switch to tones (subsequent trailer makes it seem a thriller) to do this, while watching, nowhere too as it could have been. <br /> <br /> Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There has been great potential here to be a movie about how the government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption and make a complex statement about what corruption, not the good guys against bad guys. And there is good act here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances in his career. But Fonda is wasting his role, nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central scenario, when he returns to a thriller, the movie wandering, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino , and then dropped down to the end. I wish I would like this more, but no.
