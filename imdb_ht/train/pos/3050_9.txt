This is merely the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Acting in bad, bad script, bad scenery, bad suits, bad camera work and special effects are so stupid that you get yourself curled and laughing. So it will not win an Oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can not go wrong.
