I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very pleased with it and truly could not ask for more. I actually own the movie because I did not return it to someone ... What I should do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I loved it. Also, the fact I do not own too many foreign films and this is a prime. Now I personally love Finnish things, which definitely adds to how much I loved it. But in general, it's worth watching. However, if you are not at all trying to understand Finnish or read bit subtitles, then this movie is not for you. <br /> 9/10 for sure.
