There are many things to fall into Arbo Tolbukhin. In the middle of the month (Inside the killer), it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in movies but really, really great to do. It made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin read as a movie made a document or viceversa, most specular relay aspects of the doubt that you ask, did he really exist? The movie follows the life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he has taken and punished death penalty. The movie begins because some French documentaries were interested in this character for his interview before his death. Nowadays, there are some more people involved and doing a deeper search of the character. One of us is witnessing in-the-movie. <br /> <br /> For the main part of the story we are guided by a slow-moving phase to look inside Aro's mind, especially to decode why he did what he did. But the important thing is that the movies never gave us a point of view; They have left the judge for all of us and as we can understand his actions, we are clearly never justified. So the first half is based on recollection info; Later things turn into Aro's children, giving the film as an incredible new strength (even tough never been weak or boring). <br /> I do not mean - and do not want to - spoil anything; So the only thing left to say is that if not any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.
