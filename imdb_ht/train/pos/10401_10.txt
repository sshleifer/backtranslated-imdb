Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be short. "The Baghdad Thief" was my favorite movie as a child, and she never stopped surprised or enchanted me. I loved this movie from the first time I saw him, when I was a boy of six who started reading the "Arab Nights." I remember walking in the TV room in the midst of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and they were instantly inflated. <br /> <br /> Raramans have plenty of beauty, magic, and amazement captured on film. Sabu and Jan Justin are superb as the superbly heroes, Conrad Veidt is very delightful as the wicked Jaffar villain, and Rex Ingram is a joy to look like the sardonic genius. Georges Perinal's photographs are some of the best used in Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a cinematographer who has been accusing critics but is often neglected by audiences for his remarkable film, including "A Matter of Life and Death" (aka "Staircase in the Sky") and "Red Shoes." She is one of the true masters of the camera, right standing there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles. Like all the beautiful works of art, the beauty of the "thief of Baghdad" lies in the details. Each frame has its own magic charm. The story never shakes, and the characters and actions are always involved. Here is a movie that will never grow old.
