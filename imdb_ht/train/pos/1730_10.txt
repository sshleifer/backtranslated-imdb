This quiet quiet thanks to the true story of a POW escape during WW II. The incredible performances, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. The dialogue is inventive spirit and very true ring. In fact, an all-around autonomy is unusual to put this one top-and-shoulder head above the most epic war.
