I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality of this comment. Also, this comment will be most significant to you after you see the movie. Although it is sad to say sad, that film brings a resemblance to my life that is so hit that it is really scary. The rest you will never know how accurate film shows how people in situations like that act and react in later life .. This could not have been a work of fiction; It should be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the good movie was shown by the fact that, although it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, watching my life described on the silver screen was such a painful oneness experiences that I will never be able to see it again. <br /> But I endorse it gladly to everyone else as a fellow companion of the soul of another person to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will evermore. I know that for a fact, because my soul is going to be observed.
