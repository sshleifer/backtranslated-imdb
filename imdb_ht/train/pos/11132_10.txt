Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is being shaken by a haunted haunt. He has a strong fear and hatred religion due to his traumatic baptism. He left his job as a dishwasher and went out to become a hustler for the rich. He meets a misfit called Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other out. They have become robbers. Two are grown considerably close and soon can not live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso has not said Joe, and it can destroy any hope that they have to survive the city together. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a heartbreaking portrait and breakage of too lonely people who have nothing to lose but with each other. History is devastating to watch, but it is ultimately important for people to see. It's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like those you seem to crazy you sometimes get on the street. The difference is that this movie is from the perspectives. Their lives are shown to us and the devastators see the pedestrians of this film treated like dust, especially if we at one time were one of those people. However, the film does not try to culminate your journey. Instead, it shows you the rough side in the form of unrest. It's not a beautiful and lively life like Hollywood movie many show it as MILK money and good women. The shape of being a male hustler is a dirty, fearless, and ugly life, and it's sad that people are degrading themselves as Joe's characters in this movie do. What started my most in this movie was that it was from 1969, and he was standing the test of time perfectly. Today's audience will always find great significance in this film and he will still love it and love it as much criticism and audience throughout 1969. The movie was rated X, but what I noticed about this movie is that of sexuality to describe in a more honest, realistic, and effective way. Anyone who had sex before they will know how funny, awkward, and scary as hell he can and this movie does not shy away from any of that. Sex in this movie can not be as graphic as at once thought to be. Movies featuring X rated like MIDNIGHT COWBOY, an ORANGE CLOCKWORK, GREETINGS, The latest Tango in Paris, and the FRITZ CAT all look remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with a rating R today. The sex scene at Midnight COWBOY will look aloud, but they certainly are not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when viewing this movie. The language used in the film, particularly the word "fault" is used effectively and is not free. The violence is very shocking to look even today, but again it is necessary in the sketch to describe the world of a hustler. I'm really pleased to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY does not date and is still just as affected as it was in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope he continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both arrogant and amazing to watch. They have never played roles like this before or since and are completely different from the usual. You will forget who is playing in minutes! <br /> <br /> -Not all of the dates or diaries like many films in this decade come on today as <br /> <br /> -Fantastic and fast editing work <br /> <br /> CONCEPT : <br /> <br /> - For mature audiences only <br /> - The open scenes are well done, but they might just be a little stronger.
