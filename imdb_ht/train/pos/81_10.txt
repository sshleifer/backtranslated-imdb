I watched McCoy's reunion and I was happy to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez ... To see them now was nice, because I was still watching the show growing so when the TV said there was a meeting I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So, I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if anyone outside can tell me what has ever happened Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (my little Luke would be grateful! I was digging everywhere and there was no luck .That 's only I could find out about Michael Winkelman was supposed to be born in 1946. This show was valuable and moral each show has given a lesson to be learned. Today's show can not be .The whole burst was the incredible thing only better than to get out the obout should meet them so far as it is impossible if there is any people can help please thank Glenda
