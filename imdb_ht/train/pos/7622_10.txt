I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so entertaining and terrifying ... So, part 2 of the pilot ... I definitely will keep tuning in this show! This is the real survivor! I watched a few of the other comments I can see that already after just one or two moron episodes here are already crying loudly ... Sorry, if not another reality show, kiddies! There was once a time where there was ... now stir your head! Show current TV! And this one is actually good unlike most of the fancy sitcom today or copies of ump-teenth carbon in a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series are dishing out ... Look at this yourself to form your own Your opinion did not take one of the boneheads here!
