As a matter of fact, this is one of those movies you should give 7.5. The reality is; As already stated, it's a great deal of pleasure. Beautiful Atmospheric. Will definitely come across as on the head, but it's a great car for him, just as Oh, Mr Porter is for Hay. If you like old dark home movies and trains, then this is definitely for you. <br /> Strange enough it's the kind of movie that you'll want to see again and again. It's friendly and good at an endearing sort of way with all the nostalgic references that have made great fare. 'Odd' strips of character simply play in each other as they do in many other British typical seasonal films. It would be wonderful to see this movie if it was recorded by Ealing Studio. A real pity that the original 1931 has not survived intact
