Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a storytelling form, but often it is being compared to Walt Disney. This is just unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's movie that she is the superior artist. She really has a gift in thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride. But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and enchanting! Miyazaki's work never stopped surprising me. Laputa is an adventure in a grand scale and I wonder how a movie can be so packed with details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid kid in a grand adventure of so great and so magical, what would she be like? The answer should embroider your head in some chairs and look Laputa, because it really is a childhood fantasy. Every minute of the film is rich and engrossing ... from the train to chase amazing air-flying sequences ... and the wonderful sight of the castle floating itself. Not to mention excellent notes by Joe Hisaishi! All you have ever wanted out of an adventure movie is here.
