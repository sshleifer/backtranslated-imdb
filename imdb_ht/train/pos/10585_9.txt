Parable parody is among the best of the 1930's comedy extravaganzas. An impressive script and a cast all star including Jimmy Cagney, the beautiful Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler make this movie a cut above the rest. Directly and choreographed by Busby Berkeley's creative genius, this film will have grinning from ear-to-ear from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Busby, of course, is the Context master of the Hollywood music and "Gold Diggers in 1933" and "42nd Street" in his credit (as Director of Dance). The parade parade is honored by hundreds of chorus-bearded-chew girls, a Berkeley trademark. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with one camera and Busby was the first film director to close-ups of the dancers. Her mania and legs have kissed and "behind-seeing" shots that show much of here. The overall effect is very erotic and fascinating. Jimmy Cagney, our boy playing Chester Kent, a producer of "prologue" or short music production productions held in movie theater to entertain the audience before the showcases were shown. It was surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spyware, and a gold-digging girlfriend. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed his dance talent. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney secretary secretary secretary. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. <br /> <br /> The climate film with three exceptional production numbers, "Hotel Bee", the "Waterfall", and "Shanghai Lil", each one a masterpiece and not likely to be copies of Hollywood today The so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Under Claudia's Line: Clever and erotic, and some of the best musical production numbers ever put on seluloid. A quite enjoyable thick depression of era.
