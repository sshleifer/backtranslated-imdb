As plagiarism playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trained in childhood. As it turned out, the role of Moore fit so perfectly, he blocked him as an actor as well. Many deceptions follow soon (including this film movie end), but that does not reduce the charm or appeal of this picture, which is painfully written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes were forced, part of the movie are wobbly, but thrown into iron and many like it is a hard film to resist. He has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly, crazy fun role as Arthur's Valet, Hobson; His relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miracle report. Liza Minnelli (like a blue-collar necklace-like necklace) is sash in a low-key and Moore is bracelet, but nimble and lively; He never shook the shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this document at a high-care career. *** from ****
