This is a movie I've decided to go and see because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a movie does not evolve around a popular actress or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the movie to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of actor's ability to different styles. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly more about style than history. While I found the interesting story (a thriller that lends history and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many animated films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and did not feel like it all came along as well as he could. It definitely has a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese Anime coming together. Whether it's a good thing or not up to the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in this sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or you would like to see a movie that is different from most movies from the moment. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I have enjoyed the movie experience, but it has become a little shameful because it could be best
