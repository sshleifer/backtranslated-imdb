Late a night on a desolate road, in an empty salon Martin Sheen turns a wire for Robert Carradine to Hopalong Cassidy and friends following a group of rustlers murdered creatures, who killed a few men and kidnap the Cassidy girl. <br /> <Writer / Director Christopher Coppola May be the anger of William Boyd purist by daring to make a modern budgetary movie featuring their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad she did it! There is no character to be tied to an actor who has no other people ever allowed to play him or her again! <br /> I think it was good fun with an exciting update of the classic programmers of the thirty and quarantine. Even if guilty of some wrong action, this is serious enough and unpretentious, making it difficult for me to not flu. <br /> <br /> The whole production is somewhat odd though, but I really enjoyed the scene between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are watching a story in a story makes the oddity and more palatable exaggeration.
