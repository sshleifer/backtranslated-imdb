This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen in recent times. Go the way above even any international film of any reputation. I'm really surprised why this has not received the recognition he deserves. Sonali Kulkarni won the National Award is perhaps only the reality of consolation. Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes in her eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: When Gauri comes back from the city on Krishna's marriage, he and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna noticed a change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialogue said. The entire gamut of thrills is targeted at subtle styling and eyes. There's another at the end when Krishna pleaded Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you do not move around this stage, you do not have a heart. <br /> Watch this movie for bright film-made shine and ability to act.
