This is indeed a treat for every Bolan fan, some may think that it's a little over the head, and that it is only about the ego Ringo and Marc, but I think it's the same as any other concert video , except for the fact that this is Marc bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for children in the revolution, and Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip alone is worth every money, I can not believe they didnot released this version as the sole. The film is really superb, especially for our teeth. Now I did not live for 70 years. but danes in general have totally shot from what happened around them. The media did not play or show any of the popular music back then including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a little with the doors, only the songs really popular though. So, I know from my father, who sees this, give him a part of his youth, he never experienced. <br /> I do not do this too long, so ... If you're fond of the least bit of Marc Bolan, you need to see that. you might find it boring or as said before, a little over the head. But at least you've seen one of the best singles ever, in action! <br /> Only things that disappear me a little, is that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but I forgive him, since jeepster and get it on them, so nice to play.
