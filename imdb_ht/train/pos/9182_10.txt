People love Jane Eyre's book as I do (it's my favorite time, and I'm reading it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a tad too good to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does a wonderful job showing the brooding master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke could be just a little too old to play 18 years old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the ages of the characters. The dialogue of the film is taken almost as a result of the book, which was very clever. Sure, this movie might look awhile, but it's the only version I've seen including part 3 of the story. <br /> I wish those who made this movie participated in the older version Zeferelli, as it would have helped that mess in a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reef"! It's so versatile that I did not recognize it. She plays Daisy in keeping appearances, and she plays Ms. Musgrove in Persuasion 1995 (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Got DVD to this week, and it's wonderful to see the original version version. There are many more at the start (Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood.) And in the end, they have been restoring many of these things, (I still wonder why St. John had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows Jane is - because the part where it tears out her paintings has been edited from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it ... he's completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I could tell, they have not been edited from Dalton's Timeline, so there's nothing new, but it's great to see the entire ministers in its entirety after all these years to enjoy the VHS . Thanks, the BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a DVD edition special ... and maybe some interviews with the stars ... or a do in show)
