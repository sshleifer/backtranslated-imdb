I was pleasantly surprised to find out how they lost friends and foreigners nowhere near the 'gross-out' comedy as the trailer led me to expect. I quickly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained worthwhile at all. Rhythm of the more visual visual content was, I thought, spot on. (I mean I got the impression I witnessed Pegg's attempts to restore lost control of many 'in real time', so to speak.) At other times it was time allowed to share the main protagonists (ie Pegg and the Dunst) reflection on how events were affected and what led them to where they now found themselves. All the characters were well driven, to some extent interesting in and in themselves, and generally quite likable. (Any noticeable noticeable notice appears to tend to be appeased by a corresponding good residency nativity.) An entertaining, smart scripted, brilliantly directed and superbly acting movie that I would highly recommend.
