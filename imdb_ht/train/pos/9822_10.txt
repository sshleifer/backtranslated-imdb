The first time I saw this movie when I was a ninth-year high school, and the film was stuck with me over the years. It's not on the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue with a bit bad act, it's about education goals, and the message behind which is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you are a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it's a problem. Tons of girls I knew they all have kids now, and I think they never watch this big movie, and if they did, they did not get the message behind it all. It's about not taking luck when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You do not necessarily lose out on your dreams, but must take a backseat in your future because you have a child to reflect on first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind it: Just Say It!
