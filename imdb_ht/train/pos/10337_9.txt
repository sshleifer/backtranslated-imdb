This movie was very funny, I would like to own this for my vintage collection 1970 movie to see again list, I know that the cast of the characters, are those I met over the years and that made me Searching this comedy, unfortunately this has never put DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is still a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a great match as his witty and sassy wife, Norman a son who has a secret not sure whether he will have a future if he is out, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson HOOKER with a heart and little conscience. Love, lust, unusual family link to this movie qualifies for a back performance, comedy situation and a mix of events as it could and should find its way as a remake, I think getting cast might be very difficult maybe impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan role, this earmarks a couple of episodes to Seinfeld who also led me back to Norman is that you, keeping them in the closest, was probably impossible as impossible to reform pretend girl friend hooker and infidelity to a parent. This movie was a wild ride advising in a cabbie, reminded me of Kramer's episode taking the advice of his cadres about his lawyer. (Episode from Seinfeld) Parents have to throw momentum, fun on fun. It's screaming to bring me back.
