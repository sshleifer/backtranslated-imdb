The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in the music and dancing. As I grew older, I became more interested in acting as well. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), he's always fun to watch. The "Badder" section had been left out, though the kids were very good. "Speed ​​demon" and "Let me alone" were funny, especially when the police officer said Michael, "I need your autograph right here," after stopping him for dancing in a non-dancing area. But it's "criminally smooth" this icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). The dance is perfect, and so are the special effects. The only thing I could do without being spiders. Any fan of Michael should see this, if you have not already. I give it a 10+!
