A long time ago, I watched this movie from the middle on cable. I then had a break on Mary Moronov. I saw him again in Food Raoul. I was convinced that she was the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> I may be partial about this movie. 9 from 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I own on the original tape.
