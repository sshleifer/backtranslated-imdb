It was an adorable movie. A real movie feel-good when you need one. The story is light (this is no gone with the wind) but sometimes one needs this kind of draw. Funny and warm character, fantastic acting with beautiful costume / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the ER TV show) is really in this role. It is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. Everything should keep an eye on it, it will be great in the future. <br /> <br /> Also impressive was the band for this movie. A beautiful mix of modern and Indian melodies. I was dancing to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Very recommended if a fun movie is what you need.
