Licensed and lethal ace hit-man Tony Arzenta (a divisive and unmanaged performer by Alain Delon) wants to leave the business assassinated, but the dangerous mobsters he works will not leave him. After killing his wife and child, Arzenta stated open season on all those responsible for their deaths. Director Duccio Tessari relates to the story absorbed at a fast speed, holding a tone of tone and no-nonsense throughout the steps, tearing the shoot-outs and chases of interesting cars and considerable rip-snorting brio, and punctuating narrative and shock crisis in blast blood explosives. Delon suits and charisma attendance add extra classes to the already upgrading procedures. This film further benefits the Sterling act by a bang-up cast, with contributions roused by Richard Conte as wisdom Mafia Kingpin Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as the support of Sandra Donald Arzenta's friend, Marc Porel as loyal Paul Arenza Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as ruthless, calculus Kapon Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as Rocco Cutitta's gangster gangster. Silvano Ippoliti in the cinema has many graceful panes. Gianni Ferrio's end score hit the groovy get-down place. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri pop up shortly in nifty. Better yet, there's no filler to talk in and we even get a decent dowry of delicious female nudity girls. The thrilling conclusion packs a mean and intrusive right wallop in the gut. A solid and satisfying winner.
