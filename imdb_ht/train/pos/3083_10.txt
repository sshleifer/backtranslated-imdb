This deserves a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show needs back, I've seen every episode and this is real quality. <br /> <br /> These centers show around a couple of New Yorkers, playing around with the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly interrupting their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable Caseman. The scenery is amazing and exquisite collection. <br /> We need to show more like this that makes viewers feel like they are smart people by minded drones. <br /> If it's never back, six degrees will be sorely lacking.
