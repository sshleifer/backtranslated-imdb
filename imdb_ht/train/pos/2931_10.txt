Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. When I saw it for the first time about 2 years ago I was in the post for weeks after it. For the date I saw it a further 17 times and I always laugh my ass every time. For those who do not know Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedy stand before he was a Hollywood superstar. There is not one single dull place in this piece of genius unlike Eddie Murphy who was released in 1987 that went flat during the middle. If you do not sort of people who can not stand up then I would not advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing in some form every 5-10 seconds. I gave this a 10 out of 10 because it shows the greatest comic genius of them all at her best.
