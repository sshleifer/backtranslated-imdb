The act is very cheesy, but for those in that area up to the 80s, and now Detroit automotive engineers area, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier to make this movie even more funny. Jay Leno has shown her age last night on the Tonight show! It looks like pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, and the race dragged on the looks of Woodward Ave was great. <br /> <br /> Leno also own some bad car ** now, it would be great to see a remake of this and its modern collection. I'm sure Vette Blown in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> typical 80s movie. Watch it and enjoy. No computer crap products!
