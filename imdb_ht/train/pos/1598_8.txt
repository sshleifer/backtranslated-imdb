Either or, I like the suspension of any trace formula in this movie. I've repeatedly visited it and still holds them. A little too stylized for some but I imagine that any opera guy will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes her enormous luck with her movies and filed it and she almost always pays to movies that are smashed with something delicious, as this one is. I was often amazed at the widespread role of Cher acting, if he chose to minimize that part of his life or he did not get enough good role to play on. I found it to be a superb actress who can retire in a role, as in this particular one or to be loud and daring with the "mask" mask. I found the big comedy strokes at times (a hair salon called "Cinderella") but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays in English rhythm in opera, every morning gesture, at a point asking a knife such as his throat slit. Brooklyn scenes are magic, this is a Brooklyn under moon, romanticized and dramatic, similar to opera. All in all a movie very satisfied by everyone's taste by a long shot, I liked the finish, everyone was brought together as a Greek chorus, every subtle part nuanced and mixed with the others, the camera pulled away from the room , let the speakers speak. 8 out of 10.
