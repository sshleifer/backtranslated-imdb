I rent this movie in the form of DVD without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon in watching a movie every night. After several terrible movie American Action Adventure (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life) Zhu Warrior struck me as the original brilliant movie. The story is complete nonsense, but I've found the movie's sincerity, good-heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Sure, the special effects are not technically as impeccable as that produced by Hollywood, but the wisest filmmakers are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on phishing scarves of rock, a huge moon rising ahead, the image perfectly balanced by three elements. In another, a princess-warrior tore into the sky behind him glowing as a heat-seeking missile. And the colors exploded from the injection shot, used to express emotions rather than representing reality. Characters have the same simplicity and directness of funny book characters, offering great depths of mind, but referring to archtypes that resonate deeply. Physically, several of the actors are surprisingly beautiful. They play their roles straight, without irony or roles, and so is credible. Most strange at all, despite the clauses of draw and thin characterization, I find myself very close to tears, in the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and origin of wildly, heart-hearted to the director . <br /> <br />
