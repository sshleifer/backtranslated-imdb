Just after I saw the movie, the magic feel of the movies Walt Disney came to me and I realized that it was a long time ago that I saw the 'real' magic of a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Very special thing I've seen where the effects are unknown in the movie, started with the Disney logo transformed into the Cinderella castle and ended up as an old fairy tale story with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic has come back to me. I missed this movie 8 out of 10.
