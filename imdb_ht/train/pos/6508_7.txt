I grew up watching Scooby and being a fan forever. This cartoon moves out of the same old routine that can get the boring viewers. Crooks in routine masks gets old and This cartoon is a change in that. It does not mean that to replace the gang of Scooby it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and my writers sure. Focusing on the cartoon is about Scooby and Shaggy who inherited a large sum of money and using these funds to block world conquering plans from a mad scientist and his goon. There are small gangs in the gang and the gang themselves have come from time to time. If you're a fan of Scooby-Doo you can always appreciate the bond between a boy and his dog, and the jokes that come with it. Just enjoy the design and support the creators / writers and producers so that this will not be the latest Scooby design.
