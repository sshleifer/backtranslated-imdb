I was not quite sure if this was just going to make another of those idiotic savanno night operas that seem to clutter the first time but as it turns out, this is a very good show (no small thank-you note talent) . Four female friends and various backgrounds get together and share their weekly-on-love experiences. The long hours program follows each of them separately from the quests often aiming up to finding love and doing it without being boring or trite. Shudi Ti's "Trudi" is the one house (allegedly widowed after September 11th) that gets a little and annoying preachy with his friends (who tend to be a bit heavy and more creative in their initiatives). It's great to see Ti back on t.v., as it was great at the "Lynley Mystery Inspector". The chick can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged, but still very sympathetic of women, as he fights with his style, but self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly at "Spooks") His drive desire has a child, regardless of its needs. The last two members of the cast are Jess's Sweater (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, no specific sex, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) a most popular doctor in dealing with a son AND his father sent his career and love spiral life out of control. That being said, I'm wired now and hope that the BBC continues to break this set out because it's fine, it's different and it's got a big cast.
