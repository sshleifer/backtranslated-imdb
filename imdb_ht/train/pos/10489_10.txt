This clever smart comedy must enjoy for entertainment value. It gets quite hilarious funny at times, but if you have not spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts. <br /> The character thrown out quite well with them quite credible in their role. How Grace occupying her husband's husbandfriend's wedding meeting was well played. It's a true lady. And, my favorite is Grace's white suit that she put. <br /> I highly recommend this flick of anyone who wants to laugh loudly, who cheers for the underdog or just wants to look something different.
