After the usual chasing scene, Jerry accidentally winds up inside an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a series of chemistry. It quickly discovers it is invisible ... So the predictable results occur, meaning it uses the new Tom's hidden tune condition. Jerry often is just to defend himself, but often he has sadistic trials in him who suffers the cat whenever possible, even when unprovoked. <br /> Here, he makes Tom think his eyes are cheating him when cheese comes from a mousetrap missing from his eyes, or letters from a dish. Tom can not take longer for trying to sleep this nightmare off, but Jerry sets fire to his paws! Man, I hope that little kids did not mind watching these drawings back in the '40s and' 50s! I always find Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than beautiful. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, generally, whatever damage a character suffers goes into seconds and goes back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom figure out what the story is with Jerry, and try different methods to detect where the mouse is located (such as putting flour on the floor to see his footsteps).
