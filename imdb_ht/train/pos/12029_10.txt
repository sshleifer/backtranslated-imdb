I love the movie. Twisted Desire was Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I saw most of his movies, but all Jeremy Jordan. The thing I grip on Twisted Desire is when "Nick" gets arrested and her "Jennifer" rats out. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is the Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
