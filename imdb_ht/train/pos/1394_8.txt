I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. I've seen it many times, and I never get tired of it. Strangely enough, every time I watch it lately, it takes me right back in the very first time I saw it. Including this time. Must have this sense of mystery and "What will be about here?" about it. <br /> Oddly enough, one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a great effect on me - Ruth. I think a lot of it was Gerald Fried's note. A real masterpiece, this! The romantic section has been revitalized - much more - in this area of ​​PARADISE. But of course, it debuted here. I found the impression that, from all the Kirk girls knew over the years, it could have been the "sweetest". When she said, "Do you have to go?", Combining with the music, I could really feel the pain she must have felt in could not make her stay with her. <br /> <br /> Someone commented online that Ruth looked more than she was, but she was not supposed to age at all in 15 years. Which makes me think ... Maybe she was one of the academies of the academy. Kirk has an affair with an older woman! (Maybe she thought back to this in "MIRI" when she told Janice, "I never participated in older women." Perhaps it means, "... again." <br /> <br /> Reading ST reviews the other day, I see where someone compares what they little girl did in and I, MUDD. But it looks like her couple should be in there, too .. Which are all those "people "if not android? And can the" caring "be related to the" Old Ones "in the earlier episode? Anyone who he is, it seems to be one of the rare cases in ST locations You have a race that is actually "superior" as opposed to simply thinking. <br /> <br> Yeoman Barrows seems to be filed in for Yeoman Rand ... Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy is to shower about it just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character that appears once and then never shows again! Sheesh. /> <br /> Something missing in the last several I've watched that snuck back in here was, Spock smiled ... he was! I saw him .. I'm I really prefer to know there are two places to h I'm going on inside all the time, rather than this "submerged" business. When he said, "Enjoy yourself, master." Near the beginning, you could see he did not only address his superior officer, but talking to his friends. And in the end, when it's hard to say, "totally logical!", I can not help but think he's doing that peppers to provoke a reaction. She can not smile or laugh, but I think she likes to see her fellow team around her happy.
