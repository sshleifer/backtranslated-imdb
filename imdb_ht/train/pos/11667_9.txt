The secret of Kells is a movie I've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage of the cartoon salon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you right now it's worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylized, but not annoyingly so as I'm scared. The whole movie is something of beauty and great imagination, I particularly like to host the illuminated book where the little faces come to life on the page. The characterization is superb, I like Brendan Gleeson's voice as the Abbot sharply and I especially loved the voice of the Aisling elbow. The forest is a triumph, like a beautiful place. The story is well-known, a mixture of reality and fantasy. and really draws the viewer to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but everyone I know who saw this and not fans of the craft agree that it's a nice little movie. I will definitely buy the DVD when it's released, and would like to say, well-designed Saloon and everyone involved in this mammoth project. There may be many more. :) Come back to here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out of Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world of the Oscars, as a joy to see this nomination.
