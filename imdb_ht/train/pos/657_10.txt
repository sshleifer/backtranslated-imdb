The Maman and Putain must look like a movie that is both related to when it was released (post-68) and eternal in great respect. True, the actors do not "act" ... True, they speak a lot ... But what they say is just what makes life worth living ... or dead. The very long monologue spoken by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that has ever been written about womenhood, manhood and love. Not easy to translate accurately, though. This movie is a statement about the difficulty being a man and woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the major French actors.
