I saw this first movie about 20 years ago and never forgot it. It's very well filmed and the story keeps one riveted forever. It's hard to believe that this was done in 1946, as the story is still cool today, and really makes one think. I'm not very knowledgeable about film techniques however the special effects of this film are terrific considerations then made. In addition, the act is superb, and the use of English actors and Americans quite surprising. I recently bought the DVD now I can watch everytime I want. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.
