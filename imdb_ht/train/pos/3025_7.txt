Bacall does well here - especially considering this is her only 2 films. This one is often overshadowed because it fell between two great successes: "To have and not have" (1944) and "The Great Sleep" (1945), both in his fear and Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not up to par in the other films but I think in no fault of its own. I think there were some miscasting in it showed her a British upper-crust lady. There is no accent too. I think that all the strange accents were distracted - Boyer was certainly no Spanish. It was difficult to keep straight what country they had come from. <br /> I really liked the black and white movies. Mood used great affect - I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intestine and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer just does not fit romantic role in leading men for me - so he and Bacall together were a little weird. Not great chemistry - and certainly no magic Bogie and Bacall. But I still love this picture. There is great tension and it moves well enough. I must say I found the murder of the girl quite fine for this film period. Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorra are standing out as casting support. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely cruel and wrong to paint it. One scene where he laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji leaves after exposing it as the murderer the child is quite disturbing. Lorre also performs well in his slimy, painted hallway in Conteras - a sneaky hunt at the end. Wanda Bendrix also did well in describing the child of Else - especially considering this was her first photo and was only 16 at the time (even though it appears much smaller). Turning out it later married to Auie Murphy who proved to be a live, stormy wedding.
