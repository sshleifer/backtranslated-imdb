Oh, these Italians wavy. It is not the first time to build a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian, but made quite a lot of the early days of movies, especially because they often thought they could get away with it. James M. Cain publisher managed to keep this film in American screen until 1976 but however the film itself has grown a bit of a well-known classic. The film is not as great to watch as the American version 1946 but is a great movie anyway. This of course not to the least is due to the movie it's great storytelling, that's an intriguing one and giving the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel tightly and therefore mostly similar to other movie versions of its history, and of course as a difference that it has set in an Italian setting. <br /> <br /> Let's give it to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people of it. These early drama still have a very realistic feeling about it and are therefore well-meant to look. Unfortunately the movie loses some of its powers toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit over and dragging in. The movie could easily end 15 minutes earlier. But I do not really have much else to say about this movie. It's simply a lot to do, based on some equally large and strong sources. Well, a very impressive director for Luchino Visconti, who continues to direct some of the great and memorable Italian dramatic movies.
