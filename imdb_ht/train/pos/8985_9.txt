Although DiG! was being considered close to what the music industry is like it is very crafty. The director has deceived the audience in believing the Brian Jonestown massacre has disappeared on the face of the post-'98. And the rivalry between Warhols Dandy and Jonestown were letters. The truth of the subject is not really exposed to this film. <br /> <br /> That said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting look as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best things this movie will be for it is a unique perspective between the Indie music scene and the biggest corporate scene. Recommended especially for the music and the fantastic band.
