There's this late show - believe it was 3rd, and the final episode, when it first looked at it - and was blown away by a social one that had not seen on American television since 'everyone in the family'. <br /> It was very surprising that CBS would even run this in the first place. Which is simply saying the last time the CBS had a series' - if you know what I mean - was back to the day of 'everyone in the family'. The most controversial decisions are about to tackle today is how many make-ups are placed on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a bunch of really, really crazy - let them discover truth about themselves. But if you want them to pull strings, call them and find a job in Art Removal - let them discover that truth does not hear their own words spoken in their own mouths. <br /> <br /> As Aardman has always been THE Way to the Curve. And this show is no different. Somehow he snaps under the social / social / political censor / censor policy to find him on the schedule (maybe 'big bronze' never really looked it until it finally revealed?), But once the 'middle' merika heard and seeing themselves that they themselves - well, can bet the field that message, or the messenger, will not last long .. <br /> Now if only the missing bands can find their way on Usenet or bit- torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
