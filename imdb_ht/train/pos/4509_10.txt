Arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESCIMO hunter. <br /> <br /> S. Van Dyke, MGM's peripathetic director, was responsible for looking fascinating in life in the Arctic in the middle of the Inuit. His production was about to dune from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some effects adversely affect the projection show that some of the shooting took place back to the studio). While being considered a documentary at the time, we would likely term it a 'docudrama' as it scripted with an intriguing scheme & storyline. The movie shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both winter & summer, and in fact begins in the warmer weather of the year without any snow or ice in sight. The constant supply of food is shown, and the viewer gets to look at the interesting hunters for walrus, polar bears, candles & caribou. The native language is used throughout, using the title card; The Englishman only speaks by the fishermen & Mounties meet by the Eskimo. In fact, it is the arrival of White Men, both good and bad, and the change they make about Eskimo society, which is an important element in the narrative. frankly frank ways with the Moroccan moral code, particularly with the practice of sharing the wife, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the film can all be appreciated as an important look at a life-style that quickly disappeared even in the early 1930's. None <br /> <br /> <br /> None of the cast receive credit screens, which is a shame as there are some remarkable performances. The first among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of the Mala Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaska Native American ancestor and is absolutely splendid and perfectly credible to what was a very demanding part. As beautiful as any Hollywood star, she would continue to act, using the name of Ray Mala, to a sporadic film career, often in the unbilled role. <br /> <br /> Lovely Japanese-Hawaiian Lotus Long Playing the second loyal Mala's wife; The names of the fine actress play other spouses are now dark. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector. The two decent-hearted hills who must deliver Mala Justice Canadians are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing, both actors of long film films. Danish author Peter Freuchen, on whose film book was based, has a shining role in a bad Captain's wooden-legged captain who unjustly writes the frustrated Ice Island.
