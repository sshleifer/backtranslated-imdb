This movie is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. He captures the audience imagination and his role in David Aames. Her character can relate to us all in some ways.The storyline is very clever and keeps the audience on the edge of the whole movie. I never really watch the Cruise Cinema much before, but after seeing this it shows me her true talent. My favorite part of the film is at the end of it all come to a great conclusion and find the truth. If you have not seen this again you definitely should give it a try. It's one of those films that once you started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should just go buy it and take a risk what I did and it became one of my favorite films of all time. It's a 10/10 * I promise once you look at it, it will stick to you, and you'll love it forever.
