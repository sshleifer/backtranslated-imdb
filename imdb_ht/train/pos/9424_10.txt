For me this is the most filmed Ealing Studio - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released. As a satire on the economic notion of 'growth' and the commercial need for in-build obsolescence, it might have been more up-to-the-minute. And in what other movie can it be said that the hero literally placed on the field? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallel with Jurassic Park, in which mercy and environment will literally turn round and bite you. But Spielberg was torn away from the central central central laryard to read about some 'nonsense' nonsense. Hmmm. <br /> In The Man Of The White Costume, Alec Guiness plays an idealist young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never puts out. Workers and capitals in the English north of England where they work are united as never before in their livelihood coverage. <br /> <br /> Of course, being frozen, it's a comedy, but it does not need to be. The complex interview of investing (should be adapted?) Interest plays out well, as one by one, all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat, and that dispensability and waste are what keeps the woven trunks. /> But yes, this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid political irons are delicious performances, and some good old-fashioned hit - over laughter. However, it's the biting satire that persists - dazzling and white.
