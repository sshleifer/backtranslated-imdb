This movie resembles many 'enemies of the State' with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we have an innocent man (black) being pursued by the 'government' and all modern technology known to people. Usually when scenarios are copied as this result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course I like everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there was more good thing about this movie then. The main Baddy, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, with the sinking story and excellent excerpts such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was however disappointing most of the party. It is so out of place, split bad jokes, conjuring up no sympathy to the audience. Or do not start with, the strange thing is that it somehow grows over you (and its followers as well!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but was amazed with a good movie action firm and comedy bits. 7/10
