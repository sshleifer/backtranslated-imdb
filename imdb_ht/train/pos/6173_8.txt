A great movie. The act - from the doctor to the pavement artist at the whore's head, and some exceptions, was wonderful; I thought soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the youngest actors known. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who can accuse of overacting, presents a credible and familiar character. Another great thing was the camera work - and the way he captured the energy of bombay street, the tranquility of purgatory saying his prayers and life in the small apartments. <br /> I love the story of the wall that becomes a chapel and then gets crushed - and the philosophical artists take on it. <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian terms.
