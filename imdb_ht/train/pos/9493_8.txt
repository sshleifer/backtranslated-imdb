White Fire was a lot to go for it. With Larry Bird look-alike Robert Ginty who leads the charge blazing away with her fabulous hair and super whiskers, the movie rises above other low-budget shareholders. Charisma of having at this make Tom Selleck look like a PÃ¼tz. With Ginty beating up everyone, the movie only woke up awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue came into play. Then add to Fred Williamson, there are some front bushes, chain assignments and some awesome incendiary terms .... flicking this movie ends up delivering on all cylinders. If you are looking for some pair B-Action, this is where it's in. Now, if I can just get my hands on that band.
