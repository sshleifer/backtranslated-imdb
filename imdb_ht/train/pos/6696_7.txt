when I first began to look at it became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan Hart is very funny and talented so the aunts and the characters and the other star of the Salem show the cat, it was extremely funny. The first few season of my opinion was the best where Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapted to witch's life. They were much nervous, more fun and more ... good. I'm not a fan of when they started to introduce Brad and Dreamer to cause I really love Valerie, but they were okay the issue they were only in it for a season. if you're going to have new people at least keep them. I did not like Josh it was a t * t, I preferred Harvey but then he disappeared. and got rid of Libby! It would be awesome if you were tinkering in theses seven years. and Mr. Craft as well, if he and Zelda were married who would have gold! Then Sabrina moved from her aunt home to Roxie / Miles / Morgan home. I did not like those theses either, he did not really seem to have loved Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charms and things and aunts seemed to be shunned out of her life and of her own stupid story line. I kind of stopped watching her for a while and the old re-running was back and I was like whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say that the last few seasons were absolutely terib.they got rid of the aunts that sucked out that they were a big part of the show. Then suddenly it allows these two freeloaders to move around to the beautiful home when treated like dirt. and now she's working in some store stores for starring star celebrity guests at the show, if they're in every episode it's kind of crushing it. The program just really went down and lost its glamor. I saw the last episode. she had her aunt (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she's got married but she runs with Harvey in the end. I would like to know what happened next. Well as my review with the only thing I can say is the only thing that has been left to appeal to herself in the seven years was the Salem Cat.
