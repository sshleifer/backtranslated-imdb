This is one of the movies I've ever seen more beautiful. The footage is extraordinary, fascinating at times. He also got an Oscar for best photography, and deserve it. I have many movies in my movie collection and several more I've seen besides, and not many of them are the most beautiful or even equally as beautifully shot as this one. <br /> It's unique with a great big movie. Throw is terrific and does a good job of portraying the characters. We follow the destiny and devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn about ourselves and our lives. I think so much of this film for what it represents, and how it presents it. I warmly recommend it
