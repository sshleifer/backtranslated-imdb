This is almost typical Lynch. However, what makes this movie a bit strange for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateur. But I believe Lynch does so on purpose to provide a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of the surreal moment. <br /> However, a lot of typical Lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; ante music; long (debwaz) poz; hanging curtains; Darker dim is darker in a fast (almost indivisible) slowing; extreme lock ups; term of women in issue; Over-wear, incompatibilities, all characters know face off and disarmed characters, temporarily subconscious, in the dark and so on ... their performance is great and the brief is thought provoking. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered and this swells the imagination. Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I only hope to make some shorts, plus the lines of its sony playstation 2 ads. They were inspired.
