I really really like this show! I always liked to show the 1990's in Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why the Adult Network Network Network Network would take such a funny show like this in the air. I hope to put this show on DVD or something. The show is on the tart (from the Cartoon Space cartoons, SGCC and planet design) that lives his everyday life with his mother and father and his best friend who loves to drop in a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were one of where Zorak gets this really good song and then his voice does not give him any money that Zorak has made from singing at all. Another episode I love is the one where Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework and then returned from Sunday through Friday and just junk off and then returned to the duty day to invent and then , when they returned to homework did not exist! Another episode I love is one of Brak's father's and next neighborhoods, the Thundercleese Robot holds getting into this argument and then finds food in a giant worm. Another episode I liked was one of Zorak's places to stand up intimidated and then some new guys took on his stand. I also love a lot of other episodes! One of the things that never failed to make me laugh is when Zorak gets beaten, dried and zapped!
