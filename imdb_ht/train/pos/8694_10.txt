It was in 1988, when I saw "Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Australian TV). At that time, I was already a very great Spitting Fan fan (since she was raised brass at the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded every show on tapes and watched it again and again - especially the "Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie was standing in front of a painting by Abraham Lincoln (thinking of being a mirror), saying in his head "I need a peel." Or most fun at all, when he plays ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> It's such a shame, that spitting images seems to fall in oblivion; It was one of the most fantastic and smartest ever-made television ever. Compared with other satirical emissions, it was definitely the best of all. <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
