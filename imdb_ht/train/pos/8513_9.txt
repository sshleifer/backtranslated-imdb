I always had the philosophy that every single person had different tastes, I found this movie to be awesome and I think every college student out there might agree with me. Although this is not a "film and a draw", it's about real men and some of the "issues" that they face. I found the hilarious movie (especially the parts that they played jokes are practicing on each other). Simply put, if you are in the same "wave-length" as these people, you will find this amazing movie. I do not think this will win any Golden Globe or Oscars, or that people in this movie will become Hollywood's future star, but it's a kind of "kil-classical" among young people who might relate to their experiences . For me the guy who stands out most is Hans: The Scandinavian guy, who, according to him "is not a looker", but gets all (or some) of the chicks. The "little ones" also play a major part of the film, especially when they drink. If I continue to go, I might give a spoiler and I do not want to do that, just go and get the movie and you will not regret. I give it a 8/10
