What a real treat and quite unexpected. This is a real thriller movie is all about. I ran into the video shop, grabbed a movie without reading the whole blob on the back and hoping for the best. I was totally surprised and happy. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all had a great performance and made the characters realistic. The plot was thought out, well written and directed. It kept you interested in starting to finish and never got bored for a single minute. I highly recommend this movie to people who like stairs, especially well-trained thrillers and those who keep your attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 from me.
