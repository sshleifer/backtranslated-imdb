I did not know what to do in this movie. I guess it's all about it really. I never saw a movie like it and I doubt that I'm really ever again. Glover puts together something unique in it. I think they appreciate it you have read some of his poetry, perhaps seeing one of his slip shows. I really like this guy, it's just so scarier I can not help her. Note: I saw this movie before it was in its final correction, so maybe what I've seen and what others have seen are different. I'll know, I guess, if I choose to see the movie again. I think I'll have to be quite drug influencing ...
