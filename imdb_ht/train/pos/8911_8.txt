I've seen the Blob several times and is one of the best foreign budgeting movies from the 1950s. An unusual outer shower just outside a small town and a senior man goes to investigate this. A strange jelly like substance then attached himself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land reached in time and took it to the local physician, where the old man then , becoming fully absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass becomes bigger. When these incidents report to the police, they do not believe the young couple and accused them of doing all this. They finally believe when the mass, now big turn up the city cinema and everyone runs through the streets screaming. He then attaches himself to a diner with the young couple and some others inside. The blob stops not spraying a charge of fire extinguisher in it and frozen, which is its weakness. It is then transported by the frozen wastes in the Arctic and disposed of there. But it is only frozen, does not die ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical environment for its periods: adolescents and a small town. The pate has a good rock and style style style at the beginning and the film is atmospheric at all. End, beware! The Blob was followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of these blob films. <br /> The cast is lead by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut playing his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. The pate is a must see for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
