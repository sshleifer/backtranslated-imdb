You better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it any later, you'll be confused as it happens in Clark's life. <br /> But that's the twist; Clark is stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex loses most of his feet and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge crash when he swerved to miss Clark in the pilot of the series. Married to Lionel. Regarding the constant is the single most loyal friend of Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, it does not have any power. He is in a mental institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has power, and it is ridiculous to believe that. Aside from Chloe, there is a mysterious figure in Clark: a black man in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution, who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain true to what he believes is actual reality, and he does not get brain in the institution's psychiatrist, who is in fact the fourth Phantom Zone escapee. <br /> This episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking. Plus, it provides a cool twist from the usual type of episode "Smallville".
