Photography this budget bid production is amazingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has many 80ish look at it. Directions and editing are often well-inspired with television-movie like, too. * And * the first movie only seems to want to view its viewer's turtles and lurid images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's notes are also a typically simple and bold work of this tablet, untalented composer. But if you want to watch the movie you're rewarding with a very moving family history, a sort of European family version Edna Ferber's family is giant. While at first you wonder why Clara married this exotic man, even his character gets more in depth and more one background can be judged by. Clara delivers the spiritual lesson film, a great statement and moves to the terrible things of her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands that lesson and finally tries to live by her. The drawings were constructed and the end of mirroring at the beginning was great. The actors all do a great job, too. I asked "Who is the actress playing Blanca?" all the time, but of course, it was a really young Winona Ryder! <br /> At all, this film really makes me want to read the book.
