A girl in distress is a pleasure because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific support cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> Typically funny comedy for an Asta movie was her as an American dance star in England and Burns as her publisher and his secretary Allen. They examine a story about being a love bug and women dropped his left and right victim. He runs to Fontaine who has been taken prisoner in his castle by a late aunt with his docile father. Draw funny. <br /> <br /> The big songs include a Foggy Day, things are looking up, Nice work if you can find it, and I can not be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing but make a short (and decent) number and Astaire. Amazingly good at a few dance numbers and the Astaire Burns and Allen, including a hearty and fun hobby at an amusement park. Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - John Duggan as the lead guitar singer. John Duggan is among the swoony trio that sings Nice Work if you can find it. Its facial expressions are hilarious. It was also a stage stealer in the W.C. Field comedy, the old fashioned way, plays Pepperday Cleopatra. <br /> <br /> There are many abuses that have been hosted on this movie because of the absence of Rogers genera, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been miscast. The TCM hosted terms considered Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews. Yikes. Two more would be disasters. Fontaine is good as Alyce and the dynamics allow the musical numbers to be part of Astaire, with enough comforts to rescue by Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good cast, and John Duggan in a bold spotlight!
