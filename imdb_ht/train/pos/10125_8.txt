This film is the first of the trio of the MiZi society, and trilogy kicks off at a great start. Movies in the trilogy are only connected thermal, and these terms are actually apparent in all its films, if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid's brother from getting involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, fighting the roads to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The kid's fee is a lawyer, and gangs of triads are becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very difficult environment, and is therefore very violent and difficult. Miike has done much worse, but since this is a serious movie she hit you very hard. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, especially homosexuals in this one. The film is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive with true grittiness. If you saw only Miikes far from the movie (Ichi Assassin, Fudoh etc.) this is worth checking out since it's sort of a compromise between his aggressive style over-the-top looks at these movies and his more serious side ', as seen in the other film of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes that you will NEVER forget (see it and figure out what for yourself). <br /> 8/10
