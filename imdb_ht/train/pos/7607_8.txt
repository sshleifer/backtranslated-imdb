It's not quite injected, well written or well-acting but it has to be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Pics. Each single revelation is timed well that you have to see the next episode to find any kind of closure. They even slowed down the pace in the show where they only reveal the small amount of information every episode however it feels like they just told you all you wanted to know. However some of the act is just about awful and some of the Duologue is downright brutal. Some characters are two-dimensional. Experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out on actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the episode below can not show what the previous episode leads up to. Side-by-side considerations have become part of the story that sometimes tells you nothing. However, the second season was developed at a point where history came back to reveal more of the island than they were. All of its a great show, but not perfect.
