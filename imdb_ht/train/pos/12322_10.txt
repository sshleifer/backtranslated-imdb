This movie is one of my favorites. It's a genre mix and ingredient in Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedy genre. Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared with modern standards. This minor defect is easily ignored. There are many things to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts me. Visuals are beautiful too. The bigger action is no surprise, it is from Honkong, where he is born in the world's best film action. The humor sometimes seems a little funny but in a great way. Somehow this movie is that they could balance the different humor and keep them good. Absolutely recommended.
