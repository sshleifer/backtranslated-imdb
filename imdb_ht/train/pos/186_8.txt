There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, provide the property rights; It is wonderful in funny roles. William Haines was able to act, and you can see why he was one of the most popular popular folk screen. (Up to a potential scandal forcing him out of the business). <br /> The story is a bit saddened but handled so beautiful that you have not noticed. King Vidor's leadership is one of the main reasons for this. The Producer? Engineering the boy, Irving Thalberg. It's about to make movies, and you get to see the process as it did in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors directors and actors emot. You get to see (shortly) some of the big stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin makes a turn like himself, seeking an autograph. Also, you will see clearly in Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who are not the only ones with old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, take the time to catch this movie when you can. It's really a terrific journey back in time.
