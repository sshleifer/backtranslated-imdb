The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. Correct is good; The film is well-paced. The direction is competent and assured. The story is plodding. The film averagely acts by Ledger, Bloom, and Watts virtually great and rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're out in the US for just sitting back and enjoying the landscape (or as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film I'm neither bored nor moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I said, I did not care at this point. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom type, sort of showing some suggestions in the range (although often-present "my beautiful and confused" look is important), so fangirls can get it worth the matinee cost. Other than that, just do not see it. It's neither good nor bad enough to be fun.
