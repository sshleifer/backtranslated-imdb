First of all I'm a butcher, straight white male. But even with that disability I like this movie. It's real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing in New York in the eighties and one thing about them I still admired their courage to live their lives in the way they wanted to live. No matter what the consequences are. This is courageous. You must admire that. This is a great movie, watch it and take in what she likes to be a flamboyant African American or Spanish Gay Men in New York in the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line of real life.
