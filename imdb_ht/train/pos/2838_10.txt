New York I love you is full of love and power. Not for everyone, however, but a beautiful movie. She has the love of Shia LaBeouf (seen from Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, My Robots, Indiana Jones, and many more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, and many more. With a star-studded cast, this movie without a doubt, brilliant. From many top-notch directors around the world, it does not fail to impress. The diversity from one story to another is creative and unique. It's safe to say that my New York love you are a popcorn movie, and should look on a BIG TV! This time, trust the IMDb Rating, because it is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Look at Shanghai, I love you in 2010. <br /> <br /> Look at NY Ily, you will not be disappointed.
