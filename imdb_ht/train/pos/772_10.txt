Love is overwhelming ... All of it's manifestations ... Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one truly dramatic story about love in all of it's form, a story about how to inadvertently Youth hearts, life and innocence are all led by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a magnificent band featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the tastes back to love misunderstanding ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or is Romanian cinema slowly but surely advanced and respected? This is a brilliant film ... Two thumbs up to everyone involved.
