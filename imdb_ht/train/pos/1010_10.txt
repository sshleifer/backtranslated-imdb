I love this show! Whenever I watch an episode I repeat this line and remind myself how good at this show is. I'm a big fan of sci-fi and this show is right to be the most important science (fiction?) Show in the story of film / tv. There are many theories in this show about the universe I could start a religion. Its amazing, season-after-season show is getting better and better. <br /> I was a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 now) and I found it to be ironic that I love 2 TV shows in all of the time of Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> Back when I first saw the Stargate movie, I immediately liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, then heard a TV show would turn out I was really excited, but did not get showtime until the fifth season was almost over. But I was astonished that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a trilogy in the movie but the studio options series instead. <br /> <br /> Id said though it turned out just fine. Maybe even better. <br /> This show is amazing, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis here we come!
