I just accidentally stumbled on this movie on one day TV. It was revealed in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for oning good movies. This one, however, was nothing less then good. October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launcher to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends are starting to build rockets. His father is not happy about his son found new pleasure and would rather see him become a minor coal as himself or going to college on a soccer-like brotherhood. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. Somewhat too predictable maybe, but this OK causes it not to focus too much on the parts of the story. It is important to party, but this is obviously the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clich√©s, but that's OK. It is based on the current event so you can not just go down these clicks. The characters are really good. Where the story is about a downhill the characters are carried out and managed to keep the action and the quality of the high film. You get to know these characters and get empathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> This is a good looking movie. The compositions and style 50 are good and the pictures are well-compact and well-lit. That's all the attitude of the movie is very good. <br /> <br /> The act is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast are also good. All this set makes out a very strong cast. <br /> All in all I'm glad I keep this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on current events. If I knew that when viewed, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and exciting movie. It is a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feel-good movie. Not bad at all!
