Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is easy to find distribution of festivals outside film West. Why? Can you sensitive to the sale of a movie where police offenders raped men and girls suspected of getting talk (and the victims enjoy it) or seeing an old lady having his eyes torn from his skull? These are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story. It made Orange mechanism that was prohibited for years in the UK to look like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie? YES It is fantastic and essential for fans of Asian movies. The shocking moments have to illustrate what goes on in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you catch Dead or Alive who is very similar (preventing the crazy end of the course DOA). Great for Japan to have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this movie outside a retrospective Takashi Miike at a movie festival is on DVD. If I did not put you in trying to hunt for a Hong Kong version on the Internet as I'm sure it will come out of this country.
