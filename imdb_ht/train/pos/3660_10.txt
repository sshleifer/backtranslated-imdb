This darkness of Sica delivers the merchandise. And said, "Parties will inherit the earth." This story of class on the surface but really a allegory for all homeless people who populate Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but happy, in a very poor and selfish society of care or recognition, footmats for Italian carpets. Two secrets choose to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I do not read the book it is based on so I can not predict if the ancient deus machina is constructed by the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, "Once upon a time ..." in the exemplified timelessness of its history, so the story could be placed anywhere and everywhere. Cartoon cartoon of the aristocracy that cuts off the bone, fantasy nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and a finishing right from a picture Spielberg to make this cocktail a pleasure for everyone. Sika's most accessible photo is also one of her best. Abandon neo-realism, he still dallied between that with good old movie-making, creating a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time full of it and the desire of the hope that a person needs to continue in this world a. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
