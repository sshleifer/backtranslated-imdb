Say a movie that is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I very much want to watch a depressive film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one. It is often the heart of a Chinese man and his family as they experience many years in both difficulties and many. But I must warn you that this would be just about the most depressing films from Hollywood in the 1930s - because the peasant life in China TOUCH said the least. Prepare to look for hunger, death and illness segment. <br /> On the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead was played by Paul Muni. While it was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that Hollywood still drives people from European descent to play Asian drives during this era. If you're paying attention to all, it's very clear that Muni is wrong for the party.
