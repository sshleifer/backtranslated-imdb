Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie movie in late 90's I was ecstatic! This is the best and most comprehensive version of the book on film! This version is temporary to sit in one but well worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was pleased to have cast a normal actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a celebrity person. I love together with places. For anyone who is a fan of Jane Eyre fans, this is the version to look !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost break so I was thrilled to get it on DVD.
