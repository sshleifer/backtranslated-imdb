To be fair, I hope to chases cars in this movie. There was only really one, but apart from that, 'freeway' was a great movie that I am glad to own on DVD. The only really great names in the cast are the Richard Belzer Homicide as the Radio Psychiatrists and B-films by excellence Billy Drago as the Apocalypse-quoting Freeway killer. But the rest of the cast generally provides good performance. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a bit of bowel. He could be a victim of discouraging character but it is completely rounded as it seeks out Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid, coming across as rather wild, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well styled out save for a Sunny back story given by officers his ex. The tone of threats kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere at the LA Highway at night with the prowling killer 'the length of his gray disaster sedan is an excellent way of building tension, and the music used to underline film It is decently composed. I do not know why some people hate this movie. Different caches for different genres, I suppose. But I absolutely loved 'highway' and I can recommend it.
