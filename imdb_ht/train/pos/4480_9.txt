In the Movie Cinema Movie Series film of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin in a music. I'm sure you can do better than that. She is such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do too seriously with this either. Louis B. Mayer has lent Gene Kelly from Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration left Kelly choreographing his own number, and because he, Cover Girls became a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control. When Aweigh Anchors finished, Fred Astaire at last had a rival dance to Monaco in Cinema Dance. <br /> <br /> The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with mouse Jerry. Originally Kelly wanted to make the number with Walt Disney's mouse, but Disney did not lend Mickey out of anyone. Mickey would have to wait until Roger raced to make a movie out. Do not worry because MGM has its own animated rodent half-team Tom and Jerry. Kelly as a dancer always strived to do something new and different on such screens as did Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, these two have allowed all kinds of artistic controls and were praised for their work even if the films themselves were not up to snuff. It was like each inspiring the greatest and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit. In fact, Frank Sinatra still gives credit to Gene Kelly to show her how the musicals should do as she gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning her as Oscar for from here forever. When Frank Sinatra had half the contract he had bought at RKO by MGM he insisted on a little creativity on his own. He would become a friend of the composition team at Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insists that he writes his song for this movie. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers from Anchors Aweigh, I fell in love too easily. Frank sings she accompanied herself on the piano in a blank Hollywood Bowl. It's sinatra at her best. <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn rich has earned the title of putting more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than anyone else. They were friends of all life and Cahn still credited Sinatra and reinforced the stage in his career. On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale. They proved to be in Anchors Aighigh when Kathryn Grayson put his soprano to work on all of my heart sung songs. It also has some classic numbers. <br /> Here's the song in fact is the base on the field. Sailors on leave in a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and his sword ladder Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix it up with Sinatra, Kelly says she can find her an audition with Jose Iturbi. They pass the film trying to accomplish just that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! She has received review reviews of her performance as Meg Brockie at Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I have a suspicion he had a number that was cut and somewhere in the MGM cell he could still. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just did not make any more. All creative talent was under the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deal. If you had to pay market value for it, the cost could retrieve some third country debt in the world. <br /> But the film results would be extraordinary.
