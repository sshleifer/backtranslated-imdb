I first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night TV. The Hell of Hell is from me. But then, I was a teenager back in those days, not as jaded about film as I am now. CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the genre of Italian horror, baby killing) (1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing, then check out those too. I also miss those with these Poe films earlier than Roger Corman did during the same period. <br /> I saw the new Sinaps DVD taken from a French print and it's a great improvement on that old and screened pan that made the TV journals over the years. It adds a couple of minutes of dialogue (in French) that does not really add much to the movie as a whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cutting. Unfortunately, the DVD does not really offer any additional expenses in the movie. <br /> One steam I noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effect man of the next camera being reflected on the mirror at the front of the altar. I guess the editors did not catch it at the moment, or maybe they did not care, but it was something I did not notice the first time. That's wonderful in DVD. You get to see all the flubs, errors and details that did not appear the first time around. But no problem. <br /> But no matter, it always gets a 7 on the meter of IMDb <br /> <br />
