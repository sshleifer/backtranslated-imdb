I saw ZP when she first released and found it a great disappointment. The script he seemed forced with arch and too fakey '60s. It's too politically upsetting and ridiculous. And let's face it, I've always been under a spell-like love like BLOWUP: and I still have not completely shaken it. Now the "love" twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia he recalls and, well. . . Good luck to me! <br /> But time and time were good for ZP and time was a teacher to me. I reviewed this movie about every ten years and it just gets better and better and age. And ZP is her own "experience" and is only really linked to BLOWUP to its creator, late, the great sir Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had great fortune to see an absolutely primitive printing, projected in its correct size (immense), restored by a Italian cultural agency that knows a great job of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping something in beauty in good shape. At that day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot in Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand flying Antonioni shocks intended to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from this point is a totally different sort of "place". <br /> <br /> What amazing for me is how this movie will come to its own. <br /> I remember the second around to see it --- the 80s early --- I started feeling affection towards the movie as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. While, before these two seemed to be a smart-alecky shadow version of Olivia and Leonard Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet) are now engaged to me-particularly the girl in his insistence-slapping -ality. It-take-it-time. . . Viv. Everything, everything dies around it. <br /> <br /> Being interesting to the daylight theater in fact quickly began to erase my new find "enjoyment". An embraced-hearted ancestor, great 80s haired whispered "But this is a hippie fantasy --- let it go" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'The first time around so I answer "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and watch my "love" secretly, visually and jealous. , and, if you want it to have its way with "love" you come back: secretly, jealous, and poseman. And you get "changed". <br /> <br /> It was thrilling to see Turner Classic Movies have decided to show ZP in its mass programming. Undoubtedly, ZP must be viewing on a gigantic screen so it can really take you to its built environment. But hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all. Today's hit fact, ZP has been removed mysteriously and replaced with antique bride in the restaurant ALICE .. So it's still too "tough", also "disturbing", also "what"? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's that, as with all good art, she lives while everything is dying around her. <br /> <br /> Peace.
