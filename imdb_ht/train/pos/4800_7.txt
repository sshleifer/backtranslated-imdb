I went to the story straight to a sad sad / cheerful style with beautiful direction and some good acting. These I got. What I did not expect was an aggrandizing of the trials of human existence. Let Lynch take a simple story about a 300-mile trip on a lawn and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. If you did not notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meet, the arena he drove in, the people who gave him the kind of discussion he has (one of the first is on pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particularly haunting in this context, as it is normal with his fear and jumping hills. The latest mechanical failure can be seen as a death, and regenerates the engine of its engine relating to a future, in which it achieves the desired reunion. <br /> I only hope some of the people who mark this as a slow steam melodram take the time to look with a more holistic attention.
