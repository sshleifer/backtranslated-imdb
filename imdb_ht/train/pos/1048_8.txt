For Muslim women in western Africa, married life from abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community can not teach this behavior, but equally, it may not be ready to see it as a criminal, an attitude of course allowing it to proceed. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroonian government promises equality for all, and this documentary follows real-life explanations of various women practices in the Cameroonian legal system as they seek to safeguard justice for a number of women and children. What is remarkable (apart from the central uprising story) is how, in spite of their informalities, the courts are actually progressive pragmatic, if a case is actually bought. The program also provides a fascinating insight into the life-style of Cameroon, which (aside the terrible crime committed in the case cases) looks amazingly emotionally and joyfully compared to what was enjoyed by people in Europe or North America. And while I'm convinced that this comment may be neglected on my part, this attitude appears to be captured in delightful Pidgin-English to speak. In general, this is a little movie movie, and many more fun to look than you might imagine.
