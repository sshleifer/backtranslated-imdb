Everything is idyllic in suburbia when the family little moved into, as the father had a new job at a computer company there. But no paradise should be completed without its snake. Strange things happening as a family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly keeps secret. The father is not a manager, but pressure is on him to join, as everyone is nothing in the neighborhood and in their work are members. Part of good guy Robert Urich is a little bit tired, but Joanna Cassidy as a good natured housewife sizzles nasty. Stop and make chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club president. Watch out for Michael Berryman's favorite cult in a small part as a swallow. The film captures the sense of paranoia and the final special effects are worth waiting for. I saw this movie quite a few times.
