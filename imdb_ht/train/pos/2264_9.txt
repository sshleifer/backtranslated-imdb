Vonnegut's words are best paperwork. The accounts read the gossemar trams, slogans of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of explosions Marilyn Manson or Jerry Bruckheimer. His words were treated well once before, in the remarkable slaughter-5. <br /> <br /> Mother night is probably one of the three Vonnegut novels written I could take in a desert island, along with slaughter-5 and Bluebeard. The movie version deserves a 10, but the books are forever part of my inner landscape that I just can not do it ... some of the scenes left out of the movie are part of my memory.
