Perhaps some people can consider this a slow movie. However, it's precisely this "slow down" allowing it to profoundly affect the viewer. Like that wonderful scene first: first, we can hear the voices; Then we may see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly clogs back and on the side and we see another character, a young man who just sits there, apparently does not even listen to the conversation or, at least, does not really care. The fact that this young man will be the role of the leading movie show model: allowing the character to develop and to be determined by the surrounding environment, but without notice the points more than necessary. People come and go, sink in and out of his life. Although most of the movie follows it (and most of the characters supported, only seeing when closing it, defined according to the relationship caught up with it), we are induced to believe that we were objective, so Subtle is the director touch.
