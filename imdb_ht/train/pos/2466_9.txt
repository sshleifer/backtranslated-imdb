I have never seen four hours happily so quickly as I watched this film. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet that it always means to have. Even those oh-talk people are so popular to do in new ways and to invent. And the cast is incredible, the Brannagh star shines. It is charismatic, power and order in the role that defines the film. Make it a full version full of many holes and allow for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where somebody would expect the darkness, gloomy cliche, we are treated to a great reception for the eyes. The only encounter comes from Hamlet itself, as it should. Well worth your time, all four hours in it.
