Just returned from the first show at Basic Instinct 2. I went on to think it would be crappy-based preview review and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct I think you will enjoy # 2 though much if not more. Big stories that always keep you asking and thinking. The music is superb, repeating the original theme. Do not go to the Academic Awards Award, go to see it for fun and fun. That's what movies are designed for - escapism. I can not think of a better way to save than to save Sharon Stone who is sexy as she ever did. I think about going to see it again this weekend. Go see it!
