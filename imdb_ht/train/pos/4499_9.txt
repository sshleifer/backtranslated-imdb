This exciting story of enthusiasm love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVDs after its PBS broadcast, with a higher picture and sound crisper. My only reserve is that the plot has an unpleasant moment and that some of the Manchester accents most are difficult at times. Likely to even miss a word here and there will not spoil the fun: the main actors are ideally disposed. Robson Green carries an enigmatic smile, a temper-to-break and an athletic physique in her role as a young surgeon who accidentally dropped to his boss at the hospital where he just started to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking women 50 women imaginable; she acts rival beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little difference the artifacts are!) Each of the characters strongly traces and excellently describes as well. The mixture of pithy dialogue and passionate passion makes this a delightful mining. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you can not normally improve by looking at "Reckless" - but you'll have lots of fun. (The end, part of the DVD box series, gives a wild yet satisfying two-hour degeneration. You will not want to miss it if you enjoyed what happened before.)
