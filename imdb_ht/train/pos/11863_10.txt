Perhaps this would be the best movie ever to make and if it's not readily one of those who burns on your student as that Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematic artwork. The first to touch the director of Brian De Palma has proven once again that he could be one of the best directors ever, has the superb performance from Al Pacino that deliver an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), Many different (violent) scenes that you never forget (one in the belt, one where Tony is sitting in a bath that is as big as most people's living room), there are many superb one-pieces (count how many times the word "f * ck" is used), there are many little details (Pan American - globe called "the world is yours") or great discomusic in Giorgio Moroder. There is nothing that can be called that is not sublime here and it's easy to do with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White Heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever!
