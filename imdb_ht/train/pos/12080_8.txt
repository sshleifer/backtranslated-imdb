Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary and the rich Hughes family to get on her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately it is drug and shipped to the family estate in Cornwall. When she got up to say she is Marion Hughes, who was mentally sick and kept her close ... but why? You will probably guess why, but do not mind because this one is fun. <br /> Together with the "narrow margin" and the "Face Behind Mask" this is one of the best B photos ever made. (B photographs were given photo budgets that were made quickly with low budget and no big stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles in the end that I get a bit too plausible to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead, but Witty Me Witty is great with George Macready's excellent (and scary) as bandits. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how to make a big movie on a small budget.
