I did not expect the powerful experience of "Girlfight". It is an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actor, freshman director. I heard he was good but not good. <br /> <br /> Set up a contemporary, ethnic, working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job in capturing day-to-day struggles in Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is clogged with anger and lashes from his high school colleagues, getting into trouble with school and friends. He was raised in his father's saloon, who loves his love and his brother, but applies a strict, gender-based double standard on his children. The double father's standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny's brother is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied the same activity. On an action in the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Little does not like boxing, so it's where Diana is trading; He gets the money from Dad then giving it to Diana to take the lessons in place. This is actually a feel-good film, as Diana grows and learns about himself in boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious self-esteem problems. There is no giggly, 'everything that can go right away' to a resolution "bend it like Beckham". The reality and personal attendance problems are too big for resolution, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for her.
