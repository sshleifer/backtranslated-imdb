The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and was not intended to be a demon end as Lamberto Bava even mentioned on the interview on the show Sheirk show, but it was called the III demons to be a part of the devil series. The music of the demons and demons 2 was 80 rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two were Gory Horror Demon III: The Ogre is an architecture horror so is how demon III is not an appropriate sequel demon but I'm still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is crawling and adding a tone to the movie that the movie puts in, the Ogre is another thing why I love the movie. There are two other films that are considered Demons III and that are Black Demons (Demons 3) and the Church (Devil 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie as long as you do not compare it with demon and demon 2.
