Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that tugs into your heartstrings harder than a mid-solo rock guitarist, the "seven books" race past collaboration before the director and the actor (the early pursuit), a flick of the movie I also love. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of her movies can jump by unnoticed if the actor is attached to the project is not quite so high-profile. <br /> <br /> Too bad I calculated Will Smith's scheme early in, I put two and two sets when she appealed to her own suicide at the first scene with the scene when Rosario Dawson's character presented as she was There is an incredible heart disease, I always think the writer / director has made the right choice to put the bookends (the bookends are the first and the last scene) in this way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the film, know gradually how exactly a man can drive into the final sacrifice, and he saves them to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's characters bloom and grow, knowing in the back of the mind always that was in store for these malheureux. One of my friends with whom I saw the film thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why his performance is almost impartial when the presence of his seven people is elected, yet again It would be difficult and scary, and when he was alone he filled the weight of his situation too much for him and he broke down. It is quite a versatile performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget to mention the re-deduction of the scene, which was really quite stunning to do in terms of scary cinematic music. Put this on your list.
