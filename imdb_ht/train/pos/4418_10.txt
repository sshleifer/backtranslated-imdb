Watch this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q & A afterwards. <br /> I found it hard to believe this is a first-time director and all of Kudos Harvey Keitel Again, he took a risk and came out on a member of a script he liked. Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, he tells the story of the director's youth about the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's position politics is pretty ambiguous. Many references to the obvious director of love of film history (a "thief" robbery "homage") and some fantasy scenes that work and out were firefighting.
