A journey through discovery, this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleeping, city island in British Columbia. Languorous and in dreams, residents are satisfied to allow life to go on their side until a young, fresh-faced teacher, and new ideas come and bring with life from the mainland. Slowly, they declare the indigenous states, the father (and the local director) looks for excitement, mother for stability, oldest daughter for love, and the least for power. While not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of movies, the movie is slowly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside Canada will find it easy to find.
