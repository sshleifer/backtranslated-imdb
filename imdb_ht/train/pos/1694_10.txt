If the creators of this film did any effort to introduce the reality of the plot, it would be just one more waste of time, money, and creative efforts. Fortunately, do not send any fears of reality in the winds, they created a funny wonder. Who can spend a movie in which an alien pilot spends the movie all act like Jack Nicholson, complete with the T-shirt Lakers. Do not cancel this movie as waste.
