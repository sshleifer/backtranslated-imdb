Any movie that shows federal PIG (People in Government) to be power-crazy threats in real life has a lot to recommend it to me. <br /> <br /> Alas, the script's oversight and editing and even, at times, the floppy directors will have those who will save the entire movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> I saw the original road back when it was new and hated, despised it, loathed it. Thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk. <br /> Now, though, I do not remember why. <br /> I believe that the two would not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> The rates are as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" provides a place of rallying, a banner for those who want to promote individualism, who believes in human rights, recognizes threats to the freedom of government and, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> The "Voice" puts a state-driven cap to New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans. Despite its obvious default, "Disable Point" is a movie applaud.
