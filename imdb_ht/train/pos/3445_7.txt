First, this was a BRAVE movie. I've seen irreversible and can understand the comparisons. However, I can not begin to understand who has trashed this movie. I can see how the end could be extreme but I should be lying if I did not say I wanted that every guy who ever forced a gender woman deserves exactly what Jared got. Conversely, she did not solve anything or do anything better with the fact that the movie does not pretend that's what I'm appreciating. <br /> <br /> The comment before this one is called the Native Movie and claims no adult would stick with them. I certainly did and stared. I have 24 years. Ways in the movie shooters have made it realistic with me. People have become so used to eyes candy and fast paced rhythms on screen that if you ask them to focus too long on one brick in the framework of a movie, not only to lose interest, they also demolish what was being built, and call it waste. When in reality it's lack of patience and understanding that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative idea like Talia Lugacy. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson appears to be self-destructing anxiety optimally. I think he described Mayan pre and post attack with ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely see doing well. Often times, as many as the "targeted adolescents" films mentioned in the previous comment, the effect of rape will appear as either very faint and impulsive or depressed, isolated and dead. Dawson, in my opinion, managed to make the act swing many survivors falling prey in drone-like existence in the awakened hours, working dead dead dead to survive (and distracting) and then overindulging into the lost scales head into the haze of drug abuse rather than face that moderation brings. <br /> I think this movie told the truth and I appreciate it for ultimately showing people a different side of rape. So many people left this movie devouring the middle and the beginning ... I believe that Maya's face during the act was the end ... does not act in itself ... by the vengeance or the meaning behind him ... just his face ... <br /> <br /> thank you
