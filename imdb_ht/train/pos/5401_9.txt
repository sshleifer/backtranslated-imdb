He is an incredible film-maker of Gwoza films that he could fill both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpieces, Goyokin, in the same year of 1969. And it is a testament to how criminal underrated it remains for the public general (compared with the darlings media like the big Akira Kurosawa), that both Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between the two. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada: curse dog killer, loyal to the Tosha family and Chef Takechi, played by another stalwart genre, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha tribe was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the Shogunate. External historical accuracy is accurate - with rapid Japan's growth between imperialists and Tokugawa and the West's pressure to complete a 300-year social and political exclusion. It helps a lot to know something or two about Japanese history and what eventually leads to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunat, but it is not essential in any means. The movie was made especially for a Japanese audience so certain things were being taken for granted but it flowed very well for the uninitiated as well. As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha movie in his golden year (late 60) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbols hiding behind image beauty. Style however is never decorative for Gosha - it is still working in the service of history. <br /> <br /> And speaking in history, Hitokiri dominated both literally and figuratively by the main character Izo Okada tortured. As most of the protagonists, Izo finds herself in a double-tied, torn between girly (bonds) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while to realize what exactly she's girip. In the first half of the film film is trying for independent social progress. Aspirations are high in social rank and marriage and an aristocratic daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the social rigid system of Japan's 19th century. <br /> <br /> The turning point for realization is when it comes to what self-advancement cost comes, the loss of identity and the consequence of the loss of self. It is at this point that it undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous Sword of the Tosha Clan to a nameless drifter without past or future, the Torazo Vagrant. Although not technically appointed and not a genuine drifter of Yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his former self and the cast of months, ambition and self-dillusion that allows the insights to see these things they really are and redeems himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> in the face of death.
