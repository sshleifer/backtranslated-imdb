I did not see each and every one of Chan's movies, but this is to ensure that the best one I've seen too far. The story of it itself is nothing special really, so I did not go deeper into that. What makes it special is the exhibition, the fight, the good act, the warm sense of humor. The film has a Tempo Speed ​​all the way through and you are just stunned to see it. All the freshest exhibits (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump around in the couch and cry. It's just scary! Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it. <br /> I know this story Police can be a bit difficult to get a hold, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth trying.
