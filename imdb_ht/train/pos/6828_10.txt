Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's baby) created a masterpiece with this 1977 movie. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and a queen by Peter Falk. The first of the film: An aging stage with actress film (Gena Rowlands) re-evaluates her life after a obsessed fan of a car accident trying to find her autograph. The movie has a slow speed with a dark, moody, awesome quality. He had a Cinematic look at 60's and even reminded me of the Baby Rosemary's Polanski without the supernatural horror. The fears here are they all successful actors have - it will become old and will become useless to his career. In addition, he feels that he has lived a life lacking in true spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived only for her career - she has no children, does not do charity works, etc. The gradual gradualness of her personality is the flesh of this film. It fell apart. It's a crisis. Gola Rowlands really gets into psyche suffers the character and acts of the party very well. He is a terrific actress and 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period with or the disaster films or adventure exercises. It's a movie with many deep-seated emotions but there's a cold, cynical feel, as Cassavetes will criticize the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's. Either this or this film is a product of the 70 which has been itself cynical in many aspects - Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great, and this film is not well-known , it's a very haunting and humorous movie. Kudos of Cassavetes are disassociated with late deaths of late 80.
