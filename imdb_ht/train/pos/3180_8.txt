A friend lent me this DVD, which he received from the director of a festival, I think. I went to warn that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit unstable and that the writing was good, but not great. So, maybe my color trials, but I must admit that I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Statue where actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a way unlikely. Adam Jones (also led) and Justin Lane were excellent as the colloquers driving Ernie angry. The Bill Charity (Justin Lane), which spends a lot of the movie dressed as a panda, is by far my favorite; It seemed less than one dimension, and reminded me of an old college college I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of beautiful, and very funny. Some of the other acting were good, some were so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really love the duo vigilante. Ridiculous and funny. <br /> I give one high mark, though it has some problems, because you can tell when you look at that person who cares, and decides to make the movie their way. Well done Adam Jones and crew.
