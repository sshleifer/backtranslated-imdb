People who headed the 'Third Man' also lead 'who will buy' the sequence of "Oliver!" Now that's talent. <br /> I woke my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> I know there are 'second units' involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And she faced with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> I suppose the quality comes out. <br /> (It's shown in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding Spoiler - everyone will see Oliver for the first time].) How many lines I need to be typed. <br /> <br /> Encourage people to type too much is not to be encouraged. <br /> <I hope this count as the "10th line".
