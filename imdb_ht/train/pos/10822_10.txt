I was lucky enough to get this movie many years ago in England. I saw hundreds of movies since, but I never forgot this one. Despite Sinatra played a not very attractive character, it was excellent in the role. There are many people seem to think it did'nt really enter her own until her role in "from here for eternity" but in my opinion it was magnificent in Concho.The other role that stick to myself is that of William Conrad.I'd never seen or heard of before that movie. Conrad plays a terrific party in this movieI remember the deep voice and really read it and uses it very well to improve the few words he speaks with a threat that sets the tone of his character .Also I remember the music , which both introduces Conrad and it seems to surround him every time he looks. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never had ever seen it again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the titles that she says that the film is in black and white but when I saw it was true of full color, I remember the sinatra's blue shirt.
