This movie was one of my kids' favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in this period The thief in Baghdad was held on quality while I was growing up. This is not just a movie to be enjoyed by the kids, it can look and enjoy by adults too. The only disadvantage there is that one can not see past the bad effects' (compared to the effects nowadays) as one could when one was a child. I remember nothing of these effects, of course it was about ten years since I would see this film, when I was about eleven years old. Who then will watch the effect? One only seeks good stories and entertainment, and that's exactly what the movie gives. In my mind this movie is one of the first big adventure films in the 20th century. Come to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones movie is quite a like this movie. There are comedy, romance and adventure all in one, creating a wonderful mix that will take you from the beginning until the end and although the movie is old and the music and style of the movie are not clearly modern successful in dust and exterior. All of this is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and performance are good acting of the actors. In that Sabu department (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, give the comedy and the cooling elements of the movie for the most part. Big movie and although an 'oldie', definitely a Goldie. I hope someone has the brain and bowel released this one on DVD a day. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
