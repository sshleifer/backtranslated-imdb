I'll always be a soft spot for this Disney flick, another part of live action / party animation party that sought to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never make it well. When I was in the classroom, every time we would have a movie day, where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria, and a movie would projected the old-fashioned way, multiple coils and all. At that time, it seemed like an important occasion every day that day arrived, and "Bedknobs and broomsticks" are one of the movies I can remember to see this way. <br /> And from what I remember, it's good. Angela Lansbury has never put his name on anything that was not at least competent, and has here as a witch and a magical bed (boy, who might misconstrued, could not read?) Who can take it and a couple of teenagers about magical adventures in the distant places. Come, what does not want a kid like that? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
