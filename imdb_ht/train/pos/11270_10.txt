Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easy to Jane's most gorgeous ever, and never will be one more gorgeous. It is visually stunning. That aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. It does not just have the classic Tarzan Aura, but also the feeling of the legend continues. We become involved with two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, a nasty catalyst that can character be one of the best defined and better examined in film history. And these characters They are what makes this great action flick stand out as a classic. There is racial unrest that represents. However, the Africans are portrayed as people, and in the end, two become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one does not call reminders probably more sympathy to the audience than any other character. The final, too, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The big lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is quite implicit and more character reaction than a modern Gore film would make and graphic illustrations. If I leave anything out, it is because I do not want to soil the image for those who have not seen it. But it is everything you might want in a movie.
