I was not born until 4 years after this wonderful show first revealed, but my luck managed to catch the reruns in the middle of 90 and the rest is story ...... I was hooked. The company was very simple; Two Nemesis Firms, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are sponsored by an expert (if not young) Doctor and biologist (Sharron Macready) head up behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used not red china. Also escaped, the aircraft are struck by fire machine guns and crashes in the heart of the Himalayas where life is saved by a mysterious and previously unexplored civilization that heals and improves the essence of the trio, thus setting the scene for many people interesting adventures come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted for 30 hours long episodes and I guess it was relatively short lived, a run season that put it for cult status. <br /> <br /> <Monty Berman, the producer, was notorious for doing things as cheap as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this incredibly pathetic device - particularly in episodes such as "Happening" (a studio depot for the Australian flood ) and 'Snow' at "Deep Freeze Operation" and "Start", but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. He has a great mix of adventure, and humorous therapy (especially in some criticism of a terrific one from William Gaunt). Chemistry from the three drives was fantastic - you get the sense of being really having a lot of fun doing the show and this makes out in 2005 documentary reunion where the three meetings followed over 35 years of reminisce on the show (and laughing about Anthony Nicholls terrible peach !!). They all shared equally screen time and all had the brightest moments. I said, I was still a fan of Richard Barrett - I liked her sardonic humor with which dangerous edge - it was certainly a man you did not cross, with the eyes ........ the eyes bluest you would probably see on television. I also followed Bill Gaunts's career and interest since. However, Craig Stirling certainly would have had her band of female fans and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male swooning fans too. <br /> <br /> The show also had a plethora of stars and shooters, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! . <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this show For the first time, or look after it for many years, remember to look in the context of time it's done and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and chemistry from three leads are what made this wonderful show for me and I do not think I'll ever shoot at it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
