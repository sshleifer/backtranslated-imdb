Steve Carrel proves himself to be a great man who leads to this wonderful, original, blown raunchy in cool air. I'm wet myself in how geniusly hilarious it was. Basically the movie title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man working in an electronic store. It's a bit of a nerd that loves videogames and comics, and has the largest collection. His comrades who work in the store with him find that he is a virgin during a rather gender poker game sex dialogue, and then Andy has to go through a rather funny as Hell Odyessy in awakening crude rude, but always fucks up which leads him not to lose his girl, but he eventually gets lucky at the very end. <br /> <br /> Let the little ones in the house, but take the whole family to see this awesome comic romantic adult. It will have you hooked and cracked up in the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you'll want you to wear your extra thick thick absorbs. Only the other thing I can say about it is too bad to Steve Carrel was not recognized as a person 20 years ago. It is definitely going to be the best male performance tool in the coming year MTV Movie Award. You can bet you earn dollars over that, people! <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
