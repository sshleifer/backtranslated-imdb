The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy that starred once with Bond Girl Ursula Andress. Man was hot in this movie .. He was stacked and built like a house # brick house. Ursula has been smoking hot in this movie. I never saw the nurse filling out before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Andress star as a nurse who is empowered to care for a rich elderly. Even one in the house seems to be knocking boots. One night, the nurse decided to take the seed temperature and give some T.L.C needed. of her former client. The old man takes in his nurse, and this rabies the rest of the family. What kind of family work has been hired to do? Is the geezer falling to his car? How can it deal with the octogenarian crown and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of SENSUAL NURSE !! Italian but seriously armed in English. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
