I continue to watch this movie over and over and over. I have to look at it at least once a week. I came from Africa and looked at that movie taught me some things that I did not even know about Africa. Denzel movies are full of lessons for people walking in life. I wish he was my own brother. I've also seen and loved your Mississippi Masala. What a thrilling situation. When Denzel tried to crush his brother up to work, reminding me of my teenage years when my brother was always upset with me about getting myself occupied all the time. My brother always took care of my old father and wants to see me in the same way. By the way where Denzel finds the African African film of Freedom Cry? I first saw that the film in Africa and I did not know then that Denzel was American until I moved down here.
