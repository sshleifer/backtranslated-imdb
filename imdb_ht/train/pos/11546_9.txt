First Ever Watch: July 21, 2008 <br /> Very impressive scenario and comedy acting and distribution of this movie. Now 40 years old, he lost none of his power. Neil Simon shows excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedy performance. Neil Simon was inspired by real events in his own life to write play in this movie based. One of the best writers who writes and acts Hollywood ever! Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Movie Editing". Hollywood rarely commits pricing, no matter how well they have done.
