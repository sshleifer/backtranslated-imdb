How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was, and still, the best documentation in Texas life for the long period. Consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk at night bar, married to solve a fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. Try with the name of a movie that paint real life so clear. They do not do it again. It looks like the current films are always about people who have a lot of money, they live in big houses, drive expensive cars and do not work. This movie has a celebration scene about finding a trailer for Pete's debt! Anyway, I look at it at least once a week. No kidding. I've been dissecting this movie since the end. feel free to email me to learn more about why I call it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud View Sissy - are divided - it amikably honks and waves, it jumps to the bird - it returns half the peace sign honking cone it adds impact then tears. <br /> <br /> Mom's buds call her approx. 18 hours after entering the city, on Sunday, to see if he has a job again - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and wearing (x2) with the help of his uncle and aunt. <br /> "You all live like pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Is it necessary? Could not we figure it out without showing the room shedding? God I love that! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help him ride the bull. Only a few days (or perhaps the next day) after Wes just kicks the crap out of her husband. Steve asked - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, you do not beat my husband up the other night, so let's get this goon ', do not make any mention of the fact that he is seeking consolation at him later during one Bud and Sissy's many battles, which By the way all take place in public - at the Gilley! <br /> <br /> The wedding reception photo taken (oh the humanity!) could at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "My legs are mothers 'sweatshirts' <br /> In conclusion, you do not wear scenes like this in a movie trying and show insight into human psychology. It's a documentary in real life. <br /> I just want to have have a director cut.
