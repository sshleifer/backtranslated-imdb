Well, that was a pretty good damn episode. Better than the credit it receives. <br /> <br /> The camera work is splendid. Better yet. I love the final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are large and thrown to guests (less desperate victims) is strong. <br /> What I do not like about this episode is that many things are left unreasonably. why does it change sex? what is the goal? and they are aliens? what kind? why have never been shown again in the mythology later? <br /> I give this great episode to the THREE stars. One of my favorites yet, but the drawings twitched me. Still ... will not let him ruin my entertainment.
