Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this film modern-day a winner. In the three, I do not know who was the most interesting as all offers good performance and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric makes the narration of this, playing an old boxing and mental patient. Wow, that alone makes for an exciting guy! It looks dumb, but it's not. Ward is menister, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co-conspirator in a kidnapping that goes bad. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never neglected to captivate on any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie can be regarded as the quality of Downer Viewer on average, but I found it fascinating .... and I do not like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of original crime movie. Take a look and see if you agree. This movie is very sex that should not have this status because it's simply a good and well-done story.
