This is a big movie that I do not think gets enough credit as Saturday Saturday Fever or Fat John Travolta's career. She plays a man in love with a girl, but too licking pigs admitted her feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks he'll show his bravery. Even though he did in 1980, he was still timely today. The country's great music band is terrific. 10/10
