Randolph Scott is heading to Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. However, along the way, the scene is kept up - even if they do not carry a stuffing. However, a lovely lady on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the thieves seem to know this. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle on the job. However, it soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - the typical bad guy from the west. You know, the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And, it just happened that this jerk was behind the flight. Scott asks that the uncle returns the money and then Scott goes to business with the beautiful lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising, this is NOT the end of the issues --- just in the beginning. Again and again, various intrigues are designed to tackle the uncle's opposition. A trick is to bring in a beautiful lady to treat Scott's friends and his partner. It's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott - until he figure out why he came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most later Randolph Scott movies, this one shows Scott as a bit more to Headstrong people. All too often in her film is one of the latest suggests violence, but in this movie it is quick to suggest a lynching (vice law is to have a hangin ') and later it's quick to threaten the uncle. What a surprise to see him as such a warm head - though in most other ways, it is even the old Scott you would expect. As far as the movie goes, nothing is particularly unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the baddie can not resonate and finally destroy and Scott gets the girl. Despite this trait is very typical, it's all very busy and as a result is well worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two unusual scenes in the movie. First, late in the movie, there is a fight between Scott and # 1 henchman uncle, Lon Chaney, Jr .. In it, Chaney smoked as he fights - something I never saw before and I admired that as he could blow away as he got his butt chase. Secondly, get a load on the Runaway cartoon scene with the whip - now that one feat is impossible!
