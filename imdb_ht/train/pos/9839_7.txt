Hmmm, yes this episode is very upset. Though there are a lot of bad writings and acting in party. I think the good thing happens to the bad one. I love the origami parts and great 'twist' in the end. I absolutely love the scene when Michelle meets Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes in Season 1. <br /> For some reason, people have always hated the Reincarnation episodes, yet I still love them. They are not the best, in terms of writing. but the theme really interests me, <br /> I'll give it a THREE star, but if the writing was a little more consistent I would give it four.
