A very exciting entertainment, with the charm of the old films. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment requires it, and we all enjoy with his success. Most interesting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating they just with human skills (it was a big swim and had a big cry)
