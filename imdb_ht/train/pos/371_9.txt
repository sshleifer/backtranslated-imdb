I remember when this movie was up for the Academy Awards and did not have any of them. For the life of me, I can not remember what he was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg led the film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> Essentially, she's about a black woman's trial and tribulation as she grows out of a girl in a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and anxious, but they all need to see how many women have been set up. Along the way, we see other women who have to stop with the difficulties and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg has best performances ever in this film. Danny Glover should also be at least nominated for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its human subjects, not as some wildlife show as the favorite "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone in any race to see this movie. 9/10
