The characters were alive and interesting, the draw was excellent rhythm, the Pyro effects were masterfully accomplished, and it took a love love triangle to love story and shoots into a science-fiction element in it. I was able to identify with many of the characters and motivations that made logical sense of rationality in the framework of the story. <br /> <br /> The camera-work was great, the clear and accurate audio, the background music perfectly selected for effect, the firemen sing a wonderful talent memorable talent, the brilliantly crafted sets, and the special effects are made with a skilled talent. <br /> I'm a tad believe how a whole mini-carnival in the chain-store parking lot can walk by one lamppost outlet. This seems impossible at least. The fight between the close close-ups of the film was brilliant though. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role has also been a nice touch that has played the semi-serious role of a very good carny.
