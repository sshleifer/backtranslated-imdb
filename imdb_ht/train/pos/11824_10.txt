Dick Tracy is easy to film the best movie-based movie made on date. The film has the same feeling as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. The series was up, fall, up and down again. Dick Tracy has the power to stay as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The gentlemen triumph over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across. Al Pacino does a great job in his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best work far is Warren Beatty who just epitomized Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape will bring thin.
