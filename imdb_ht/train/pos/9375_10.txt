Before Nicholas Cage was a great action star, she was a great actor. This smallest-known movie is where cage gives one of its best performances. "Red Rock West" was a small budget, almost un-known movie, but is one of my favorite movies ever. I discovered she walked down to the video store, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who is great in the movie) appearing together. Go to this one, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
