I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? I actually do not know), but I have to admit, heard about a silver / hero movie, I expected quite a bit different than I actually received. <br /> While it was typing to look at this first, it was nice to watch this move along. You can never really say where it goes (some twists are foreseeable, but in general, you can never really say it was going to end up). A more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good cast cast, making this an enjoyable look. Not as action packed as some can expect or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mix.
