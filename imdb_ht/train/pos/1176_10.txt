Firstly let me say that I did not like the fact that the Rock won the title that is so gay. Next I feel shabby should have returned its European title, Jeff Hardy is a torn champ. Rob Van Dam has been titled Intercontinental too long ago Brock should have it. I am pleased with Storm and Christians have tag champs, the best match was the Booker T and Big Show Match in my opinion.
