Jim Carrey is quite commonplace, and though there are a few "Jim Carrey moments", it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> It's aimed mostly at the kids, and I managed to enjoy it as the movies. He was encouraged in Israel as another Jim Carrey film, so those who expect a weird about the top comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie has beautiful moments and works well as a movie for kids. I can not say I like this movie, but then again I'm not targeting its target!
