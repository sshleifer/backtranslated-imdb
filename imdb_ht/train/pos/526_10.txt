If ever anyone asks if Cinema is an art form, you can do worse than the shows in this movie. <br /> <br /> Quite simply it is the perfect combination of history, script, actor and cinematography ever engaged in celluloid. The story of a bomber bomber pilot is scolded by the heavenly conductor of the English fog during the second world war, with his subsequent brush and the celestial authorities (or is it in his head) is played with panache by David Niven and Kim Hunter and are extremely touched - especially in the opening scenes when the pilot is convicted (Niven) describing his congestion in the land radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The essence of otherworldliness is intensified by Jack Cardiff's photography and incredible production drawings. The extreme supreme touches of the sky shots appear in black and white scenes with Earthbound presented in Technicolor - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> It's not just a high of British movies, but a highpoint in movies, periods.
