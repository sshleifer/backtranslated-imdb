I saw Sunday afternoon film. I absolutely love this movie. I liked everything about her, from the burning moments of mother and daughter to the scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) is crying because of her poor decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she is really in love . I loved these moments because they were just so real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped he would not end up like Bobby, who was a great cast but a bad movie written with no real meat. But during the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see tonight once again. Trust me when I tell her to see her!
