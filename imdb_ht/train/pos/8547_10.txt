A lot of people hated this movie, but I blamed on reality - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American pie cinema. and 2 - are trying to take it too seriously. <br /> One that I found was the best one out of every six, and I absolutely love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I'll say that, but then what is the young comedy is NOT? Road trips, dancing works etc. are all extremely predictable, but still funny! I say this worth watching, I love it, I get it hilarious. Just do not look at it while comparing it to those first because it does not have anything. <br /> After watching Naked Mile with this one, it became evident that all the American Pie movies were over, and only on, the Stiflers. Which is FINE by me. <br /> <br /> Look. Enjoy. Love. xD
