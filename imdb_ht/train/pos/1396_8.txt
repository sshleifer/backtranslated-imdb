Probably one of the prime examples of a suspense, dramatic episodes (in this case, the superb balance of Terror) and a lighter affair, Shore Coast is the first true truth on the name of the Star Trek writers to produce a more fun piece in sci-fi, and while the formula is not quite right again in this entry (the true triumph is troubles and tribles, in Season 2), laughs are coming very fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all silliness la. <br /> <br /> The entertainment of the show tradition, the Enterprise is not about any good mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time on service: a well-deserved break after three months of incessant work. Planetary Earth-like (a budget-related reality) is something appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have a vision of a white rabbit that seems to come straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, others begin to experience the same thing: a woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double and last meeting, in the form of almost love and The guy who used to choose on him in the Academy. Throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's happening on before anybody gets hurt. The idea is one classic: where idyllic turns out to be far from the sky. Humorous episode's on the subject is rather successful, not for a dark turn of events that do not sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again to come to the end) and the general unwillingness of the cast shown one side funnier at the top (most notably, and ironically, otherwise hilarious William Shatner). But Shore Kite deserves recognition of being another good example of the writers trying new, already unseen things: the definition of the success of the Star Trek. <br /> 7,5 / 10
