Well, I'll admit the casting of the movie is really weird - part of this is due to the scheme, but I still had a bit of trouble believing Pierce Brosnan playing this lead (though he really did a job very good). <br /> It is based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He stated that he is a non-mixed Indian. He was, in fact, so successful and well-thinking of people who came from all over to hear his conferences and be taken on his desert treasures - even though he was not a white Indian with his full knowledge was from books or fake! This film was created with what happened when fake was discovered. Acting and setting were great and I loved the movie (once I stopped believing on Brosnan). He did not find widespread distribution - probably because it was beautiful Cesarean - not a Bond film or romance - just a really odd movie about a remarkable man.
