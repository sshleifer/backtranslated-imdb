The Zuuit Legion is probably the most exciting movie I've seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With visual visual performances and stories of wine proportions, the Zuu Montager saga sounds on its viewers and its majesty. This film is amazingly crafted in the use of high tech cgi that allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. Acting is perfect for this movie; if you were an immortal and supernatural power I would think you would keep more in mind. <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments in many, the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can not keep track of the different characters simply should not pay attention since or used at the levels of complicated as the titanic. The plot will engage with layers and theme so seasonal that they will leave you gasping for air. The Zuig League is on a level of greatness so high that maybe many people are stripped of its scope. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed in its beautiful vision and you will grow to love this movie.
