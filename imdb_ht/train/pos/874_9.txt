This movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters. I popped it to my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone review) and was intrigued for two solid hours. Two lost ships in two different worlds collide. The sexual tension between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact. Towards the end I could not decide which I wanted more: Our heroes and heroines pulled on the Caper or simply consummate passions. RML could be done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minute would be great. I'm nitpicking though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local library dudes this movie restore my faith to making great movie.
