This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London which, through a strange set of circumstances, is discovered by English but is an annex in the French province of Bordeaux. comic actor Stanley Holloway (it's best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR), as well as a host of other classic classic actors in the period. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the Canadian government "officially" gave a hotel room to a European visit to royalty. The idea actually reminded me of the real life case in the province of Hutt in Western Australia, where a landowner "seceded" to the Australian Government due to a quotas discussion. (It is never recognized by Western Austrian or Australian governments). This is a great script that plays a lot of political and economic issues, rather than the TV show "Yes Minister"; as well as being a unique piece of unique character.
