This is a script that Ed Wood has worked about 10 years on trying to get made. Aris Iliopulos finally got chutzpah to film a script that saved Wood from his burning house at the expense of other, more transit values. <br /> <br /> This is a free dialogue movie, that some can easily be described as silent. In fact, it's a noisy film, without the devastating chants in most flicks. In the hands of these filmmakers, the music effects and sounds provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from Hollywood to the script mill, particularly that film movie movie Billy Zane has been in ('Look Out!' , 'Oh no!' - J. Cameron .... i ...) I'll take Zane's great monosyllabic communication friendly in this movie on empty dialogue any day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane led a team player who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods are bright when you can wear Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andre McCarthy's name on the same poster. The design is perfect, the exquisite pyramid, and Ron Perlman's beastly performance is simply wonderful. In general, this is a chaotic, cheers visionary appeal manufactured by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and sininfile. A must see for anyone really enjoying the roadside movies that the first Iliopulos percentage and dropping it obviously does. A movie makes you want you did it yourself.
