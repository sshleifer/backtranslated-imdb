Love the characters and the story line. Very funny and lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer provide great performance. I enjoyed the dynamic and comic interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, burning out striker. All three actors are among my favorites and have them in this movie made for a special treat. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Goodnight Kiss Kiss, The Abyss, And The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
