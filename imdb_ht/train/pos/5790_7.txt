Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (he speaks Russian), then I surrender now. In her short skirt, high-top boots, and pronounced bubble bust, she is a real babe, though zombie-like eye-shadow sort of come and go. This 30 minute is no doubt the sexiest of the series. Note well matching realistic struggles with Bronson until it is gallantly bullet over the chin, damaging all the fun. Well, I probably should leave in my hormonal response. <br /> This is a very well-half-hour product by which underrated forces behind the success series, Buck Houghton. Of course, the producers want to lead in the third quarter with an average upper entry. It's America's nuclear-holocaust post (we know because it's part of the invading forces) and only American Bronson and Soviet Union Montgomery leave, along with about twenty tons of real-world invasions. They wander in the midst of the alternate humorous destruction, while wondering how long it will take for Political Trump Biology, which of course it eventually makes, (likely Bronson). And that's about it. There is no real talk, except for what Bronson said is very trapped. However, the scenario is always fun, and rather daring for its time, even suggests that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular cold stereotype of the time). The rather curious Slavonic-looking Bronson (Buchinsky) would be cast as the American and Montgomery in the brilliant-looking as Slavic. Appearance-wise, it should be the reverse. I guess is that the producers did not want to throw the American into the physically weaker role of the girl, regardless of appearances. However, there is little of the usual TZ scary or atmosphere, yet the episode remains a very, very watchful 30 minute.
