Before films such as the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Suspiria,' and 'Halloween' changed the look of horror forever, there was a more gothic and far less violent era of the genre. Movies such as Hammer's Hammer and Baby 'The Rosemary' series are scary and thrilling hearings throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can not tell you how often I rented this movie during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to the slasher and movie cinema in the 70s and 80s and films like this output from the famous, but sadly go away Amicus movie company was a good start. <br /> Why: A grand, weird music notes. Strong performance comes from a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. Many good old fashioned thrill and thrill, especially in the first and last stickers. There are moments of haunting with images. Movement in a slow, but slower. The house is one spooky, staying oppressive. Great design and decoration design, which gives the film a real old Gothic feel. Since more on the atmosphere and without chills than on the throat and scratching nudity for emotional emotions. <br /> <br /> Account: Some problems slow down in the first half. Aside from the 'dress,' the rest of the stories feel like they've been doing before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, 'Waxworks,' has a fine acting moment, but is the weakest of the card in terms of crisis and suspense. The budget really shows at times. <br /> <br /> Last thinking: After seeing this movie for the first time in many years I can see why I rent it so often. It's not a prince by any means, but it's a good example of a time when horror movies are made with style and class. Watch this one and the lights off. <br /> Rating: Rating: 3.5 / 5
