One of the first of the best musical, Anchors Aweigh features several memorable music sequences, such as Kelly Dancing and Jerry Mouse, Kelly Dancing and 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra Singles and Jose Iturbi playing piano, Kathryn Grayson songs and Iturbi performs, and more. The techniqueolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work like seeing a piano played from below, in transparent keys, and Grayson songs, seeing in another camera. The plot is thin, but you participate in Kelly's enthusiasm & sinatra. The sailor on leave, they must take home a runaway boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra fall for his aunt. To put it with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can find her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But the young and naughty sinatra in this one, and in singing singing songs fell in love too fast. While trying to contact Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly's now falls in love with Grayson. An aweigh anchors are most often remembered for the combination of live-action / drawing sequences with Tom and Jerry, but there is a lot more here this is worth a look. I give it nine stars because, while it's not quite as good as the best Musical - Singin 'in the Rain, the Music Man, Oklahoma - it is one of the first in the classes of Technicolor great output (possibly meeting me, in St. Louis was the first), and better than most others.
