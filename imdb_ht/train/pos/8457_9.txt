Gundam my wing is a good anime. Slightly slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but on all enjoyable. Now, before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "wanderer", I'll admit that I've watched all of the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the MS 08 team, and Gundam SEED. I'll admit that there was a few problems with the story saying and a few characters might seem to be "rip-offs" (ie the original Gundam's Zechs Marquise Char), but this is an alternate universe show based on original series there, as is SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series make sure you watch the original Gundam first, and then know that you are watching an AU series.
