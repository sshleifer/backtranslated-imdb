I am glad that this is available on DVD right now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style on lightweight LED flashing lights & constant loud noise. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short span of attention or lack of understanding & imagination engaging with narrative literary you will not like this movie. The reason for this is quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of novel Roman Storr 'Marianne Dream' successfully in a scenario. An unmissable job as anyone who saw a movie in a book will undoubtedly know. The casting is excellent, allowing Bernard Rose's director to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen right now; they appreciate the craft of acting! I know, I know, actors do their work and act instead of resorting to embracing justice in the camera camera lens a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and fire fighting breaks out of them is a really rare treat, but it actually happens to this movie. <br /> This brings me to the ultimate reason that this is a movie for the imaginative and not-reader-thunderstorm thoughts - Apart from a solid script, direction & act, it relies on atmosphere , suspension & implies horrors. If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. In conclusion then, if you like loud noise, blast, constant cut, & bright flashing color you'd better watch 'Transformers', but if you like a thriller story unfolding in a skillful and evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence or food force or cigarette effect then this might just be your thing.
