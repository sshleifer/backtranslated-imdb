After watching "guinea pigs", two questions come to mind (besides 'Are I really a psychopath to watch it?'): 'Is it a snappy?' The answer is no; although it's the closest thing to a thin film I've ever seen. Then 'Where did the hell find that girl?'. Because it gets tortured for '45 min, without any reason given (in fact, nothing else in this movie!): Nail teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infected by maggots, ... and much more until the final scene (I still do not know how to do that). Because it belongs to the 'underground Japanese scene', it's obvious he did not get a lot of money. So what was he (s) motivating? <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogue, the boys are just insulting him to a few scenes). I have not seen all the series yet, but the first "guinea pig" does not know for being the best one. Still I was rated 8, because if the goal was to make people believe this a mournful, the problem is quite good (asks Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, which they did in the following. <br /> Another movie I hide from my parents. <br /> 8/10
