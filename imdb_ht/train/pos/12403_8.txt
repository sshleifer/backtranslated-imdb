You should be forgiven to think that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing an American horror movie (especially a whole one located inside a US prison) - seeing this to prove yourself wrong! It was produced in the 80's after all and the movie was made on a more fitting budget in a modern Brick TV company recording (something I think anyone would really notice nowadays what and practically everybody was familiar to $ 100m + budget for action films unfortunately dominating industry ideas!) Mr Harlin's first production was bigger and - at least that nowadays should be considered a stellar - cast. I still think most of the Nordic contribution in the film industry as a whole is much more done with the Stellan's screen (not to mention properly cover Mr (s) Bergman's efforts) - at least for every girl - but this flick The film really proves to have existent film talent outside of the US and Hollywood to let us watch a movie in suspense. Strive and watch this movie even if you're not a horror blow, IMO it's definitely worth it!
