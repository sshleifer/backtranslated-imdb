Having watched this movie strictly on the strengths of review reviews I was most pleasantly surprised. Although clearly budgeting is low, it brings the signs of intelligence intelligent. For example, when Julia awakens in the strange home and looks out the window I find I think its essence of insulation should increase with an exterior shot focusing on her face and then moving backwards include the house and location its insulated. But look! The next scene was exactly the last shot in the house standing lonely on the cliff in the water's edge. There are other examples of how a smart director can elevate his movie to a very enjoyable thrill level. Savvy spectators will surely spot their spots but should make sure they will not be disappointed. As performances, George Macready is his usual creepy climb, barely holding his serenity while suggests an unadulterated violence capacity. Nina Foch was surprisingly well-meaning no-nonsense working girl who is not about to submit without a fight. But Dame Me Witty, oh boy, she even suffered my own eyes and believes that she could get away with her evil schemes. That's a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.
