Having read the diamond book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments and comforting to know that 'mighty warriors' are hard at work, see 'attack' on 'Western civilization' under each carpet. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little preachy? Make sure. Like a lot of academic, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase "gun, microbes, and steel" to lose all opportunities during the series. We found it, after about 10 minutes at first. <br /> <br /> Are Diamonds a little simplistic (in the series)? Make sure. The Part of the Spaniards in South America is particularly fun, condensing some very long history, complicated down to 'traps, swords, and horses', packaging up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains invaluable - things made in fact contributed (but not entirely defined) the reasons for the successful success of the established cultures. Did he preach against Western civilization in any way? Nope. Not a word. By my ears. All that it says is likely to play a major part in determining which culture is faster, * not * that chance is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors influencing how society succeeds or weakens, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
