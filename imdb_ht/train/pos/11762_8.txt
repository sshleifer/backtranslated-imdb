I believe that many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is quoted in the film, "The Best of Times." In this story a middle-aged banker, called Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from the abyss of a football error, which happened years ago, inspired re-playing the game. . again. In order to accomplish this he must convince the football once a football, Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to make a comeback. For Reno, who is satisfied with his present presence in life, the viewer does not need to change the past record, which finds in his best-age. Added to both the problem is fact years have passed and in addition, both weddings are floundering and the need to re-vampire. It's not easy when his father (Donald Moffat) is familiar to remind him of the biggest drop. But Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the greatest blunder of his life. Great fun for anyone who wants to enjoy the teens again. ***
