New York dramatist Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and quick maneuver; as the movie opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV review was keen on Caine, and he became drunk. Pass from the Long Island Railway to Caine in Montauk, instead of its residence in East Hampton. Finally, Caine is comforted by well-worn wife of Cynan Cannon (like Myra), a sick patient-hearted patient. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called Deathtrap, written by young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's alumni. The couple believes Mr Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> The Trap Were For A Funny Who-Do It. <br /> <br /> Led by Sidney Lumet, the long-running Broadway Ira Levin does not lose too far from the background to its scenes.The cast is enjoyable and the torsion story is still angrossing. Something that did not work (for me) the curtain has been appealed to completion, surely he played best on stage. "Deathtrap "is a fun movie to look again; performances are dying over - but in retrospect, Reeve's greetings give Caine to East Hampton train stations should be simplified in a smile" Hello. "The place is not really East Hampton, but winds And the bachelor's favorite scene is shocking tepid. But the game was so good, "even a gifted director could not ruin it." And Mr Lumet does not disappoint. / / <br /> ***** Two Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
