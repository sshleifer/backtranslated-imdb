I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of music on Vinyl. I saw this special Christmas when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later released. Later the release missed several songs though. I see that he has released this year with all the original songs. My surprise I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - they think a Christmas cd would be worth so much. For me there is no amount that is worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I never could get it on VHS or DVD. I would like to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks
