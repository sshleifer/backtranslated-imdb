Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experience is Without a Star ***** star on first glance, it's a realistic creepy creepy and disturbing look at the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right to the point, can you think of points? The point is to satisfy the fan of just extreme violence and gore. This movie has some whipping, more or less just torturing a woman violence. There are really only 3 scenes that might consider Gore. I'll tell you one thing though if Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment makes hostile look like Street Sesame. If you thought hostile was a brutish insane disturbing hole hole then you did not see half of it until you saw guinea pigs: the Devil's experience. <br /> <br /> Rating Movie 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Experience Devil (Uncut) ***** (7)
