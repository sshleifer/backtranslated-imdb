I knew about but never seen Gray Gardens before I saw Broadway music in the same name. Friends warn me that I did not see the movie, the music would not make sense. He did, but he also encouraged me to rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a wreck train, full of weird, torn characters, and it was very hard to look. But being able to stop it, digging it, back in it made me realize why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their extreme lack of self-esteem is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite the invading armies. They have a relationship that will chew any woman (and without a few people), and make you re-examine your own behavior with your mother. At a time when TV shows and movies are commonplace, it's fascinating to view the Mayleses' work from three decades ago, and to realize what a movie impact has to do. <br /> I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into these peuples by their relatives? But beyond, how are people living in the 1970s able to escape reality into a complete fashion? Or were they simply considering crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the Next track, which gave me more insight into the movie.
