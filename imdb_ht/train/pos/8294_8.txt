This movie has great battle scenes. Now it's true that the act is a little rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a cheesy movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying air cast like many films around now who are about to kill the uterus. Then look at this. Now it's true of the main stars in the show where the kid shows the Power Rangers and another cast member showing that there is a small part of this movie. But the hey scene fought them enough to make Jet Li p ** s his pants. And the exhibits are worthy of Jackie Chan to sit thrown and admired.
