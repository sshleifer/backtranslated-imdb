An excellent movie with great performances from Zack & Lochley. Many of the harassings (& min) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All due to Jerry Doyle but in Season 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It did not take him long to criticize Zack (which I love best of all on the show) and taking charge. I'm sure Zack could coped. The Soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky as Zack does. The humorous supplement humorous. 10/10
