... This is not the first time Stanley distinguishes the distinction between genres like great effect, either. At Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a terrible situation, and here the base is a terrifying storyline that actually produces some very funny moments. Slow-burn madness and try to kill one's family by hilarious neck, but the dialogue is very familiar ("five months in peace is just what I want ...") and there is a terrific drinking scene that should be bad if you include just one kind of spirit, but it's spine-chilling when you factor in the other. <br /> I do not agree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The Nicholson signed the hearing as an actor merely hinting at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcohol and is emotionally far away from his wife and son. The environment that it is in, however, then absorbs these personality defects and unleashes them on its awareness. In many similarities with buildings sometimes thought to soak up the events that happened, the hotel eats the vulnerabilities of a troubled but similar man, and uses his weakness against it to eventually take it beyond the point not return. It may have sluggishness in his personality before it occurs, but for me negligence in itself is the trigger that sets them. <br /> <br /> Cold and detached Kubrick's approach to direct handsome work for a frantic horror movie, with unpredictable force in nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters ever between making you giggle and scaring the blood out of you. When it explodes, you will not be sure how far it can go. Together they made a great team and a mix of talents gave us a classic. If you want a great look experience, then this is a good and really brilliant example ...
