For a movie that has little advertisers, and some have heard about, this was very good. It's another one of these modern-day British crime crime films ("Snatch," "animal animals," etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters. It also has a bit predictable and somewhat predictable, but early in the show - not late - some own twists make it very interesting for the first time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British boy who sends out for a "vogue order of Russia" that winds up, with the help of two Russian male friends, giving a couple of great surprises. Chaplin and Nicole Kidman co-stars, and are very good to Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Russian Kidman's Coach. This is a different type of movie and well-acting. Kidman once again proves it is far more than just a pretty face.
