When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time to tarzan. I often heard of the adult Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I would not understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's latest films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape. It was not after many years that I came across "Tarzan and his Mate," and then I understand. Weismuller is in the form of this picture and has the presence and resilience of similar demands that are not matched by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. /> As for this movie I was also amazed by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong, self-motivated, active and "no-inhibition" woman as Jane Way ahead of the times in which The movie is made (tarzan pushes it into a nude pond as it is amused; one of the explorers kisses it by surprise and even if it does not kiss it back it sort of let it do for a bit and make no great affair from it); These behaviors were the disaster and the "Janes" come as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all the sort of play of too sweet frail sweet women make it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the jungle African .. The brilliant personality O'Sullivan character steals the show from Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; The combination is perfect. Another highlight of the film is Cheeta's high roles and it's not like the main lead as in later Tarzan photo where it often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and Mate" stand as a fine product in its genre (Tarzan movie) and maybe as the best, though I have to admit that I also enjoyed "Great Tarzan Adventure "(1959) was made with a higher budget and a strong cast of support (and in spite of the only acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role and its also perfect" fitness gymnasium "looks like not fit for a rustic Monkey Man ). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her boyfriend!
