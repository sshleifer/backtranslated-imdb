I love the movies with their own comic, the comics are different then the movie but still I would give it: 10 out of 10. It was scary. If the movies were scary. I would have her baby. And I am female. It's funny you will not regret it. Yes in this movie since the artist Brian P. for his death did not find nearly as good artwork. I mean seriously do not get me wrong people have made great, but different versions for different people. Different cues for different ways as it says goes. Any guy who does not go gossip about it is crazy, or does not like women, or you know just crazy plans. If I could count on my fingers how to love and how often I read the comics I would run out of finger for sure, but hey still has toes.
