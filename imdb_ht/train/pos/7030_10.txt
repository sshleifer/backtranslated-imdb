We've stuck this when it's been broadcast on TV back in 1995 and have been waiting for all these years to drop it, so it quickly became one of our family favorites. Children are now adolescents and must have seen it at once low-zillion, but they still look at their religion with their friends. It makes timeless calls happen across all age groups - just as "Fat." Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander succulent and beautiful light on his feet. I have noticed other commentators on this site are very rough on it, but our family gives him self-assessment. (We liked her 'Giant Step' number). Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provides us with comedy relief and great music. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just flat the thief show. Probably our favorite characters in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance in Kim. Part of what to do and write. Kim's role is completely a dimension. Complete that, Philip's delivery is flat, inimaginable, incredible and just awful. The principal should see it and correct it. Or never throw it off with. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the picture is delightful and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
