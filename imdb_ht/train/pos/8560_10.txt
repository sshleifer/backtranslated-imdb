Drew Barrymore was excellent in this movie. This role is the kind of role you do not normally see Drew play. His typical role is such a woman looking for love. The scenario is also great. <br /> When Holly is involved in his mother's murder he moves to L.A. She moves in with a guy who gets her lover. But his brother in a mental prison hospital for their belief is to kill almost the accused. She is then revealing her lover that she has multiple personality disorders. And another woman becomes paranoid when she's around. At the end though, they find the truth.
