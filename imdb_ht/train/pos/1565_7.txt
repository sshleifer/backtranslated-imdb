I just saw the Saint Strike back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this one, the Saint sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club. With the help of his friend Fernak inspectors who came down from New York, they helped a daughter of a crime boss. <br /> <br /> Join Sanders at the disposal is Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br> Not a bad movie Saint. Worth to see. <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
