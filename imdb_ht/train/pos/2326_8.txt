Dani (Reese Witherspoon) was still very close to her younger sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both began to fall in love with their neighbor (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away. This was really a heartbreaking story about first love. Probably the most painful story about young love that I've ever seen. All actors are amazing and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in her first film. I would give it to the Moon at 8.5 / 10
