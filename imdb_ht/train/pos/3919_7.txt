While Carmen's afternoon bizet, Antonio Coray's in the middle-aged train carries the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) performing the lead role. Antonio fell in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman able to accept a poshive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is burning in jealousy like D. Jos√© in the original opera, enticing fiction and reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great movie of the Carlos Saura trilogy dedicated to the dance flamenco. The dramatic love story is developed and the lives of artists are entwined and the characters are recurrence, and many times it is not absolutely clear if what's happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (in the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction in this original version of the famous Bizet opera, based on the novel of Merit Prosper. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
