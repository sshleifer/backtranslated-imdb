DO NOT judge this production by the 2-week version that has been released on VHS in the U.S., which is a chop and incomprehensible chaos. I had the pleasure to watch the full 6-hour version available on DVD from the UK, and it was spellbound. The deliberate and growing sense of the threats is fascinating, as is amazing visual and landscape sculptural; this is an ancient Rome we have never seen before, and far more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was justified celebrating for his mini-series 1968 in the Odyssey, and this mini-series is equally powerful. Just as Bekim Fehmiu has become the best Ulysses screen, so Klaus Maria Brandauer may be the best Nero screen. Now, I hope one day to see Rossi's version of the Aeneid (Eneide) broadcast on Italian TV in 1971. <br /> <br /> I myself decide what version of QUO VADIS is more powerful, a this single or Polish mini-series from 2001; Each has a variety of virtues, and in many ways to complete one another. Certainly, either one tower on which Hollywood can-riot begins Peter Ustinov.
