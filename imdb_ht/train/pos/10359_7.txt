Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know he has made the pleasure of doing a lot of roles and accents, but he nails emphasis at every time. His performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspired. Ms. Chamberlain, as described here, was not particularly likable, nor smart. But just doing Streep's work is all the more remarkable. I think it is worth every 10 or so to nominate her Oscar. On the movie, well, there was a couple of interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious prejudice among the general public played a big part of the story. I was widely missed when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but it came in loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished in pursuit of misery-induced and overkill as American colleagues. A very good movie. Somewhat different. Grade: B
