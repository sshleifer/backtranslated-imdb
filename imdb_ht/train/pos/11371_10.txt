This is a truly remarkable piece of cinema success. From the very beginning I was recently hooked in the story (true) when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while doing the autopsies on the bodies of the children's bodies. This is then the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, beautifully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (the Green Mile). In fact, it plays so well and so sympathetic that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Doctor Alexandr Bukhanovsky, beautiful play by Max Von Sydow was completely credible in every detail, and the point he made when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, was all too noticeable to the behavior of communist communist communist Communist Bondarchuk by Joss Ackland . For me though, the outstanding performance came from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI was following closely and admired his work. This film puts silence in the lambs in the shade, from the atmospheric and weak Soviet landscape, to the supreme performances by everyone involved. <br /> I missed this movie 10/10
