An overlong but convincing story of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the movie is the strongest where we see the bond between the two guys, and how they help each other out, but the second half is not as strong, due to the elimination of the character of Biko. Still, it's a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington, in the movie that puts the letter on the map. Washington has also been nominated for the best actors for the first time. In general, a well-made film that could be taken down a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
