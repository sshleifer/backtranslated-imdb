I've seen just about all Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and fascinating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me! <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and the sweet, caring friendship. That's what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings of the movie perfectly. But the characters are the brightest point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> Now let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (and English aboard). While the English dub is good (especially), it simply blends in comparison with the original version of the language. Their voice is the best, dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and listening) the movie as it was originally.
