Corny! I love it! Corny - as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt reclaim the same chemistry on screen that never seems to have left! They re-live old memories, plus the actors who play in the 1960s show some of the rear-scenes that are quite interesting to know. The 1960s TV was Carnival achievement for many of us back then and this DVD is no exception, if you're familiar with the original TV show. The scene of fighting with the Boats is written with Bams or whichever is fantastic! The movie theater scene shows clips of the villains that have passed away. At the end of Frank Gorshin make an appearance. He passed away not too long after this DVD was made, I believe, so it's his great credit that he came back again to play a wicked Adam and Burt, as he did Batman & Robin many years ago. He did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar to resume a crucial role, too. In conclusion I think that this DVD is great memories, and I wish to thank both Adam and Burt to come back and recreate those memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks, guys !!!
