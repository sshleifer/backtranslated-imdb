I said that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to, now, see it in a sitkon and I really hope that a TV station will show this movie movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. See how we watched it now on Sabrina for now 5 years and so give the viewers a taste of the many talents it used to be a plus. Melissa plays her role well in this her parents want to "do away" and so she can and the guy she likes. Something that every spectator Sabrina will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher in this well before she took the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be their own kind to see this now every time it gets revealed again. Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more movies, sort of like Kellie Martin has always been shining on TV movies. Many of the talent remains waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you shine still Melissa !!!
