I was very interested to see this movie when it first came out of the theater, however, I could not get around it. So, finally, he hit the shelves, and I picked it up. By knowing exactly what to expect, I plopped the dvd into the player, staying in for an evening of murder, and pressed play. What was followed was one of the most committed cops I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> * KERMO SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the gems gentlemen, which led to the seediest parts of LA and straight to the biggest start of porn in 70 la, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> I was hooked from the beginning, with the feeling of the film that kept me all the way until the end without a lot of blood. I was surprised to find that the movie focuses less on the current crimes and more about the events before and the investigation after. Aside from an uncontrolled wall at the beginning, with the actual show of the killers towards the end, the film was more or less a commitment to engaging in great dialogue with great acting. Val Kilmer all but sells me as a junkie porn star, and even "lovely but that's it" Bosworth was a joy to look (and just to look it, your mind) <br /> I personally felt the best Aspects of the film were, as I mentioned, its lack of outright showing the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not fully see the brutal bludgeoning leaning on the sleeping court. In addition, the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to appetite my appetite. They were beaten with lead pipes, there's not much that need to be said. <br /> <br /> My only problem was Carrie Fisher's brief appearance. His portrait of the overly-religious figure was, I think, a bit clich√© in his appearance. Perhaps that person was actually part of the story, perhaps not, but I was not selling, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a bit too "akward" in his painting. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent movie is worth the look, though once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
