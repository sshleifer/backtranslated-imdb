TCM is keeping me awake all the time ... to keep coming up with my movie never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very early film by Visconti !! ... wow ... Italian version of Postman Still two rings of ... brilliant !! very well acting and directing ... Never heard of either the excellent drive, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially, Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! Watching her was in front of her time ... many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by her ... it would be a great world wide world !! The movie is better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less glossier than the MGM version (which I really like) and John Garfield and Lana Turner remember that white outfit? who can forget .... this Italian version is different .. yet realistic with a very different finish ... see it look it ... I'll buy it !!
