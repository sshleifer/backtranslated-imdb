I saw this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really loved was not an action movie or a comedy. So in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or there was really something in that movie. My surprise, the movie was held at every one of my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the good amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explained why I did not remember it was a music) and all of a great use of my time. I was surprised because the recent movies in my childhood that I had reviewed did not even spend my minimal demands in a decent film and yet this movie, which I saw first in the second grade, made me cry today to just like she made me cry then. Perhaps this is because my dog ​​has died lately and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that with the money, of course). Yes, there is continuity of glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
