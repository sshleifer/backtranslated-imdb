Ernst Lubitsch contribution to the American cinema is enormous. Her legacy is an exceptional group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with the "Shop Under the Corner". This film was remade into less distinguished movies with a musical theater, without charm or elegance in its own Lubitsch own, and definite versions. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. The characters of this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a bloody movie almost appear to be acting at all. Both are delightful stars as the pancakes that do not know each other, but that fate brought them together in the same shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic films worked well Studded amazing studio studios are put together in pictures after photo. In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the store. Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, to make impressive work to convince us that they are in Budapest. That's why these films live forever!
