I saw this film many times and I must say, I enjoyed it every single time. This is Belino's pinnacle film in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so likable and identified with the common person that you can not help but participate as you start watching. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some already being great, and others were just getting started. It's billed as a good movie feel, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always so bad after all. Sometimes you just have to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're watching it, you'll appreciate things you have a lot more and you're also smiling. You can not ask for more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention it in a hilarious movie and you will never lose interest. Very very filthy movie here. <br /> Rating from me: 10 I'm out!
