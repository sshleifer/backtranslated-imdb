In another Hare-raisingly wacky bug bug, the famous work * works in a department store case, when Gildersleeve owner decides to fix his stuff. Of course, this proves almost impossible, as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to breed-dress). As always, they keep everything coming to top speed, and so you must ask how hilarious this cartoon should look like it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how the Looney Tunes look at the '40s before the Polys Territory Territory. But do not get me wrong, the designs were still really good after the refined shapes happened. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great one. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares.
