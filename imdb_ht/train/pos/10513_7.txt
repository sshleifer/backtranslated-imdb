If you have any signs of Jane Austen's production, you'll now be repeating the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made in her novel are a bit boring, but I love Austen characters, because they all have a certain personality and their typical love words repeat as well in Emma. The good thing that Emma is Gwyneth Paltrow, is very good in his leading role. Also the fact that every one of the characters in the movie does not seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married to make the hilarious movie.
