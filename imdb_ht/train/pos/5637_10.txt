I would just like to say that I saw this movie twice now and I love it! The act is great and even though it is a scheme that looks like "Raise Your Voice" I think the plot never gets bored for those who love this kind of thing. He has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do nothing if we try. An incredible movie. I'm sure this is one I'll look for for a long time to come. Even though Britney Spears writes the book is quite a realistic plot, maybe not on the party falls in love, but the party on being different with difficulty but the best out of the end is very true in real life. Only the minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films still nice? Do you really think that Holly would have met the perfect guy in his dreams if he was ugly or mean? I doubt it
