I was amazed at the improvements made in an animated movie. If you sit near the screen, you will see the details of the grass and surface structure. Details, colors, and shadows are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. How could they crawl over the shadow, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary about how the film was produced so I can find out how all this was accomplished. Based on this film, I think animated film in the future will be judged on the basis of this film.
