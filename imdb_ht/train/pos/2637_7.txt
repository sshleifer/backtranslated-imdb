This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it will not rival the first king of lions, but that said, this was downright good. <br /> <br /> My kids love this, but this is a giving, they love anything in a cartoon. The great concussion was that I * liked it too, laughing loudly in some parts (even jokes fart *), was rather creative rather than the tie-ins and the first movie, and even some jokes You've got older ones to understand (but without risking as in Shrek ["Do you think it's a compensation?"]). <br /> <br /> A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just to sound toilets (in fact there was almost no noise / imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle ), they actually had a setup / punchline / etc, and they were almost in good taste. I would like my kids to think that there's more humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in what they consider. <br /> <br /> Hmm what else? The music was so-not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but lots of fun for kids. There is no momentous blooming moment, which was a blessing to me. A little action, but nothing is too scary (The secret of NIMH gave my children's nightmare, not sure a GG was appropriate for one ...) <br /> At all I would say this is a great films for kids at any age, one in 100% safe to let them look (I try not to be overly sensitive but I've got to jump up and close the TV during a few movies that were less kid proper than expected) - but you are safe to leave the room during this one. I would say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)
