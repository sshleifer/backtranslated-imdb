Sniper that gives a true new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or WWII, many shooting, all dead, bom bom. "Sniper" takes a war to a new level or review. The movie certainly conveys all the emotions it aims to - The helplessness of the jungle, the hatred and confidence of confidence between Beckett and Miller, and the Rush at this time when they pull off the trigger. A seemingly low-budget film makes up for every defect and action, suspense, and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one killing.
