This was the best movie in Muppet I've seen ever! I realized that the Fantasy Piggy at meeting as baby was the cause of baby Muppet. The songs will remain in my head for ever. Only say so because that stupid Nickelodeon shows Hey Dude songs still remain in my head. Sorry, a little bit of the subject. But whatever I like is Animal after credit says "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Hasta Luego!" This makes me laugh it hard. My absolute favorite is the end to play. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters popped in to the wedding. I just liked this movie was very fun. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can not keep copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I proclaim this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
