Envy is not as funny as I thought it would initially be, but after some of the comments I read I found it to be much funnier than those who gave it the props, now it's not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but Ben stiller and black jack work well with each other and christopher walken is as well as ever, so the story is about black Jack's character inventing a spray that makes pooh disappear, obviosly ben want no Part of it, but when the product does Jack Black Ben Ben Stiller begins to see the jealousy, it's not great by all means with both batons and jack nuts have funnier and better movies under the belt, but if you're a fan of either I recommend this as it's still a humorous movie and I laughed my donkey quite a few times, as a big fan of Ben Ben bench said this is a younger stiller but still great fun, give him a look
