Hitchcock was of the opinion that the hearings were not really interested in what set the protagonists in danger - only that they are in danger and they need to escape. This movie proved Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when it is clearly not. Trevor Howard decides best of course in action is running for it. So the body of the movie has our charisma park dodging over and over trains, buses and coaches - jumping across rocks at the top of a cascade - scrubbing across the street roofs. <br /> <br /> All good things are interesting - but I could not get out of my mind that it was all necessary. They should stay put. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin was not strong enough.
