This is a fantastic first and foremost series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a big big WWII button, I learned a lot from seeing this series. One of the best things that will be for him is all the interviews with the past people when the war was relatively cool in their mind, comparatively speaking is. It's nothing against the guys that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it's just that most of these guys have not really participated in the top up of what's happening then. One of the best parts is narrated by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about WWII, but really think only the dead-hards (like myself) will want to buy this or watch it over once. My only complaint about this whole series is that some of the information is not quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain in all places. This information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR. In general a fascinating look at WWII and one must see for any serious WWII professional or personal historian alike.
