A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid illustration of a land deeply divided into itself (for more evidence, check some of the comments on IMDb ...!). Compare very favorably to Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is primarily a thorough examination of Fidel Castro's hair). I do not know if Chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another of the long lines of populist Latin-American "caudillos". I do not know whether it will be able to make good on the big expectations it has been clearly built among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect a movie like this to be able to answer these questions - but I certainly now got a very clear idea of ​​what's at stake, and it feels like they are caught in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the movie "We're doing stories," and that's exactly what the movie feels like it's captured. Outstanding thing.
