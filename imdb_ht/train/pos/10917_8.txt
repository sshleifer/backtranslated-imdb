I just managed to get caught in the celestial region 3 DVDs of the five Venoms and what a super job was doing in it. A fantastic digital transfer transfer and a must have for any fan kung fu. <br /> The story is pretty straightforward, and it's been mentioned already that I will not go into it again. Needless to say it's the battle scene that many buy the movie for, and do not disappoint. The only problem is they are a few few and far between and seem to be repetitive. Bruce Lee was able to take so much on them and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with all the important "type of writers" clicks and when "Whooshes", which is a cool but fun thing! <br /> I give this movie a B +. Well, but not great. In a way I feel it could be that bit better. Golden Swallow, not the director even a decade earlier, had as good a story and action best.
