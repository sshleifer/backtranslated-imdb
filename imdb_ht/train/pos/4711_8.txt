Oh, what fun is here! Amy Heckerling has a Flair for Acting Comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who Speaks) but here it seems he told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton breezes the role of Johnny, easily performing his best screen. Joe Piscopo is great as well as Danny Vermin, what a shame director did not pick up on that. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moroni with the unique vocabulary character. I do not think it is an accident that is the bulk of the MORON spell character. <br /> <br /> The good lines are pouring into the movie, along with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gives good line. Even actors and minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good line. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
