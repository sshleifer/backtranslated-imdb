Several years ago the Marine held a distance away from doing "Honor Men," a movie based on their experience in the first black master's masterpiece of service this service to overcome virulent racism. Ever wanted to support the film that shows the best of our Navy Navy Navy and the two helicopter attackers, with the shelter of supporting shelves, was supplemented by this engrossing story of a naval battle and uncontrollable rage. Some of the films were shot down by the US. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! a obviously bright man is encouraged to allocate to the Belleau Wood USS (LHA-3), an attack helicopter platform. Fisher can not seem to avoid launching its own assault in minimal provocation from his fellow enrollment. Sending to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation procedure, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, reveals a terrible child of great negligence and brutality. <br /> The story develops as Fisher cautiously, but increasingly believes her doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, a sailor who has enrolled Cheryl, played by a charming Bryant Joy. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly engaged and the doctor does not ask time ever but soon realized he should look for answers, however painful, to grow and to move away from conflict that seek destructive behaviors. While all the main black characters, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of dubious religions and hypocrisy paralyzed in foster family environment. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sexual immorality but is nothing compared to foster mothers, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who is in short but searing scene - he existed - Oscar for jus-churning brutality. The film on interaction by patient-therapists follows a certain predictability (all that is transferred to contrary-transferring things) but seriously in Fisher and his / her counselor is realistically adomic. It's a good story, well said. Period. While wearing the marine, "Famous Fisher" is not in any real sense a service story like "The Honor Man," an excellent film that has been faced with crushing racism directed against a real person. Nor is it really a movie about black. It's about experiencing survival experiences of terrible children and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim to adult victims is still "standing tall." Prosecutors shrug in size and meaning as a brave young man and strongly claim his rights to a decent life with the help of a caring physician. <br /> <br /> My only burden is that Washington is a commander of the elite but is referred to as commander. With all those who support the Marines listed in their credit, one should tell the Washington Director that his character, like all the naval officers below the commander, addresses as "Mister." Not a great criticism, is it? :) <br /> I do not know why this movie is playing in some theater. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke can well find an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
