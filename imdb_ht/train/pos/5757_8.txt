This film could only be the origin of the 1970s! It is a rare acting movie set in a small town in the city of California. There are some sort of mills or plants that are locked down, so suddenly, rampant bad behavior occurs in the streets! Citizens are eating up! So, Ben Arnold (John Michael Vincent), went to another town to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnamese Vet resembling a little balance. It hangs out with a bunch of other veteran vet fans. They went into the town to clean it (to become deputy), but under their good deeds, they actually run home gambling, ask for protection funds, etc. !!! It took a while for people to catch on, and in a confirmation of Cain and Abel Abel, Vincent took on his older brother. There's an interesting blue-collar atmosphere in this film, which makes it interesting (note the blow-fighting scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role ?? he thinks so much of his brother, he can not conceive of him committing the wrongs he has accused of. It finally came to sense it ?? His girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back & she even beats up in her home. Christ Kristofferson is very effective as Aaron. She refuses to refuse to do evil, and even slowly and speaking to Vincent's teenage daughter (she refers to her as 'Aaron's Uncle') even while she threatens her father's life, while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good to compare chemistry with one another. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a girl 'saloon' that attracts Aaron's attention. This is the movie action bon 70, if you can get it !! It is not available on DVD anymore ??
