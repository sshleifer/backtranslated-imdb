This is a wonderful movie about the struggle of Mormons and the final rules of Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and ending are especially powerful, and the message is one we all must remember - God does not speak, but he communicates, if we only listen. As I wrote this in the midst of the horrors going to New Orleans and the surrounding area due to Katrina, I was mostly moved by the Mormons who left everything behind them and moved on after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this land to save religious persecution, and yet they could not. The struggle of Mormon to cross the country, the cost of life, the suffering suffered was truly awe-inspiring, demonstrating the tremendous forces. As far as the current beliefs of Mormons, this is not heavy into, and polygamy mentioned, but not a trail of the entire movie. <br /> The cast is top-notch, though others have commented more about the real characters and can talk about how true portraits were. But as actor, Dean Jagger, Mari Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell all made excellence with the script being given. Even though the film could easily stand on its own (and certainly does today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell added to the cast to get the crowds in the movie theaters to see a movie about the Mormons. Power is splendidly beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, as Zina, is not a Mormon but staying on with the family after his father dies. Power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when it's a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of the filming) are even less, even if they make a cute couple. The fate is left clear on his conversion, and one asks about poligami in their case. You can not beat either one for eye candy, however.
