Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high school tour but rather than hacking on the incident itself the film shows the consequence and what happened to the survivors, trauma, guilt and refusal. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Fired in itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action action other than the reaction of a fast SWAT commander after shooting high school killer. The film has three protagonists; The detective investigates the crime that no guilty party has left convicted of two girls who survived the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing in common to shoot them together because of it and the indirect drama. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, though only 24 was around the block so much that movie viewers are pretty much acquainted with with its strong and earnest style of acting. Occupying Filips, three years older than Christensen and all unknown to me, blown me away with his overwhelming dramatic strength and presence of screens. This girl was the party. <br /> It's a great movie and it connects with you and its intimate focus on the brittle relationship again growing between the two traumatized girls. The Gus van Sant Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and brutal compared to home rooms when it comes to dramatic and acting flair. What I can see this film has very little screen and display - for much more a loss for an American traumatized. <br /> <br /> Ten Ten From Ten
