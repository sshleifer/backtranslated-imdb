I thought the kids at the show did a good job. I especially enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Well done! The cascades were very good for a low budget show. I could follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at me every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth and burn in it. The ghost revelations of children's soul being released were also good. Another good point in the movie is that he keeps moving together. There was not much slowing scene. Adult driving was also credible and therefore helped keep the entertaining show. All in all one night enjoyable in watching movies.
