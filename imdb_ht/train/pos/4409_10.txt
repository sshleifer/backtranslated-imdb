This movie is one of the sleeps of all time. I gave it a rating 10. The story is in the 'Famous Bushwhackers' from Missouri who fought on the South side during the war between the United States. The clothing they wear was authentic, the story and why they fight is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as shown ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well disposed and were either the most brilliant actor or the director really know how to get the best of them. I suspect it was a combination of great LEDs, super filed to find the right people and excellent performers by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really frozen! It has stocks, romances, suspicions, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and stories all rolled into one movie. Even there are Spiderman in the future and jewelry. And it's good!
