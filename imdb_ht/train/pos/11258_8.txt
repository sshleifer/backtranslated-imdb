Spoilers! Classic 70's litter! The Swedish Gal (Helga) is what made this movie so great. He was beautiful, but what really happened to me was how sexually he was. She examined massive amounts of sexuality throughout the movie. The best scene he was when he was, he, exciting himself. Every time he was on the screen, I became transfixed. <br /> <br /> Also, Julia's doctor (sister of dimwitted male focus in the movie) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have breast milk than Julia, she knew how to use what little she had and her scene (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt) Grab my attention unprecedented. You also liked the great angry scene where the strips strip off its nectar; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more sexy yet sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
