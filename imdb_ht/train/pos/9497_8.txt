Absolutely fantastic garbage ... this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosion etc. It also Belinda Mayne's beautiful star as Ingrid - by Olga as the other criticized to point out - although Olga becomes Ingrid Later in the movie (you'll have to watch her to see what I mean). <br /> I will not bother to go through the story as it's far too long reversed and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and his brother (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the towel stolen to see what I mean. The fighting scene was at once quite good and then spoiled by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were made by the team that made the Dead City Walk (meaning unusual colorless gushing out of course injuries). <br /> I would advise fans of low budget lending to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty bizarre though and I could never see anyone bothering to re-drop it for it become all the rarity in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway I would recommend it only to Belinda Mayne's big naked scene! This lady is a fox!
