True, the idea for this TV series could have been out of the immense success that Ally McBeal is enjoying worldwide, even here in Germany. However, this is said, Edel & Starck are very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> Two main characters work very well together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by well-known German actor, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, find it ???), played by good Rebecca Immanuel, rapid exchange of romantic repetition and still spies each other while engaging in site-like criminal cases in Berlin and the environment. Further, they will be assisted by a magnificent cast of co stars, most notably the secretaries, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a rare gem and potential GREAT potential. Also, the Shady Wheeler-dealer, otto, and the noble fingertips of Felix, Frank, works very well, remembering Sandra's best friend and couple-room, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. All-in-all a happy to look at Monday nites: not surprising that the series and its stars got several prizes. Will Felix receive Sandra? <br /> I hope we will have to wait for many more episodes to get ...
