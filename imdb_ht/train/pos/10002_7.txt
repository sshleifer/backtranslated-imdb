This is the easiest movie of the most underrated Canon Brooks. Make sure it's flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane has provided a realistic view of room makers, or Titanic has provided a realistic view of Italian or IDIOTS). Many of the jokes are falling flat. But still, this movie is very adorable in many ways not comedies, and pulls that off of a story about some of the most traditionally riotous members of society is truly impressive. It's not the Fisher King, but it's not crap, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should throw someone else from the lead (I like Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead).
