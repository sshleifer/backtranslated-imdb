I can not believe that now this film is rated a 6.9. Anyway, this film was probably one of the most touched Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed the traditional family cinema. As for the story I thought it was great it was about shahid capur that was set up on a row wedding with amrita rao. It is kind of a happy go guy guy type, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very useful to her uncle, but the only problem is her cousin does not seem to get so much attention as she does what she likes Amrita adventure with a passion. This embarrassing Amrita because he just wants his tent to love her. It was also very much touched to see that although the Amrita family was not wealthy maybe just middle class at lower grades, while Shahids families were quite upper classes, they always treated their families with respect and did not even ask Put them down that really hit a nerve with me. This is because I've actually seen people being very rude to those who are not as good at thinking below their standards that I feel very deep. This movie showed that family wardrobe wanted to see the great values ​​that Amrita brought up and turned blind in the fact that she was not a wealthy business tycoons business or anything. All of this film deserves an 8/10 I wish more and more of these kinds of movies being made.
