......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not) than prettier women, but it (was) a new topic for Bollywood. The subject was accepted, but it is far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, the subject is presented in a clean way. But the plot has its number in the globe. The beginning of the movie is featured in a very "filmed" way. Some holes draw a lot. The movie chooses once Rani has miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a normal movie. Otherwise, all family members felt late at the beginning. The act could not have been any better. Salman Khan is sometimes impressed, and sometimes lets you down. Over here she gave one of the best performances. On top of that role she writes so well, that you cheer every time she resolves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she has been covered by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is perfect picture. From the three, it gives everyone a run for their money. It's surprising how it can be as compulsive when it's innocent. With my confidence, Madhubala is far from your next girl. This is one of the reasons why I missed it high. Throw in their support as the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning in the draw yet I get them tolerated here. Singing is very nice. The title song is my favorite of them all together with Dil Terra Mera Dil (Heart). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekon Walon Ne (See the Eyes of the World) are two songs that fit the movie perfectly. Number cabinet cabinet, Diwani Diwani (crazy), could have been shortened while 1 Punjabi came through boring even though it was good to dance. Otherwise the film is definitely worth a look.
