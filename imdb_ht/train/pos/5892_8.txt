Thomas Ince always had a talent to bring simple homespun history into life with Pleller and Flair. The "Italian" is like a movie. Solid actors, particularly by George Beban, father of child actor George Beban, Jr., and beautiful arrays convey a realistic sentiment to early immigrants early in New York. These 1915 films show an authenticity that is unusual in the feature of this ancient. The movie begins with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) read a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we transition to the story with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to lead his fianc√© in Italy to America, to marry him, and have a son with him. But times are difficult and family struggles to survive. I found myself asking why the mother did not breastfeed her child, and avoiding hassle with the formula of the room, but oh well, even the factory dreams prompted incorrect behavioral policy for women in 1915! The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in prison, and at the last minute he decided against his planned course of action. Very clean. I liked the curtain effect, it was great. Beautiful lighting use of this movie. <br /> I give the "Italian" an 8 out of 10.
