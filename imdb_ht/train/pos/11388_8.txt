If I recall, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and George George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this movie and it was broken up by the producers. In great respect, it was a 50 typical film music at the Freed Unit of MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli and a lot of help from Gene Kelly. The Gershwin was, of course, among the greatest of all Broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers, periods !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the youngest two male dancers in the movie music (One guess as the other?) And I do not imagine he'd dropped it ever in doubt. But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a personality noted in his time and, as a current friend of George Gershwin, he was to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderate talented composer as well as a neurotic and hypocondriallic note and here, as always, he plays himself. Leslie Caron was an unknown at that time and was in French "gamin" style. A talented dancer, it's never a real beauty. George Guetary who plays part of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French but he certainly is more than OK as a French Boulevard, though a little too small for the party. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Though Gene was better to throw elsewhere as, obviously, to "singin 'in the rain" where her character is more calculated, even here she shows herself to be something of a heel at times (She , not for nothing, cast as original Joey heel in Pal Joey, the Broadway music.) I did not enchant with the stage "I got rhythm" with the kids who do not appear as spontaneous as intended in my opinion. also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be rather irritating. <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the movie based on the title music and sets and costumes in the styles of great French imitation painters. <br /> I found it hard to believe Gene and Oscar, as a challenging artist, and I do not think that the music numbers are as well set up as they might but, on balance, is the Gershwin music very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well-done with clear graphics clearly (when suppos ed to be) and the mono sound is a good thing, but a wasted valley.
