Do not waste my reading review time. Go out and see this amazingly good episode, which can very well be the best kolonbo ever written! Ruth Gordon perfectly threw as mystical writer the good mystery who killed his son-in-law to deal with his murder of his daughter. Columbo is its usual rumpled, befuddled and far-intelligent-than-it-looks self, with this particular feature featuring fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by creator Announcing Levinson or Link again is possibly the density, the best original and twist-charged colonboards ever. Utterly meets in almost every department and overflows with horrible and slow dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and inventing the highest score. 10/10 ... seek this one out on Netflix!
