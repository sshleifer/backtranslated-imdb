I saw this film in the theater, and was impressed by it. Then again, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not crazy, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch it is today. Anyway, this movie really hit me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful films. How far would you really go for your best friend? I moved in tears at the end, and it was still torn when I watch it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and skipped how much I loved it. This is a great movie to watch with your best friend. However you must prepare for the almost certain conversation afterwards and come back to you and ask if you would do something like that for her ....
