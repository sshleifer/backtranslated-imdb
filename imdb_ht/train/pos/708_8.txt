An ok movie on syndrome downs. A mother has twins one very sick the other is good but she has Downs. Mom does not think she can lift her so she gives to some people 15 children 11 have Downs! The mother does not like this & she thinks it should be with her family (agree to too) to take her to the court & the family gets broken up & the grandparents lost, she never really said if the brand and daughter makeup? I think this good movie, but the draw is unfamiliar, it's always good & there is a few unintentionally laughter!
