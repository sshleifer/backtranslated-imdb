********* Ten from Stars Stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this was a made for TV movie. Just the phrase, "made on television", made me tremble. The production values ​​for television movies are almost always considerably lower than production value for professional film studio. That being said, this version of "Carol Christmas" would be released in the theater, because it is that good. It's my personal favorite of all the "Christmas Carol" movies because all aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are few miners on screen glitches and two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is not a movie of existence that does not have at least a couple of mistakes. a stellar performance as Scrooge, it is a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can not think of one performance in this film that should not be applauded. Costumes, where shooting, and winter series are mesmerizing. The music note is endearing and heartwarming. Add to that, solid LEDs, unprecedented movies, and scripting loyalty; We have here that one day will be considered a classic holiday. It really has not been around long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. This film has become a Christmas annual tradition in my home because it defines the true meaning behind Christmas: Love, despair, and giving. In selfishness, vicious world, my family and I can lose myself in the "Carol Christmas", starting with George C. Scott.
