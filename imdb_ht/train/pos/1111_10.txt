This is not "so bad that it is good," it is purely good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intelligence of a four year old (in response to a certain comment ...) Anyways, kittens eating kittens France is a parody of himself, a parody of you, and a humorous imitation of me. It is the only pure engineering text in Cinemas history. I have read and three prequels sitting on my DVD shelf next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It defines absurdity recognition and weakens all you or I call standards. I write scripts and this movie one-handedly open up a genre of comedy for me, the love that we have never seen. It can only be taken into the portion of it ... it's sort of explosive ... by now I'm just trying to take the ten minimal lines. My comments ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it right now.
