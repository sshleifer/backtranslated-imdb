For anyone who likes the movie series will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you want more. I loved the way that each (detective) character had an appearance. The youngest and the end of which is the fourth chair to leave a reason for another movie. I guess is Bayless of course. This as the series was a very well put together series of scenes. This is a series I wish lived on. Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV.
