I read a little on Che before watching this movie and wanting to know something, it was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and he hated that oppressive force did his people as well as all other Latin American in general! Now, I do not know about others, but for me he has done the right thing does not want socialism for everyone to have paid their fair share. However, the elite powerful obviously did not want to go for that. So, rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in trying to suppress the revolution. He did not work since there was too much of his other followers who only pick up where he left. A good example was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as I'm concerned and as she says she herself right before she dies: "If you kill me, that's fine. But you only kill a man, you will never kill the cause!" I could not tell him any better myself. <br /> But ... ANYWAY .... That's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
