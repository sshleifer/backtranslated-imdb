I saw this film 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's Birthday and was shown this movie as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since. I took interest in seeing this movie because one of the stars is Jim Dale's very funny and talented as Lusty Sailor. I believe Dale now makes narratives in the Harry Potter books on Casette, but anyway it is quite funny. This is a fast paced comedy. It's not about VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go to the movie collections and consider restoring and releasing this DVD movie. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite funny as the Ramble seabed. This is a humorous comedy, the kind of movie one does not see yet, with great production value. *** 1/2 stars from ****
