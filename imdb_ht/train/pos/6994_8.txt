Bela made 9 pics for monograms, but it was only in this one, 4th, that things started to come together. All the rest of the series would use this one as the essential model for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series would also deal with one essential term: a scientist (usually Bela) to experience the basement or the old house (sometimes the basement of the old house ) that causes things to go blooey. This was also the first time that Art Director Dave Milton received a chance to spread his zeal. He came on board for Dark DRAGONS, the previous flicker, but one place he came to start his craft to click on. Lewis made great atmosphere for nothing, and was around for the rest of the monograms. Distribution is the key of these, and it is a very good B one movie of wisdom, here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from black dragon), along with Russell, who would star in Lewtons' CAT people cinemas .. and Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice slice of Talent Row talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this one ... it sums up everything they've learned up to this point, and gives you something to compare the rest. The plot? Bela thieves juice juice caught her nasty girl. They both love to sleep in coffins. If you can read this with smile, the rest will be easy.
