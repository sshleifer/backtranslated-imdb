Because of all the negative reviews of this movie I almost did not look at it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that he was a leisurely supporting player. The act was not great - apart from Alice wonderful wonders - but some of the dialogue ("Just consider yourself lunch.") Was quite fun. <br /> <br /> All over the above average King King effort - 7/10.
