This film is light, funny, and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely superb, and the colors are convincingly reminder of Vermeer paintings. This is sentimental comedy in its best way higher than US and French standards, and arguably better than English as well. <br /> <br /> Each character is touched, and interpretation is near perfection. Isabelle Blais is splendid, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, St√©phane Gagnon is good, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in this unusual role in him, and Genevieve Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> I could go about hours before you get any negative comments about this movie, so give it a chance, and add your own review.
