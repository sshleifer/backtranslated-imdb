Reda is a young Frenchman in Moroccan descent. Despite her Muslim legacy, she is very much French in attitudes and values. From the blue, his father announces that Reda will drive him to the Hajj (Pilgrimage) in Mecca - something that Reda has no interest in doing but agrees solely from obligations. As a result, from the outset, Reda is angry, but is a traditional Muslim man, his father is hard to talk and discuss his misery. Both father and son seem very rigid and supple - and it's very ironic when the father tells his son that he would not be so stubborn .. When I read the summary, he talks about how many characters have grown and began to know each other. However, I really do not think that was done and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there was time of understanding, but so often had a undercurrent of hostility and repression. I actually liked this and appreciated that there was no complete resolution - as it would have seemed phony. In general, the film is well-acting and fascinating - giving Westerners an unusual insight into Islam and the Hajj. He also provided a fascinating juxtapose of traditional Islam with the exclusion of the lesser generation. While the slow speed and the lack of clear on the relationship throughout the movie can be annoying some, I think it has given the film real intense and make it look like a movie about people - not some formulas. A beautiful and unusual movie.
