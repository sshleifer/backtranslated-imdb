Four words against why this movie was done - "He did it wrong". The great commercial success of this machine Mae West convinced the studio bronze that Melodrama Gay 90s was a solid proposal. Here we are rewarded with a fast moving, well-written writing that neatly targets the personality of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Boats are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take, but it's Wrath Fray who steals the movie with her stock-in-stock girl in distress. With a strong director - as Walsh proved himself to be - Wray could bring a lot of punch, and it is utterly credible as the object of both Raft and Beery's affections. Many of the atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten movie worthy of revival.
