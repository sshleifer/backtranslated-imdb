Well now, this was certainly a surprise episode. In this science sciences science series, with all these strange, incredibly extraordinary and many bros and the generic, this episode would certainly rate as normal. Its seemingly insignificant options apparently do not give any moral to the end of the story. Or does it? Kikin off with the Silent Shapes movie, there is no dialogue recording, but there are music accompaniments. In this case it's on the sound track, not used to play in Organ or Piano by a musician on sight. This part of the episode, along with the ending section, also made use of Liberal use of Card titles, as well as the "Old Movies Time." While these titles are somewhat exaggerated and transferred, they did so intentionally with a affection rather than any contempt for the Silent Film. <br /> <br /> Veteran Comedy Film Director, Norman Z. McLeod, was the man in the chair for this half-hour installation. He was the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, featuring people like Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. He was not a stranger on TV, as he did much to work on TV Series. <br /> It does not appear that he and Mr. Keaton have ever worked together (as I can not find any evidence) ', but judging by the outcome of the movie, they succeed in doing so with flying colors ! Anyone who led Keaton knew that Buster was also a fine commander director as well as a comedy player. It was just as comfortable behind the camera as it was in front of it. Short partnerships must have been a harmonious one, and 'give and take' about how to do things. It is that many of the gags were the Keaton, resurrected from its silent day days. For example, the gage set the pair of pants on the Rollo (Stanley Adams assistance made by Keaton and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle at one of the Arbockle 2 Reelers, the GARAGE (1919). It was a clear example of his craft 'In a nutshell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! .It is a Cardinal Card for her film .Waste the White Man 's old man' Maytag Repair, was little and once again full - full of veteran talent Stanley Adams was Rollo and served as Mr. Keaton's right-wing leader, has arranged the fixing of the fixed 'HJelmet Tan' Gil Gil, a serious veteran of the RKO Short Comedy series, was Copen in 1890. James Flavin, George E.Stone, Harry Fleer, Warren Parker, and Milton Parsons all swing this is largely silently cast. <br /> <br /> Without reversing the weights, let's just say yes, there's probably a lesson to be learned here .. to mention, "The grass still looks greener on the other side of the fence!", Then how about, "Be careful of what you ask, because you just can get it!"
