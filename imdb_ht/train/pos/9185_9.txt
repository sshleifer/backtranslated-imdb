DOUB exposure was a big surprise. It includes outstanding acts (particularly in the underrated Callan), fine cinematography and a compelling scenario. In other words, it's one of the finest horror efforts from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of killing her models, at a time when she is assembled with her psychologically volatile (who is going to be missing a leg with a leg) . When the Callan dreams about models actually risen, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he sees. This movie has never been praised. Most critics and filmgoers sink it in with the slasher movie horde released at the same time, but it stands high above much of this much regret. It's smart and unique, which is not something someone can be uncomfortable to say about this movie's genre, but it's also enthusiastic to manufacture and celebrate. DOUB display is a gem of its kind.
