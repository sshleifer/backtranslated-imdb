I love Sabrina! One of my shows shows !! My favorite episodes; one in which she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest comes from the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as high school but they were better than the last series that was terrible. Valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and seemed to have no explanation for where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as other friends.
