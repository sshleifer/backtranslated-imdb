I'm 60 years old, a guitarist, (lead / rhythm), and over the past forty years, I've been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the mob-ups, the rotten food, The worse settlement, always traveling, little or no money, and everyone was drunk or high. But the clubs, fans, and the music, made it all worth it! Just like weird Fruits! I'm too damn old for it now, and the arthritis in hand and hips means there is no more rocking, but for the length of video, it's all back, and it's all there! The birds, the brawls, and the bottle! And I was young again! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice about God's love of the 70's! Rock on all ages!
