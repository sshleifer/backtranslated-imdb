The story is told fluidly. There is no interruption. The flashheads are woven into the presently seamlessly. Distribution was superb. Young Ya'ara looked very much like Ya'ara would have looked at that age. Painted in a blind man is compelling. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a superb job of finding the various actors working together in this story. The cinema is very good. You feel like you and Ya'aara and Talia walk toward the ocean at the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that though "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin" Both names are very appropriate in the story.
