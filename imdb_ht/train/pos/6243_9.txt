a movie about the wickedness of this world. I found it released, as truth can only be. It also has some quite funny bits. Some of the acting is extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for example. The director tried to describe life as soon as possible, succeeded. In addition, the sex scenes are clear and there are no more fake than those in a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understand a phrase, I've found the vision of the movie in the original language and subtitles much more rewarding, because with half of the duplication of the great actors of the lost actors. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to copy by a dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
