This movie was scary! I can not find it on his song. I think I'm a bit too old for musical, but this movie deserves some credit here, guys! My favorite favorite was Jack Wild. Me, being a British actor lover, you can not keep me from those beautiful looking-looking faces, young men. I never knew that when Jack made that his movie was sixteen! It looks like an eleven years old. It's short, that's what helps. Try to post your response, poster posters, so I can relate to your experience. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, guys, Bill Sikes, I think drone look is really familiar. Any idea where he starred in the past? If so, post it up, I would really like to know.
