Although it is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most famous stars in the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a perky personality and a very-admired voice song. This 1937 was his first major film, and it proved a box office-bonanza for beleaguered Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART girls worry three daughters in a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen dad when they are still mother-in-law reveal she can soon remarried - with the firm intention of robbing gold- Digging her, she returned to her mother. Although the story is slight, the script is witty and driven by experts to play it with a vicious clear touch. Durbin has a pleasing voice with appealing personality, with these charming actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson, and Mischa Auer round out cast. An ultra-light entertainment for fans of the 1930's. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Review
