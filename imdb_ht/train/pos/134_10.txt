Someone released this movie on DVD so it can take place aside as in the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and movie historians look back on the so-called movie of the 1990s and see how stupid they were for the most part, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Centropa" (or "Europe" as it is referring to the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the weakness and skepticism of almost genetics that oozed from WWII post-Europe, namely desimated German landscape The physique horror has been matched only by damage to the psyche of its people. From Trier's brilliantly painted vision on the screen. You will feel like you are watching some lost classic noir spionage from the late 1940s and the scenes are perfectly lit black and white, while at the same time feel you're on the brink of something beyond the corner, especially in scenes such as the murder of the train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing evolution in an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier was caught in his own dogma movement shortly thereafter. And while it "breaks the waves" and "The Dark Dancer" is classic of their own right, it is with "Centropa" that it really awakens the art of making films in new and exciting heights. 10/10, age like a fine wine, and begs for a DVD release.
