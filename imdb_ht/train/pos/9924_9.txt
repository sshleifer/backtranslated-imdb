Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the movie world. I enjoyed the film very much because of the complicated scheme, the characters varied, and the intense camera effect. I've seen some complaints about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, flashy and wild shots, all the accumulation of errors was made in time. All you see was the desired effect. Perhaps some complain because something like this has never been done before, although that's what it sets apart. In a deeper sense, what you see is just how Domino sees things in his eyes, thinking about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, I do not see anything bad about it. Although it's "dirty" nature, according to some, it is in fact just a quick form of storytelling. The plot really is not all that hard to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see movies from different different aspects like the act, the draw, etc. I have no "interpreter" or anyone who chooses separate movies, it just comes to me. With that said, I believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed, despite it's future as a cult-classic, blockbuster, or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, well there's no doubt how to vary the cast. I believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine works that show their characters effectively, that's what makes a movie lady with gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and one more is that you get to witness a bit of each one of their lives, putting them apart even further. Basically, I personally liked the cast and character. <br /> Everyone who hits and burns this movie maybe just not see it as I do, or it just does not appeal to them. No problem, this is a great movie of its own right, not, it's a great movie period.
