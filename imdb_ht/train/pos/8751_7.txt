Two adolescents adventures, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for a recent experience before going to college. It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic country, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them to take a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They get nabbed by local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the US <br /> <br /> This is the main primary line for "Brokedown Palace" and it was a good one. The film does a decent job of displaying arbitrary justice and corruption in the third world nation. Actually, the painting was rather severe, as prison conditions are often far worse than represent. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is primitive by comparison to many of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were too many converted situations in the film that prevented the story. All the escape attempts were fantasy. To think that friends would be able to embarrass money for a bribe in the prison in a padded bra, and they must not be discovered by the guard who systematically checked everything carried out by visitors, assuming that either the guards or the viewers is pronounced blocker. <br /> <br /> The story also fails to close the nervous question of how the drugs have been received by Claire Danes (Alice). Does it actually agree to transport the drugs? We left guess. It was intriguing to keep guessing about the girls' innocents all over the movie, but we ended the movie never really know if one or both of the girls might be guilty. Except for this considerable flaw, the finish was excellent with the unexpected results. Acting by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well-done. Danish, who was oversold and hyped, actually happened as an actor in this film. Though painting it was often frelik (as it was his character), it improved as the movie progressed and the circumstances became more dire. Beckinsale, in contrast, has flown under the radar all his short and bright career as the delicious-de-shoes that suddenly finds himself in jail. It was the best performance in the movie. <br /> Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer. Wry and diffident style it is an advantage in films such as "While You've Sleep", but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, having the wrong personality. /> Watching the tourist in Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> In general, a fun movie made plausible in part by insertion into some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10.
