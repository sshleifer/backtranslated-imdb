I thought this film was very good. Some parts have been real, but this is understandable since it has been over 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance of the movie was given by Michele Morgan who played Millie compelling. Jack Haley is also really good Mike O'Brien. Though I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good at this movie. If you have a craving for a comic, on top of the music comedy, Higher and higher is the movie for you. <br />
