This is an excellent modern-day movie noir .... "excellent" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. There are some holes in here and some jump parts that make you shake your head of disbelief ..... but I have not found anyone who did not get caught in this story. The film has the right amount of action, suspense, draw draw and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice colors and movies plus a good guitar based band. <br /> I mark this crime movie a "movie noir" because it's frustrating and all the characters are not good. Even the guy is supposed to be good, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself into trouble by lying and has a quick deal he should not have. It also does something to the end that's not good, but I'm not going to spoil it when it says. Try to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad to make cages look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys," anyone doing it better than Dennis Hopper? Not a lot. At least in the category "disrupted", it's hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to look for a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great performance to support, too. This is one of those films that have never received many advertisers, but it should have. You will have fun watching this. By the way, try to tell the name of this movie loudly three times fast without pity it up!
