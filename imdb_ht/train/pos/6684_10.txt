This is a great movie. I love reading more every time I look. Most comedians can find lovely lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men have a lot of integrity in the writing and characterization that will look once again - like Stiller's tears in the Hood Ornament of the Limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush shines its cooperation choreography, or Tom awaits mumbles while watching the news report, or Janeane Garofalo denying a kiss from Paul Reubens - is a pleasure. This is the perfect fitness fertilizer acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the sequences are creative and not too dominant, the rules are set-ups at the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a short time, watch it again, and if you do not have to then start. You can not watch it again until you saw it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, scene of tryouts. Too Good!)
