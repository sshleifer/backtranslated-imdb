Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful movie I've seen all year long. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I remember correctly, where the prisoners were repeated and doing a different Shakespeare play annually for the past 14 years. The movie follows their production of the "storm" from the performance cast, and in the process we learn some amazing things about these guys who are all for the most serious crime. Truth is true to aliens than fiction - if anyone has tried to adapt this story to a movie movie, the audience would never buy it, but know it's real to make it breathtaking to look - literally; I gasped loudly when I learned of a particularly gifted crime crime. It's like some episodes of Oz, and all the more fun because the characters and rare stories are real.
