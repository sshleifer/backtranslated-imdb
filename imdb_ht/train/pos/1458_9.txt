Sharp, well-documented documentary focuses on Mardi Gras beads. I have always loved this approach for making films - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex, and often uncritical phenomenon by breaking down the problem down to something familiar and close to the home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understanding the basic motives behind profits and capitalism, and the globalist effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). Instead of blasting on these topics and relying on a soapbox (not that there is anything wrong with that, other than documentaries such as typically preached to the convert), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras pearl, how to manufacture, not that people, and under what conditions, and then how to use by consumers at the end of the process. It openly and truly investigates the motivation of all involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> I felt a little sick of this; also by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also in the way the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and parity for the course (even though they have some objections on their details). The foot of the street sweaters cleared the beads in the streets to the end, made a particular impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else can read this documentary a little different. <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this topic, I do not think you have to have any specific political views to be affected by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you ever bought a product that was made in the Far East, it should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Exceptional and highly recommended. Need to see more documentaries like this. Kudos to all those involved in doing this movie.
