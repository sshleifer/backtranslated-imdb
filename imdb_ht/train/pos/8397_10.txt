This movie has earned every one of the ten votes I gave it! Thanks guys to make a movie worth watching. You've shown the world, you can always write, direct, produce and star in a black film without the stereotypes negatively. The poetry was awesome as well, the hats go to poets and musicians. <br /> I watched her last night, as I fell in love with my darling all over again. I'll add it to my movie collection today, and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <br /> <Thanks again, with your best wishes and blessings!
