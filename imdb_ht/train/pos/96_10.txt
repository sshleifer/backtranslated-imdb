I've reviewed some old VHS tapes I had and came across the John Denver TV show & muppets a Christmas set.This made me go to my computer and watch it to see if I could get a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed not to be able to read it on DVD. The show revealed in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the file with the CD but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tap is old and high quality photo is very good, but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also a few other songs by putting on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and at the Muppet, a DVD at this show would really be a good seller. If you do not have the CD it's a nice collection of Chritmas in the songs taken from this show. The album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on.
