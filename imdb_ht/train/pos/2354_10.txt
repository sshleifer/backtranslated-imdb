It was such a treat that then shows was over because it was such a cool, innovative, and original show. This makes every show I've ever looked look boring. The moment this episode first revealed I was intruding and I became attached to all the characters so easy (which usually never happened because I still hate a few characters). It's a pity this show will not be a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen and not exaggerated my feelings for the show all. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC possibly get to replace this show? This is easily the best show on TV. <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
