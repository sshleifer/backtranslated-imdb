I was the first time dubious about this movie (simply because of the subject), but the rich characters draw, fabulous scenes in Buffalo hunting, and the dramatic conclusions make it well worth watching. I initially had difficulty distinguishing between Buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they increasingly distinguished themselves. I'm still haunted by the final stage.
