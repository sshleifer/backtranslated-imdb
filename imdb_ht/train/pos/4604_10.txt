This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10 .. for all of you out there that rating this movie low notes because it has no "good draw" or something like that, ridiculous, saying that a movie Jackie Chan is bad because of her draw is like saying a porn movie is bad because she has no draw! you watch Jackie Chan for the battle scene, for the action he does not so much focus on a good story or something like that, if you look at how he does film and compares it to other American films in that era and even later you will realized that Jackie Chan's movies had the scenes and heads not really well during American cinemas had good scheme but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan did at the moment. Porn is look for the porn, Jackie Chan is watching for the ACTION, I think that your rating rating is bad because there is no plot because you think that how a smart movie criticism would rate a good movie but the way I see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure in the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it in this way the rest of which is full of action scenes and many demonstrations pay for all of this. This has changed the way Americans have created American movies, they have the same scene from this movie. If you want a true man, a true artist then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan, hes better in any way. It literally makes American cinema look like a walk in the park, and even in today's movies. American films depend much on special effects and security wires with double dual and many more. Police history and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true true artist who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece
