The real story (born in Kansas in 1959) in a kill (Perry and Dick, two ex-prisoners who broke into a remote home on a rainy night stolen and killed all they met). Richard Brooks directed the book's driver and disturbing Capote about the reasons that drove those children into the crime (Are Natural Cage Takes?). The crime scene is very brutal and haunting because of the lack of sense and reason for what we witness. Stunning Black & White Cinematography from Conrand Hall, Excellent Country - Road Music Notes in Quincy Jones, Amazing Performance of Two Roles of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and The First Aid in a Movie A sad comment on Capital Punishment in the past before death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as directors and screenings for adapted scenario) are award-winning academies. Cut, superbly directed and scared, one of the best films of this decade
