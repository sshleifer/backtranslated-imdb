There are many reasons why I miss the soprano so very, one of her biggest triumphs was cast and character building. Each character unfolds more and more each set. Also each set has an array of different 'short time characters' as well as the main. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes) that you can feel for is the compulsive David Gambler played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV set. The show turns round boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his life in crime and his role as father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so credible. Tony also runs things with Capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) looks for a promotion. Each episode also features Tony's other family in some ways including his children and Miss Madamela (Edie Falco). On top of these issues his uncle Junior Soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to find what he can get from Tony's business despite being under house arrest. All the acting is powerful and complex characters, but the two stand out their pies; James Gandolfini who is Tony Soprano. Also, Michael Imperioli plays Christopher, representing the younger generation (20-30) of crime. If David Chase has not created this modern-day TV drama of such calibers could not exist, such as the Wire and Dexter. So, Sopranos are definitely the godfather, Goodfellas and TV fiction
