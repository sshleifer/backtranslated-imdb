For anyone who wants to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russia's history this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins in the turn of the century (1900) in the yellow yellow sepia colors of old black and white colors during the mid-century and full color when the modern-day modern-day approach (ie the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a Siberian city village, who marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. He later entered the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communist to his village. His son, not the local beauty, fought the Germans during the Second World War. When it returns to the village, the oil industry takes and treats into the economic ideal of the Soviet Socialist Republic. This film is long and slow, but absolutely logical and very well done. It can be seen in three parts.
