it is the excellence narsisist and manipulator; In this case, posted lawyer (and murderer) Tom Capano. Kathryn Morris is sympathetic as victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but from the beginning is a bit too much victim. We are sorry for the situation, but it is even louder after seeing his victimization in several other women (including Rachel Ward). The sad part is where she is actually getting help with her own self problems, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed. Pretty hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. <br /> There is a comedy with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capano's mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true killings, and you'll want to read Ann Rule's book to get the exact details. 8/10.
