From the opening stage that aboard a crowded train where a pickpocket without mercy is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) steals from a woman's handbag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP on SOUTH STREET is relentlessly fascinating. In part it is because the act is exactly strong in the entire cast, B & W photography is dry and add to stress in the story and character, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same league with the biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, she has the same emergency as the Huston movie about an heist who goes wrong - but the regulation is not quite as strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard-side girl who Widmark described as being "hit in a lot". She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role in the woman is not too bright to wear a microfilms in her purse for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows about. They are on their trail when the flight arrives. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman named "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up for her and her life. She is particularly touched by her final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This is one guarantee to keep your attention in its hour and twenty minutes running time. Good from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
