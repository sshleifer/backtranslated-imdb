What a surprising treat to come across TV late. Did I only read a brief scheme on a TV list before seeing the movie, I'd pass. The idea of ​​a movie about a striking-man-seen-a shrunk-wish-to-be-business-and-fall-in-love .... sounds trite. But the movie works. From the start of the film, it's clear the man carrying a weight on his shoulder before he even says a word. The look and feel of the movie is perfect. dark, but not reckless. Aside from the striking family-stroke personality that gives a touch of surrealism, Macy's bold character and his marriage, and his father's control. Macy shows a regrettable sadness, and his talks with his son are amazing. The young boy shows his long-standing career skills, and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural, personal and loving. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I can not believe I came across it by crashing on late night TV.
