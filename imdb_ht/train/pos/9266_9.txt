Ah, the best and funniest film on female football fans, only a little better than 1982 legends of delusional teens set in North London (qv). By the way, I just watch this on movie 4 [2008-12-21] and I break my inability to set the PVR). <br /> This is my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with the twist added in looking like a guerrilla piece to make films in a team that apparently keeps filming which are forbidden in the country in which they are made (just think about the bit where girls are taken to the same stadium as the Sun is setting: quick all-round reaction). <br /> It is rare for a movie to make me laugh loudly, but when the rural soldier accompanies one of the girls in their voice while forcing her to put an unmasked mask made from a poster of Ali Daei, I could not stop waking others at home and my snorts, especially when the young soldier understood the grandfather's call for assistance ... <br /> Talking about the toilets, I just wish I had Can speak Farsi so I could work out the writing on the bathroom walls (yes, there were a few scribblings in Roman script, but mostly referred to wanky American rock bands). <br /> Also, in rural-with-Farsi terms, do you not rule that Omid Djalili sounds like a yokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the Guardian's Guardian in this movie and then go "Yup." <br /> I will not do about the sexual politics of Iran, and I will not do about the dubious act; I like this movie from the script and the correction: top top. <br /> Here's a list of my favorite movie movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Glory Glory 4. A Shot of Glory 5. Mystery the storage stadium
