This is a long lost wand horror starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to find a copy of this movie but it's worth it. This movie is crawling again cheese at the same time. It seems that 3 young youth news (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up arrives involving hotel rooms and seek refuge in the home of Earnest Keller ( Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, she feels sick, as the other two is going to the movie movie. It is soon murdered at home, in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (it is decapitated by the closed lid of the ventilation as it comes crashing down on it while it is equipped with the the basement). Soon Karen returns and is murdered in an even more brutal fashion does not have his face rammed in the ventilator cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (formerly?) Lover in a rather boring draw plot and when she returns home, has all her power (who by now we've discovered they are siblings and that's what it is that is in the basement is their child) a plot to try to kill it as well. Virgina does not fully agree with Earnest's plans to kill Jennifer, but she is fooled by going to the basement where she meets Junior. Here the movie turns almost funny as Junior (describes hysteria by Stephen Furst) is a distorted, mentally deficient, manchild of action and motion will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the movie picks up and finishes well done. The actors / actresses perform a terrific job with the material especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach and although it's not the most lurid movie ever made it very fun!
