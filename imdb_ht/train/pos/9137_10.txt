This is the only movie I've seen Prince but it does not matter. And I thought it was only great at boy singing I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. That's why he won the Oscar in 1984 for better music in a movie (or something like that). Now she has an Oscar and Grammies under her belt. Although the curse gets in the way with the movie (just make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie your collection is not complete unless you got this movie in it. What else I can say is that except for going and get this movie right now!
