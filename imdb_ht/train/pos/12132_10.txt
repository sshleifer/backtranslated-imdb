Agreeable in spite of Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a dish, refreshing character. One supposed to feel sorry for this man; However, I found myself screaming Davis' mildred noise. Ms. Davis gave her one of her finest performances (she received an award nomination Academy). Thanks to his performance he brings this film rather dull in life. ** Make sure you do not miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how he feels about it.
