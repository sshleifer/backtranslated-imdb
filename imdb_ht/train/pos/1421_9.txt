This documentary makes you travel around the globe. It has many rare and stunning things in the desert. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. The polar bears are marked at the beginning and end of it. After all, its weak future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. This documentary is however a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental problem. It can be easily seen by little children since it's mostly descriptive. Scientists might well be ashamed as it is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "A Convenient Truth" but honestly ... what a description !!! A question can then rise: Is not it worth preserving the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different difficulties. By living in the towns and cities we tend to forget that we are party and parcel of this nature. All of this is considered as a documentary reminding us that we possess a common treasure called "EARTH".
