I actually found this movie 'interesting'; Finally one is worth my time to look and rent. It's true ... some scenes were on the top of emotionalism, shouting, etc., but what movie does not stress its agenda, genre or 'ax grinder'? Almost no! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere by a S Review review on another site review but found its negative review rather a more accurate description of its "own" review of the movie ; not in the movie all. Anyone watching this movie will realize that it is great for families and friends; no car chases, yes !! Being "in" an Italian family myself, I can fully relate to the environment described on the screen. The film has its water jerking as well. It is what real life can be in these settings. Nice movie.
