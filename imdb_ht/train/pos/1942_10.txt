I consider myself a big movie movie. I was ill on the couch and popped in this movie. Right from the opening to the end I looked into awe of those great actors, I would never see, say big words. The movie was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I wish that this message was heard about any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats his actors at all. Thank you for making a movie like this one. Just nice left, beautiful character is flawless and graceful all at once. Just great. I can not submit this without the 10 full lines for my simply going to say that I hope for more from this director, plus all of the actors in this movie and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. End of
