"This person's marine" is, as indicated by other comments, a rare and well-kept look of the sailor lesser than LTA. LTA teams were just proud that the shady convoys never lost a boat in submarine attacks. And the filming of the various NAS locations gives a valuable overview of a kind of aviation that is time to go. However, the first half of the film is all about Beery, his relationship with his services, and his character meeting Tom Drake and his mother, and getting Drake's footsteps fixed. Only then begins the second movie. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a sub-surface, guys getting killed and lots of damage caused. The look is fairly frustrating and realistic, I imagine. Then we change in Southeast Asia. Does the marine have the LTAs? Never mind, this party is really wild, and a blimp used to extract some planes falling into the jungle. And the japs ​​are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a feel-good WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
