This is the kind of movie that, if he did today, it would probably be star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; Actually, now that I think about it, this one is quite responsible to be remade one day. It's nice, but with no depth whatever. She suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in her role as being over 20 years old too, and as a result there is no chemistry between her and Kim Novak's beautiful. Ernie Kovacs, in the role of supporting an aspirant writer, is the only actor in the movie whose performance approach is what you might call "understand". (** 1/2)
