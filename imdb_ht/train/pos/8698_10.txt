Had seen this movie on its release and was scratching it up. What a wonderful group of actors (I still get one of the most interesting casting aspects of a movie). Really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is still a hood. The script is smart, sly and tongue-in-cheek, pleasing the pleasure of almost everything "Beverley Hills". Loved the "doctor" Paul Bartel and Ray Sharkey's manager. This was raunchy and bit, but thanksgiving! Unless you're a pride, I recommend this movie. FYI for anyone who loves six degrees in Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov & Paul Bartel was in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in the "night of comet" together. They were all three of "Food Raoul".
