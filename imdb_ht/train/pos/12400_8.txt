This is the second animatrix, and the first of them to be what one can call 'artistic'. It has a lot of references, metaphorics and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a time running in 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human", or try to direct hate towards man, for "their sins against machine". I do not think it's true; It simply uses the robots to show us, that as people, we are not particularly accepted or open-minded towards anyone who is different from ourselves. I'd say he's done a good job. The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document, referring to what has led to one of the main conflicts of the trilogy. So it holds clips from fictional news and love reports. The voice acts very well, if there is not much of it. The animation is beautiful, with the use of colors, in spite of the drawing style usually realistically, making it more open to making the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery. This has several bits of strong and visual disturbances, as well as a little nudity. The disc keeps a comment, not in English but subtitled, and worth a listener. There is also a well done and informative make of, based on both parties, so I would advise watching it after seeing the next one, as well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the universe, and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
