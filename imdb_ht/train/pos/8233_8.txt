Fido is a story about more well-trained zombies trained to serve the human race. All fall apart, when Timmy's young Fido zombies feed the neighboring family. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, mess) occurs. Most people treat zombies with justice, and a character like sleeping with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not too much disturbing too). And we found the Fido likewise what he can do. This is a very funny and unique movie, especially for the genre of zombie. It is also probably one of the least violent zombie cinemas (there is no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to those who are looking for something funny and different. I miss this 8/10. Rated R for related violence zombies
