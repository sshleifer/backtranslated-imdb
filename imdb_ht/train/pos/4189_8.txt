Richard Widmark is a character attached to this movie. It is a professional pickpocket. He was imprisoned three times, but at the beginning of the movie, he was trying to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flames by Widmark. This is a piece of period during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare led politics and it was worked to draw this nicely. What's strange about this movie is that Peters & Ritter is both violent violent victims in an era where women have rarely been more than sex objects in film. This is what made this noir movie as women often got different roles in this type of movie. The movie is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as below for dual features of the theater. The composition shows that it is a limited budget film. The script made J Edgar Hoover crazy because patriots were given short letters. Hoover wanted it to change. <br /> Rather, it became a B under the picture card that was a Sleeper hit in 1953. The script and acting in it are better than other great features were this year.
