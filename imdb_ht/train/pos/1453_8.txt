Well, there are a lot of ways how to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derived or too ambitious, often present a plot that is totally paranoid and incredible. But City Hall does not make the above mentioned. The plot is cleverly fabricated, history is credible. As far as character goes I would say this movie is a solid average. No character looks out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrait of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.
