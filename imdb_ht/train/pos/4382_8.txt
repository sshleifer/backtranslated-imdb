Illuminated by "Braveheart" released the same year, two costume dramas are compared to comparisons. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, but I hold a rational preferences for "Rob Roy." Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" compellingly describe Scots history of blood, romantic fashion. "Braveheart" is a seasonal season on individual honor and courage and a fantasy revenge fantasy. It's also melodramatic, anachronic and maudlin. Note its use of cornballs in slow motion gowns. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the quality letter that makes it more appealing to the adolescent attitude. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" at the absolute level of carnage (not to mention the time it's running out), the latter film is finally more mature and satisfying. Its actions are more understated, yet more surprising and smart. Her sex is less blatant, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better way to realize romantic interest. Its dialogue attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. Its luggage in the mouths of the actors attempts to approximate the dentist in the era. And Tim Roth is a cruel superlative. Also recommended: "The Last Mohikan" and the "Patriot." You can find the letter more akin to "Braveheart" with its emphasis on bloody desires, and the former more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the aforementioned movies merit the R assessment for violence.
