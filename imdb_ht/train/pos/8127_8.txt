While a little preachy on the subject of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still a stunning movie that presents science-fiction the special effects of the blokbusters that would take another 40 years to reach the silver screen. It predicts the global disruption of WWII, but raising the citizen does not have the controversy last 30 years, and then tells the epic history of people struggling from the debris and wildlife of space. The act looks like wild and unusual sterile, but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals that must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of release the movie and still impress today. This film is not to be missed by anyone of all interested in the genre of SF.
