It's a story that might have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. Street entertainers take the attention of famous opera stars and friendships. The aging landing finds / buys a child's son than his art. From there, we follow them in the rigors of hard life, but free on the river. Traveling city to town, it does with some degree of notoriety. Despite the times and influences, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, performance is the first percentage, especially Xu Zhu, who shows street scene. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and downright strong, and holds the brawl prejudice. The two protagonists, along with support of the singer opera singer, Liang (a Zhong Zhong interesting in Android), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned similar films similar to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MOTHER CONCUBINE); but this movie can not stand easily on its own, any resemblance is the best remote. <br /> <br /> Only my calmness and the king of masks, is the finish. It was weak, cliche and as subtle as a sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation? What a shame. To bring a fine motion picture that far, only surrender to emotional (and sharpening) pathos like that. He honestly made this movie good, instead of the classic, it should have been. Aside, the King of Mass is always very well worth your time. I was pleased to see the Shaw brothers are still producing good films. Very recommended.
