Riveting drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacking his car by violating Joe (James Russo). He managed to get away from the cops to inform him that nothing can do. He realized, however, Joe found his wallet and knew where he lived. When Housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off to work, Joe paid him a visit to finish what he started. After Joe outraged and degraded it in a variety of ways, he gets a chance to strike back to him and his imprisonment. Knowing all his assets in another "word against you" situation and that no rape technically took place, he has no intention of facilitating it until he confessed to Pat and Terry what his intentions were. The movie finally grabs a confrontation between its two opponents. As it goes on, Marjorie shows as unforgiving that someone needs to wonder if he has not become as unhinged as his nemesis. Fawcett does a sufficiently credible job, while Russo is really excellent as the digging crap makes his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on screen for many of the time running, the movie has an intimate nature that suggests that it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the uglier and more exploiting elements of the situation; The movie gets uncomfortable to look at times. But not Marjorie's time has the upper hand, things change enough so it does not become so easy to encourage her to go to blood, and one hopes that Pat could make her see right. <br /> <br /> "Extreme," I felt, was a very good movie that at least maintained interest with a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both fine in support (Scarwid has a great moment where Terry reveals himself to be a victim of rape), and the pace is consistent. Granted, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is compelling every step of the way. <br /> 8/10
