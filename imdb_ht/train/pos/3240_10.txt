I found this movie not mistaken many years ago and asked then (always do) why he did not get the reputation he should have. Well written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and there is plausibility in what the nefari characters are trying. I would not recommend this movie to those who have sharpened attention; It requires intelligence to understand that there may be a kernel of truth in this story.
