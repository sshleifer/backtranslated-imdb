Wow baby, this is indeed some good Asian horror / gore, and a crazy movie out there. This is a Japanese splatterfest who reminds me a little in Tetsuo, except in this case with the blood and bowel, has a rare love story. It's hard to imagine how to even dream up this stunning visual movie, with some unique unique creatures that infected people as parasites, turning them into party cars or guessing cyborgs. The only thing wrong with these creatures after taking someone, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb band to add to all the fun. The film also borrowed a little from the Carpenter's "stuff" in animal design and effect. I would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is no carnage and some gore very well. With a must-have for stoners, because you do not even need to read sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough to travel yourself. The design of the little animals that live the human body as a fetus reminds me a little of Frank Henenlotter's movie, which is another tribute to some excellent Gore films and a sense of humor. "Bullet car" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and I simply loved it.
