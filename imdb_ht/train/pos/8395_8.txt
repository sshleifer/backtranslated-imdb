*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is without a doubt the best movie of Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the wonderful movie script to increase by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. Films start out with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the decrease of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister have to scratch by surviving . Maria decided to find a job as a dancer / whore at a club that welcomed the American GI and met a black army soldier called Bill (Greg Eagles) and began to see each other on a fixed basis. Maria heard that her husband Hermann died in the war to get seriously and Bill. But one day while getting intimate and Bill to see Hermann in the door. She did not die and when she entered the room a scuffle was done with Maria breaking a bottle on top of the bill and she died. Hermann takes the blame and sentenced to a long term in prison for Maria telling him that he will succeed in something and get him out. The war ended with Germany to be rebuilt and a day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and uses his charm to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and raise the corporate ladder and become the mistress of Karl. He tells her that she will never marry her but she's in love with her. Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get on everything that Maria has done since she was locked. <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys his own home. Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to begin their wedding even though they have been married for some time now. But Maria left the gas on the stove and the house exploded with both of them still in it. <br /> There are many interesting things in this movie that its one of these movies that can be studied and talk about in great lengths. Like in all Fassbinder films is the use of colors used in a very interesting way. As the movie begins to tone the brown and gray are represented by torn Germany, but as Maria begins to become successful in changing bright colors such as red and white. Reconstruction in Germany and all the sounds of construction were used as a series only with the film remaining focused on the exploits of Maria. Fassbinder wanted sound reconstruction to remind us of what's happening in Germany at this time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to success of this film. With a younger actress this might be just another exciting movie but Schygulla is so strong that his performance elevates this movie into an elite statue. Schygulla shows Maria as much determined and clever, but at the same time she uses her beauty and feminine to be what she wants. He is not embarrassed nor guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who practically sold her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award but has given a great performance that will stand the test in time. Fassbinder himself appears in the movie as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Mrs. Ehmke. I've heard a lot about the movie ends and she did and Maria deliberately left the gas on. Later in the toilet he is running water on his arm and appears to be sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong please email me. I think it was too excited by Hermann being home and leaving it on crash (Remember to put on a dress for no reason?). Then, when reading it, read it at that point that he learns that Hermann and Karl have become friendly without their knowledge and I think he felt that everything he did was for nothing. The reason for the bathroom scene. So, when the house explodes it does not crash. But I think the reason for Fassbinder has a finish like this to show that anyone who would sell the soul does not have any living business. Fassbinder was captivated by surviving but he was also extremely passionate. In her view Maria can not have her both ways. A fascinating movie.
