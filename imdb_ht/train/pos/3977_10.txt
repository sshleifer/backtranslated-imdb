I personally watch this to see the foot of the 60's and 70's. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement was essentially started and became a pop culture with an eventually compromising force in life. The interviews of the classical rock stars are titular and funny. You feel like you are in a secret and sign yourself at the same time ... because it feels so good and habitual. I liked it, all segments from 60's-present days. I highly recommend this for every aspect, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good stories' ol. I'm checking the box that says this has a spoiler, only because I have no idea what some may consider a beck or not in this regard, since I've discussed what's in all 4 segments, so just have want to be safe.
