It was almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick. I watched this movie almost 10 times and it was a great effort by Gautham. From my perspective, I feel this film is usually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt .. classy.Jyothika has played her role as Maya very well.The character of costume is very well.The character who kept film-spectator attention was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well .Brutal and Fireworks .Jeevan deserved to receive the best award award at ITFA 's 2004.Get in support of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Racy scenario, perfect-timed dialogue and brilliant narratives by Gautham.The band by Harris Jeyaraj are all board-busters while the BGM suits the film very well. Movieography by RD Rajasekhar is rich.Peter Hein choreographed the exhibits well.Anthony correction is exact.In addition, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop movie filled with right doses of action and romance. Even some Hollywood films can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... without doubt.
