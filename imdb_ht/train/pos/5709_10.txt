Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We are open on a quiet little French village, scanning the roofs of the sleepy citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. When investigating the chaos, two neighbors told stories of two men, supposedly friends, who took two numbers for the lottery. Our star in the picture has its number and his friends. When he asked his friends, he would share half of the dough, his ticket would be the winning number, his friend promptly said no. In fact, H.E. double hockey stick no! This way he acts on it. So when people discover that they have the ticket won and that it has lost, in no fault of its own, it is frantic. Everyone comes out for themselves, looking for this ticket, to something like a precursor to the "Great Race." Even though this is all a flashback, I was in the nod all the time and was so upset about all the little things in this all-for-me show-i-money in the cash-in-bank movie . Watch Le Million Today!
