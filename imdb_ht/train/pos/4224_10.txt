I love this episode of Columbo. Perhaps it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and is wonderful as the success of mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. It is delicious to watch as perky, the lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when his niece died in a withered accident. He blames his niece, nephew. He plans to kill him to avenge his death since the abandoned police. I would like someone else to pass Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never really love Hartley in anything personally. And of course with Columbo, there are some laughs when it comes to Veronica's question in a vantage-dance class. Abigail Ruth is a clever sleuth himself and he charms and Columbo always plays beautifully by Peter Falk.
