This movie started me on a kick to Nick Cage. It's a full story of twists and turns - a movie of motifs and moves. In, course, Dennis Hopper was a hammer, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who fell into the Internet. Everything about this film is good - cinematography, storytelling and most of all the end. Cage excels in what it does best - it must not be a hero action but to be a whole person caught in the trap of life.
