This is cult stuff. My friends and I get together once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen dozens of these times and have not yet enjoyed it. Funny comics and it gets better with every look! If you enjoyed "Morons from Space" you will love this. A great play about the world wars. I like the red sack to find the aliens, the bug on the hood, the DOD, the heat looking for the annulus, the mine, the Camo Red, breaking speed limits by 1800Mph! "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I would like this out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews to see it for yourself!
