A piece of trivia that often is forgotten about this family movie is one of business. At that time, in 1994, this film held the record for premiere of the biggest movie in motion picture history (and can continue to hold). Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film of "Angels" that "haunted" the Pittsburgh pirates. In this note they are "haunted" California Angels. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the premiere was held in time to visit three Rivers Stadium which was home to the Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Pittsburgh pirates at the time (the pirates are now housed at PNC Park and the Steelers of Heinz Field). The premiere was held on a movie screen of five stories in height inside the stadium and held (and may even continue to hold) the record for the biggest film premiere in history, showing 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all present in admiration of thousands of sports fans.
