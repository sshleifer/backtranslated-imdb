This movie is absolutely stunning. A new blade runner - the future of the most fearless. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognizable and visionary, with sweeping perspectives, grungy series and virtual futuristic reality. The story line is quite simple, with some surprises, but that's not what I like most about the movie. It is a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Make in 3D and render in black and white (no gray!) and only one short spot in color, it is less difficult on the eyes than it sounds. There are many "art" camera shots - closeups and odd views - but that just adds to temperament in the movie. In general you get the impression of a graphic novel in shape. I was initially under the impression that the film was rotoscoped, as was the level of animation and high detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike "A Darkly Scanner" - who suffers from (or indeed is increased by) definition of consistent character (just look at the way some of the changing hair shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and precise at all. When the character is in close-up, added details and texture can be seen bee, but when in mid-shot or more away from the omissions details, but not the detriment of character definition. <br /> For me, the only side of the movie is that in one Comment we say that this is a one-off project. So, a shame, as I would like to see more of this futuristic-futuristic-futuristic cinema and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> Oh, and the English dub is great too. <br /> All in all a great movie and highly recommended.
