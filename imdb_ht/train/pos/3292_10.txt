Paperhouse is the most moving and impressive movie I've ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie" that I believe is a serious mistake. Some journeys once call it the "nightmare of thinking about Elm Street" and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I can not help but think it is a tag that is worthy of error and error. Those who can only see the horrors really miss out here and only serve to demonstrate they really do not think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just try to classify this wonderful job is probably a bad idea. Quite simply, Paperhouse is perfect in all exquisite details and will always be a special place in my heart. As someone who is wiser than me once said, "The movie hit you on a completely emotional level", which can go one way to explain why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing. To be honest, I do not apologize for this, if you feel my words are too sacrificing for your taste, stop reading now because there is more to come. <br /> It's so rare to find a movie that is in his heart pain and grief of childhood and struggle to overcome the feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely cover us at this vulnerable time in our lives. Even more strangely to find actors who can actually play their role with the sensitivity and intelligence required to do it all work. At Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspiring piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse be very much in their ability to show the sadness and loneliness of childhood (often neglected) in a seamless and compelling way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) <br /> <br /> Adding all the things to an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative and most beautiful cinematic and haunting band you will ever be most likely to hear and you can begin to get a tip on why I There are so many affections and abilities that this movie has no number of words to express. <br /> <br />
