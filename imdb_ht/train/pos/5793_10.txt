Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story of the movie begins, we get a performance in the Bad Tour (Man in the mirror), and it kicks off a big movie. After finding a kind of a collage of Michael Insurance companies, as it was until Moonwalker came from 1988. After a few videos too (Speed ​​Demon, let me alone, etc.) the story begins. /> The plot is basically that Michael and his 3 friends (which the kids) were being chased by the bad guy in the story "Big Guy", because they discovered his evil plans getting the kids all over the world spent on drugs. During the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth criminals, which is absolutely fantastic and its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the kids gets kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will return to save it before becoming a drug addict. /> During the film we see special effects not only amazing for these standard days but also impressive today. For example, watch Michael turn into a robot / spatial in order to protect his friends! It's so cool! The film ends with a performance of Come Together (later published in Michaels double-album in HIStory), and you left the movie with a magical sentiment. Amazing! <br /> I recommend this to every family wishing to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is a supposedly abused child!" Yeah, it's true, but, come on, we all know it is not true! Wait and see ..
