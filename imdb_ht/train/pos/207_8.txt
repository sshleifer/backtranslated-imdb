At first this looked like a boring comedy as the odd couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny movie. Basically, former comedian Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winning, with Golden Burns nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive the plot of hospitals for a TV show. Neve Willy, Ben Clark (Golden Globe win Richard Benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how bad it is. They can not be found on all the time, they both forget, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. Also begins Lee Meredith as Miss McIntosh's Nurse, Carol DeLuise as Ms. Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's Nursing and Muppets from F. Murray Abraham Space as Mechanic. I think the best line in the movie is Burns to mention that Matthau calls it "a son a bitchard bitch". She has nominated Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted to Other Materials, she has nominated BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and was the Golden Globe Best Movement Picture - Music / Comedy, and He was nominated for Best Screenplay. Really good!
