First an explanation of what makes a movie great for me. Excitement about not knowing what's next is going to make me enjoy a movie first time I watch it (maybe highlighting: Twister). There are also other things that go on a great first look like Good Humor (John Candy at Buck Uncle and the Great Outdoors), Good Idea and Madeline and Matilda, Storytelling Imaginary (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas is MAN) , and good music (yet all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What made me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and bought a DVD or VHS tape? Character. With that said, I introduced Cindy Lou Ki and Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans. But every single scene with Cindy and Grinch-set is excellent and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the drawing. The grinch has a strong draw, good controversy, and a very good theme (I can not get started because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny as Grinch - particularly when he interacts with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I liked her selection of instruments and compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey-I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is just enough to see the movie at least once. On Your Solo - Where Are You Christmas - Is Your Voice Really Like A High Heels? Sounds like an F #? This is an obscene set for a 7 year old (obscene means in the best possible way). Good job. This is the best performance by a child I've ever heard of in a movie (Taylor beats from Trapp-Child-No Little feat!). And now the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this really showed off of his scene with Taylor Momsen). The unspoken Taylor Momsen expressions (one of the secrets of a good performance action) are very strong-it really gets Cindy Lou Who. But when it does dialogue is even stronger. <br /> <br /> *********************** Danger: spoiler alerts *************** ****** ************************* ***************** *************** <br /> <br /> Example: expression when she sees the first grinch. This is a classic quote ("You are here" and then filling in with the Grinch line "da da da the grinch-after which it panels in the sorter and then is rescued by the grinch) . " Thank you for saving me "quote and subsequent response by the Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. are two excellent actors in best communicating and expressing each other with Little Taylor Momsen completely holding his own self with Jim Carrey in that place. I sincerely hope that we see Taylor Momsen in many more films coming .. All in all was great on this movie (except perhaps the feet and the nose).
