The first time I saw this movie in U.K. in December 1989 when the Central Television broadcast it. I still have the video tapes, although torn out (over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and were also crumpled by it!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home this night, grabbing a tipple Christmas, changing the lights out and watching what was being published as a 'Christmas Ghost History'. Even now, I remember the certain scenes that always throw their hair over my neck standing on the end ... <br /> I've seen some comments on the film saying it's not this and not that ... I think people These find pairs by Friday 13th and the love, stalks and rammel cuts, which are ridiculous. This is a 'traditional story' ghost; There is no big budget action or special effects ... there is no oath, without blood, no free sex scene, no chainsaws or weapons etc ... So how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you love horror cottages, well written, well-acting and a really frightening atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; Only last night I saw the original haunt and that's a superb movie. Very atmospheric yet - and so is the woman in Black. Movie films are different in the book, but are still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you * will * love it if you love traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn fire, shut the doors, grab a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
