Part of the fun that I took in this movie came from the fact that I do not know anything more about it than playing John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to look), was a piece of period and chess involved . All that has evolved before I was completely unexpected. So I do not have to give more. Enough to say that Turturro is magnificent as a unique genius, obsessive and deeply vulnerable and Em matches his steps for stage as the woman-minded woman who draws on it. It's about love and obsession, rather than the venerable board game and after my drawing gradually on the first half of aid, has become totally compelling. And I challenged anyone second-guess the finish.
