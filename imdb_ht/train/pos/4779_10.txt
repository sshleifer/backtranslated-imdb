On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling around the coast on a rising mower certainly does not have much to call him, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Right Story." The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a young runaway girl. She is pregnant and afraid that parents would get out if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about her own child, long ago. It has to each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he had to pack the sticks and try to break them. "This package," he said, "is family." So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and to ensure that we knew that someone might break, but the members were stronger. The "right story" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply let you contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's trip through Iowa is all of these enfreshingly un-Hollywood interactions. Every interaction is filled with heat and humor, and Alvin is so cute to ride his mower that we can not help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final stage emphasizes the real story here is not the destination, but the trip. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - of the benefits to us. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride to remind us of all we have lost and the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> The "right story" is rare live-action "G" movie-film that really should not miss. Grade: A
