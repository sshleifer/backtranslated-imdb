This movie had no party that was hilarious, especially just average comic unit, but it did not have any part that was really bad either. The worst part was the South's voice. Slur slut it was just too much for me. By about 5 minutes I was sick of hearing him speak. Aside from the annoying voices the movie was good. There were many side jokes that if you catch to make the movie the best. This is a good movie for kids. She had enough of her to maintain adult content and enough to entertain the kids. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
