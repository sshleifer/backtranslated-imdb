A good romantic comedy in which I do not think I've ever seen Meg looking any cuter. All players have done a great job in keeping this a living queen. Of course, in the real world no engineering mathematician would even look at some fat monkeys, but that is why I love romantic comedy .... one can just totally forget reality and have a good time. Nice movie. Damn, Meg is a babe, eh?
