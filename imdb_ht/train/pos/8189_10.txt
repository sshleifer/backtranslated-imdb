This was an excellent 2nd-party episode, although I never saw the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go against anything that paranormal, extra terrestrial of course, but not paranormal. The episode brings the things that we are most frightened and how we would people, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat evil evil wrong when most likely say that would be impossible. <br /> <br /> When it's a movie my family I'm surprised to have brought some things into such fear and confidence, especially if it's also going to entertain American audiences. But who cares about what is hard to say, we rock! Doctors Who have shown potential ever since one episode of the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to fear, from grave fun, from light to darkness. I hope that many old fans will soon say "The old doctor has returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
