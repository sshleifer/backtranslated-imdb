This is what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing about TV. The League includes Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, marks the gatiss and the beautiful Sheem Reece. Totally melee, this horror-comedy is perfection. Characters are iconic and catchphrases are rare, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone simply must look. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the league in Mr. is that it is always cool, and always push the boundaries. He does not need to rely on catchphrases (unlike Britain) for it to be funny. The fact that the league they want to kill in arguably their most popular and iconic characters, shows us that they have balls in steel.
