Snobs and pseudo experts consider it "a far cry from the De Sica's best" People who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connected with this ruler. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italianness does not have the test to convince the self of modern Italian filmmakers, or parody of their own bitter purity of Pietro Germi, the bitter bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories like a father sitting at his children's edge corner before they went to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent The Universal Giudizio is against realistic fact, or what today we call magic realism. The film is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart, but that, of course, requires that you have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.
