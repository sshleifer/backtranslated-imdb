An atmospheric cheapie, which shows great intelligence in the use of accessories, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an unusual texture with Moody. The story is farfetched, the act is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a whole visual narrative. This film is recommended for its attitudes and texture, not for its history.
