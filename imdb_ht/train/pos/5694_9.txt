Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific. I saw Kilmer on the doors, however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb. Nothing compared to Boogie's Nights was kind of slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a terrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who just indulged in his drug vice and indolent in what ever happens around. At the same time, character John Holmes shows a very clever hustler who can pass through the nastiest situations and ugliest almost injured. The movie deserves to look more than once. Siberian sensual and full of drugs is amazing.
