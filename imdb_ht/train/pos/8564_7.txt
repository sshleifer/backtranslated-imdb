I do not expect this movie to be well understood by viewers from Romania. This tells a certain thing about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the movie, but also says something about how different stories and even life of common people were in Romania compared to other countries, even in Europe the east. The movie is an adaptation of a novel by Marine Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule right after publishing the book. He tells the story of a scholar, professor of philosophy whose life is breaking after he was in jail on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in the second prison, describing his attempts to regain his life after being released. His release is actually only apparent, Romania in the 60s demanding from him different types of compromises and crimes, but yet his fight for survival is as difficult as morally imprisonable. The movie is suppressed by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the lead role should be in another time and elsewhere a mega-star, we can find here a good preview of his fabulous acting art. Although suffering from a hard-earned story and sometimes falling in detail is not essential or comic character, the film is still a valuable landmark for the Romanian movie theater, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historical values ​​of the Romanian society.
