This is really one of the best movies on love that I've ever seen. A little followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which technically is not another movie at all, since it's about the same people and even the romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, only if most people are as intelligent and easy to talk like their drive in the movie. Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how many others are crazy about movies based on dialogue as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It is hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fell in love, 'cause you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the bar, where they pretend to their best friend phones, and others pretend to be the best friend. It's PERFECT. Make you back in the very moment when you fall in love for the first time in your life. <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, see "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset". If like me, you look at "Sunset" first, it's hard to shake the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the whole show. <br /> Again, the greatest romantic movie in my book. Beautiful acting, excellent script, and beautiful places. Young love, in its best.
