Robert Urich was a fine actor, and made this film TV credible. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when viewed it a second opinion I remained the same. Those who lost who was when they entered this exclusive club, in a rich California city computer. Urich tries to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I like the idea of ​​Halloween costume space, glossy. This movie is about the fight in one's sprite. TV quality, beyond, the big budget, gangs in New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the man his compassion presented in many of his films? I hope that! 6 or 7 out of 10.
