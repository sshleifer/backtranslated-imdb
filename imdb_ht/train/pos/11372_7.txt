"Citizen X" tells the story of the "Butcher of Rostov", nickname for an enormous and perverse serial killer assassin who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who doggedly pursues the assassin against any luck in the face of an uncooperative bureaucrats in self-employed practice practices. An HBO product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performance, spending the audience much of the details grisly, but playing out as a docudrama sense of stylistics like Hollywood fare. An even and straight-forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little story known more than the "Jack Riper". (B)
