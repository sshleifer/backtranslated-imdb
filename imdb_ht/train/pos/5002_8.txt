I was privileged to see some cuts from the original Aardman's run at this show in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. None of the charm lost in translation - it's as cool as people are interviewed - if some of it is scripted or not, as they rumored, is around the point. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations show great imagination of the characters used for each voice, the single aspect that I probably love most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, paint the one). Regular they really grow on you as well, like the horse and the kid from Maryland, most every married couple (parrots, insects, and cats are in the name of a few) and child-voice characters, and I really come to dig the ferret! Monday is finally becoming a day in which to look forward.
