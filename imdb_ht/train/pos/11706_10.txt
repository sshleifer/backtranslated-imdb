For all the reviews on this page, I should say this movie is worth seeing. So it was born in 1972, so so. Fashion in the movie was exactly the same in its time. People who did not study culture in decades would think that this film is a cheese ball. Compared with the modern series, `Left Behind, '(which is made for our time now) it looks cheesy. However, the only Cheezy part of the film is the fashion, which has been again over 30 years in the past. Men. The message sent to this film is very powerful, carefully preserved. There are just so much to say, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of it) So go out and see this movie! If you do not like the message that it sends, then you have problems, which needs some attention!
