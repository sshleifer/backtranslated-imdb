The film took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how it was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big big is that I thought Gandhi was amazingly uncharismatic in the movie. He could best act by those who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi 's statements seemed too filmy and looked like he was intentionally described in a negative light in some parts of the film. The movie is not really all-rounded, but focuses only on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show time frames and the overall environment of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
