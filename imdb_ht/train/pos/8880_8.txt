In the life of (some) colleges. Of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of the things you saw in this movie went to some colleges. <br /> I went to college in southern California where the races pretty much hang around with their own. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. and I can honestly say, that's it. But the thing is when classes leave out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for classes, they (students) seem just hang around with people in their own race or ethnicity. Is this bad? Not really. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But like school papers at one of my schools I went to write once, "we should all try to hang around other ethnic students and try to know them." Otherwise you will create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of the schools I attended. Once a person had placed leaflets around the campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of the racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the White Youth was going and started shooting at a multicultural rally. <br /> I can only hope and pray that there is nothing like that ever happened. > <br /> So, is "dramatic learning" overly dramatic? Egzajere? Maybe. Is it the way "off brand?" It depends on where you went or went to school. The race thing where ethnicities are just hanging around and their own doing happen. The fewer Hollywood exercises, the race thing hit very close to me.
