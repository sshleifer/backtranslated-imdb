I just watched Holly along with another movie about sex and sexual exploitation of her film called The Movie Act of the International Film Festival. I must say that Holly blows trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. From purely an artistic and kinetic perspective, it is amazing. Sound mixing, camera angles, directing and acting all over. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way it handles the substance is tasteful and non-exploitable. It presents the problem of sexual exploitation of the child in a way that is both educational and accurate. Filmists have paid a number of exquisite attention to detail, genuinely capturing the nuances of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. Too often when faced with a topic of this kind, it is tempting the audience's shock and scene of graphic rape, and violence. Holly is able to achieve all these things without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly in two separate film festivals, once in the U.S. and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen more audiences moving. Just hearing conversations after screening, people are asking what they personally can do to fight for sexual exploitation of children. <br /> I recommend it to everyone, both to value its cinemas and its subjects.
