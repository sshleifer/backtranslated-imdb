As an aging rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - I 2 favorite groups ever - but with the incredible cast (everyone) - with the fantastic storyline - I just love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it very much - and Mick Jones has added a lot (Foreign lead and primary components along with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I watched this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - who That's a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent in each port - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what more could an aging rocker ask for !! 10/10 - without glossy. <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Originally from Windsor, England.
