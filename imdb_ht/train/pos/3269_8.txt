Chances are a good romantic fantasy about a woman (Christopher McDonald) woman (Cybill Shepherd) killing shortly after learning she is pregnant. We then see the husband in heaven leaving the powers that must know that he took too early and that his wife needed him. He said he could return to earth, but not like himself. Flashforward 19 years where we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and meet a young man (Robert Downey Jr) who turns out to be the reincarnation of her father. The movie is slightly on the predictable side ... The story goes all the way you expect it, but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but get wrapped up in the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen at best advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. A wonderful and good fantasy that will swallow and enchant you.
