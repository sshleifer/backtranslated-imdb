A serious comedy. Ross Hunter produces the French version of the movie "Les Joies de la famille" (later American as "A Very Rich Woman") is plush, well driven, occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, who seems to frittering away her money, is slippery by her growing up, green daughter, both of whom are afraid Mama Rosie is negligence than their inheritance. The whole problem of a vital - but aged - woman sent to a rest home will be, and later that has proved herself listening to a court hearing, material is handled for a comedy (and her credit, director David Lowell Rich Do not surcharge the picture with coolest gags or obvious feelings). Some of the humor are a little bigger and do not work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the inherent gravity of this scenario and never hits a fake note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's daughter, and James Farentino is very good as a young lawyer. The film has much to say about the importance of our seniors, and the ways in which they choose to spend the remaining time, the gravity of the theme "Rosie!" Almost gets lost in the rush to a happy end. The photo leaves you smiling - and at the same time wondering how many older women there are never quite so lucky. *** from ****
