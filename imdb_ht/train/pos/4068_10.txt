grandiose, this is undoubtedly the best animated evergreen cartoon. I saw the first mansion in the sky in the late 80s as a child and left a lasting impression. year has gone by and I forgot the title of the movie, and only by chance surfing over the internet I found this prince again. after reading other people reviews and analysis I'm not surprised to have such reputation and touching many because it leaves an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for every child and adult. Its best not to give the story away so I might say this movie watch will be a clear and open spirit. If you have children treated this I promise you will love it. There is not much to say about this piece of art, but if you have not seen it look and enjoy.
