"History of the Century" was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the '54 -'55 TV season. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy award. Starring west veteran actor Jim Davis as detective Matt Clark, the series of Clark series and his partner partner detective partner (Mari Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" during the second half) against historic western banned various periods from the mid 1860s to the early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch, and fairly realistic due to the especially charming Jim Davis charm of the lead role. It seemed like a real Western character. Another note. When Matt Clark came to town after a long ride it actually seemed to be on a long horse ride as it should cover in dust. A very good west adult early.
