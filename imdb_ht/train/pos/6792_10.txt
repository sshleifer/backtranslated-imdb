I remember this game. She always sat on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I stared at it, since it was the first ever game for the PS1 that I owned having 4 discs. When I was playing it, I could not put the controller down, seriously. The storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII story, and that's hard to accomplish. When you play the game, you get involved with the characters it's incredible that it's just a PS1 game, as it feels like a movie. And I believe it should be done in a movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad game this is a very weird game and barely no one has played or loved it, as it is one of those games that are located on the ends of the shelves, and A 50% sign of sitting on it, trying to sell. Well I'm one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, so I went into Final Fantasy VII, looking at a catalog, and found it. But this is different than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragons, the only game or RPG is best than most Enix Square Games, amazing. I would not be surprised if it was done by Square Enix but it's not. Hardly any game I play is better than the final fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bugs me is why it is very little known and does not praise, which it should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are very good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It's PS1 person, made in 1999. My story has already mentioned is amazing, almost beat VII. Characters are an amazing, very involved with them, and their actions. A definite 10 out of 10. Definitely deserves more praise, and a very good RPG made by a company other than Square Enix.
