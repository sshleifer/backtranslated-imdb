After 7 years of watching that nonsense called Star Trek Voyager I felt pretty numb. Next There and DS9 were without good things and Voyager ruined TV trolley. This is open and probably the best pilot in a trekking show. The team was really good as the choice of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula has played a typical first-time commander in deep space and unpolished ways to make things a refreshing change of all the captains they know before. The rest of the crew was really unmatched in their roles and I think they got in a good first season. When the show prematurely canceled I was really disappointed. In a Darkly Glass showed us what the cast could. The pity of a movie or movie movie has never been considered. So many back stories and foundations of the Federation let them say, including the onset of hostilities and the Klingons ..........
