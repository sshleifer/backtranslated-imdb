Paul Verhoeven (genius and movie master markers) hit back and less perfect than, but still enjoying an "old man's style man," Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappears. But I give a recommendation to this movie for its MIND flowing special effects (perhaps the best so far around) and two dandy performance by driving. Verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought provocative, and although the film turned off, this film is very soft-core for old Verhoeven. Two major defects: Josh Brolin (aka Mark-Man Market) and the entire deal with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they locked down in the laboratory? <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
