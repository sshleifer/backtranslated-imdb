Although critically criticized, Johnny Dangerous is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie that should look good; Some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention to draw them. For example, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of pricing weapons in pet stores ... and also over the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of the stage. It's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here - If you enjoyed his best known film (The Fast Times of High Ridgemont, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should give this one a look. Michael Keaton is very interesting in the title role and cast in support (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Very recommended.
