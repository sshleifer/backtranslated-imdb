A sequel to an era released here in the United States in the spring of 2002 and the "rookie," a Disney live action movie that seemed to be "best for the latest !!!!!" It took place right here in Texas! Actually, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by a zone code found on a sign on it. He was on a high school coach who was convinced by his high baseball team that he decided to go professionally !!!!! <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was sooo nice !!! !! It was a very good movie of the sport, as the "mighty ducks" trilogy. She also takes movies across Texas, from a place between the Panhandle and El Paso all the way to the Metroplex (where I live). I can say because I recognize that ballpark (was "Ballpark in Arlington;" now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "Golden Age" end here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Golden Age of Disney <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and it ended with baseball . " (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
