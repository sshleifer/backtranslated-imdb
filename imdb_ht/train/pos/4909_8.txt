Most movies about, or the New Orleans, turn out to be sadly bad, and sadly incorrect (eg: remember the "Savage Bees"? But I'll make an exception for "Tightrope", which almost got it right) . <br /> <br /> Here's one that does not inevitably get it wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "accent" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than south), the city in 1950 shows how he / she was, without the "tourists" boots, and they understood a good drama without trying to make everyone an "original southerner". <br /> One of the few movies to do justice in this city, with a good movie to boot.
