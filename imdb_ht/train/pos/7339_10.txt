Ever since I heard two versions Ralph Bakshi in the "Lord of the Rings" I was amazed: What hell is 'rotoscope animation'? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago no idea that Ralph Bakshi is ... And I love reading ... a lot ... It's very good story line ... it even has a little character development that is great for a cartoon ... See if you get bored with contemporary animation .... Do not get me wrong ... I do not say it's just a beautiful drawing ... It's a very good movie too ...
