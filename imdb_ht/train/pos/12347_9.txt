This is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, which could be best described and constellation of scenes and direction of Old Kurosawa's work, combined with Dostoyevski's subject of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova) , Shakespeare's dramas and Hans Christian Andersen are tragic and happy. The scenario is beautiful, the scenes are color- and beautiful few scene stays really printed in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the very well developed and interesting characters - there is also a little action, so if you do not like all the feelings you would also come to your expense -. It's not about Geishas mysterious and proud Samurai and Bushido are all pouring out of them, but on life, work and quality of people found everywhere at any time. A beautiful and fascinating gift to Kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.
