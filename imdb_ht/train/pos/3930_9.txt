It is remarkable that for players to support the player "Young Mr. Lincoln" Ford cast less known, other actors-than-stars. This not only increases his film focus on the central character of Lincoln, but it also gives the audience a worthwhile insight into Lincoln as a man in his place and time, a man trained, as every one of us inevitably is the problems and feelings of his time and seeking his way of solving them. It's not so much in the Lincoln Fonda's words and actions, but in the face, the reactions of the players support that Ford tells the story of the formation of the Lincoln youth world, the essence of place in society and politely, and in how The people responding to Mr. Lincoln said and their actions were trusted by the men who were deemed to have honored them with heeding. <br /> <br /> Give this a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you see 'Young Mr. Lincoln' change your focus to the supported characters - you will, I hope, be rewarded with a Deeper appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford's storytelling of the characters 'support of the Lincoln Fonda could appeal to David Lean when he led Omar Sharif to' Doctor Zhivago ', in which he's the reaction of characters supporting' Zhivago who actually said about Zhivago.
