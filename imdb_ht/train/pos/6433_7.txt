Several posters notes Renoir's voice of desire to make a movie that shows Ingrid Bergman smiling in cameras. The short answer would not be our all the harsh fact that only a few choices were made to do so. At this stage of Bergman career she could not get arrested; In 1949 he left Hollywood making a photo in Europe, dropped to director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy it was probably ready to open a vein but in the year, after doing this for Renoir, it was back where he belonged to an Oscar boots for Anastasia. This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and its balance to better than the Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and about the same with French Does Can. Renoir probably figured out that and many went for Bergman and he could get away with a couple of gentleman guys and Renoir taking two toys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content giving it a once-over-lightweight and focused on replicating the paintings of his father to set up after setting up. In her pastel colors, she looks like another movie in the Grand Prix of Maneuvers. All in all it remains a cute trifle to show off a beautiful and charisma actress.
