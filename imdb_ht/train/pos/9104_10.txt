Well I do not agree with the comment other posting. Piedras is best to magnolia or any of the other films that have been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially on characters that are not real, I think someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the Hispanic society like I did (and I'm not Hispanic), is a movie very real and real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> There is a European movie Unlike an American movie, our well-known social corporation, personally my American movie movie movie a lot (I love the classic and some of the American American films but are very few). <br /> Is it a movie about the continuous constitution of a person, love or not all to make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes.
