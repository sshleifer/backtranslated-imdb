I liked this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the draw had some torsion beautiful and spin, and the characters were well rounded. On the front, however, "Rob Roy" scored higher than average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of dialogue was so high. There were plenty of verbal talk and voice to accompany the brilliant choreograde swordplay. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this movie understands a principle rarely acknowledged any more. For a drama to succeed, he needs not only a hero, but a cruel truly credible. If you do not have one, there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but the three - Earl of Montrose, Kilairn henchman, and Archie. Not a dimension of one dimension, either but completely flesh and very nasty. It takes a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - there are more dialogues, and their accents are a bit tricky, but it's a much smarter and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
