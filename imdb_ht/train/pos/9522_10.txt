This is the first Tom Hanks movie I have the privilege to see in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a hit-man, I was a little stunned thinking "can Mr. Hanks pull this one off"? And he did in high fashion. The 1930s depression film is a loyalty, redemption, and one way that you do not want your child to stumble. Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan. Being the family, and the secret life of the contract killer for Oscar nominated Paul Newman. This movie Tom Hanks depends more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue, which he delivers a knockout performance. In one night at one of his works, Michael Michael, son of Michael Jr, played by New Tyler Hoechlin, witnessed the hit. And partner Michael Sr. In crime, fellow actors Daniel Craig could not have this information out. So she wacked out the son and wife of Michael Sr., except Michael Jr. So the head for Chicago found Conner Rooney (son of Mr. Rooney Paul Newman). really thick from them as dad tries to put things right, even though child is set for the ride. While in this journey is very dangerous, someone has hired a hit for Michael Sr. The assassin would be the photographer of the deceased Harlen Maguire, played by a Jude spot stamp attached. The movie will have you feeling old days. And with the nice and haunted Oscar nomination Thomas Newman nominated the notes to go along with it, you can not help but appreciate this film from Oscar to win directors Sam Mendes. So sit back, and enjoy the wild ride.
