Well I did not know what the movie was going to do as I saw only a little clip but I thought it was going to be good and I was right I watched it twice in the day I got it well it is my favorite movie. <br /> I think Alison Lohan played a part of beth really well she is like an actress grille and the writer must have gone through a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the finish when Beth is in the hospital has 2 Horus observation after eating because iv said 1 home is OK and also that hospital does not help tummy as iv said that is probably why I'm still at home even that sister and mum would like to be hospitalized as i have bulimia but this is a gray film I recommend it to any one or a food disorder or for those who know some people with eating disorders as it can leave them in life a bully person and see the world how to do a bit on a movie grille and I recommend it to any one and any kind of person
