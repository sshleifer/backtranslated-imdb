I read more than 100 of Nancy Drew's books, and if you do not shine enough to catch over again, Nancy Drew film was at a young Nancy Drew, not 18-year-old who did not attend school that all of the books . This was when he was sixteen. So, naturally, it would not be as smart as one of the books considered it is only in the 10th grade. Other than that, I thought the movie was very nice. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. It was articulated, in character, and beautiful. I loved the sick that Nancy and Ned were around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship as they have in their books. It was a nice, PG movie that I am very enjoying because I, unlike most people, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or profanity.
