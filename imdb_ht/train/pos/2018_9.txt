I liked it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including Little Arthur) is amazing and thrilling. He could use a bit more screen for Frederick Lawrence's yummy (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "about it" since the very beginning of the movie. <br /> One of my most thrilled people through surprising and shocking and surprising trauma was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I worshiped him in Forsyte saga, and everything else I saw him in. But he outdoes himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not have his photograph playing a psycho-psychic like Arthur Huntingdon. But it does. And I love it. And I love her.
