The rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas arriving at the students. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a science professor of high school high school and baseball coaching. His team is losing weight until the team discovered that the coaches played in minor league and could throw a kilometer 98 mph. <br /> After sending keystrokes and a wager made, Jim agrees that if his team has the regional, he will try out for the bigger leagues. The movie tells the story from Jimmy being the boy to play in his first game of the students. It's a great aloud story with a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the film worth while, providing an emotional performance and supported by an excellent support throw including: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slowed, but it all works well in the end. Baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed, and portrayed excellent. The movie really is not about baseball but on one's quest to come to his dreams. It inspires, it's emotional, and it's funny. I love it, I hope you do. <br /> <br /> <br /> The rookie. Start: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> 4 of 5 Stars.
