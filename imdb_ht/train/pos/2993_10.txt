Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirty, Eugene Palette as the police gruff detective, Jack La Rue as the Italian "black" and of course, James Lee as "The Chinese Cook", this movie is the great mystery of the murder a locked room. For a movie in the early 1930's, this step by step "peeling of the guise of the mystery" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this movie, you do not have the advantage to know who the killer was in advance.
