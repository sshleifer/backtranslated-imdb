The reason why I say this is because I wrote the scenario and knew very little about it being done until I asked them to see the movie. I wrote it to some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got heard about it. I was only writing a first draft so I understood to worry when I heard that he was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, of my agent, if he would like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I said, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name. I had no idea what to do in my scenario. Then I was invited to see the movie completed. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a very good piece of iron, from a very writable first draft to writing, I hope they are asked to do more work on it; Maybe if I had it it would not be so good. Would I like to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I would also like to see the movie again, I only see it once in a small theater in Soho.
