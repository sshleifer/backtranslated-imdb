Imagine being so intrigued by a bureaucracy that one person spends 8 years in his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case normally in itself! The murder technique is clear, but a government wants to admit the truth left by a monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think my job is stressful, I just remember the true story behind this wonder cops. The devotion of duty to the main masterful character was described by Rea. The comic (and almost tragic at times) the relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies in the last 5 years. Grabing one of the worst mass masters in history made me on the edge of my place. While not nearly as well publicized and speaking about as "the silence of the Lamb", the plot was just as thrilling. Rent or buy this movie today!
