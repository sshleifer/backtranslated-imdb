The episode of the epic one is a delightful holiday story of love, betrayal, ... and a homicide, the escape of dressing like Father Christmas. A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) just killed her on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a disruption, Santa Clause's wear set psychotropic (Larry Drake, perfectly on the head) threatens his life ... as well as its precious daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the way, this particular review will watch it every Christmas on routine. Most remarkable for scrambling suspicions and narrative twists, and throughout the Houst is among the best account of the Crypt.
