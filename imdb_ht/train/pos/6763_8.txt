Elegance and class are not always the first words that come in mind when (at least that might be something like that) sitting around and talking about noir movie. But some of the best films in the genre, "from the past," "The Killers," "in a single place," "Night and the City," managed a level of sweet away from a moody sentence phrase and its connotation in the foreboding shadows, fedoras, and femme-fatales. <br /> "Where the Sidewalk ends," a fairly tricky find film - the only copy of perhaps the best store video shop in Manhattan was a rough bootleg in the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category with these classic. At the time of the black cloud in the opening credit last, a curtain is drawing around Marc Dixon's detective detective, and as time passes, he's ever closer, asphyxi threat. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's accustomed to "cop with a dark past", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a weak and intense setback that makes you as comfortable as it looks. And yes, he was struck by suspicion for too long, and the newly encouraged ruler (Karl Malden, on a typically robust trip and order) is his warning "for the last time." But Dixon hates these villains too much to stop now. And boy did not they had it come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dust, mugs, nickel-rod bombs" her dog then hard black at a boss hugging her and rolling out all the complaints the office got on right Dixon hook a. The advice is for him to cool for his own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> What a world of trouble it finds when it relies on its instincts, and falls on a nature that can or may not have been passed down from a previous generation. <br /> <br /> Its far right is deep and the cops, the union, his own partner. Dixon's anxiety at an "murder" investigation threatens his work, making him wonder whether he is simply as the basis of what he swore to bring in. Like Bogart's "Lonely Place," can he "escape what he is?" / / <br /> When he has anywhere else to turn, he discovers that he normally finishes his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Tierney Gene) that looks like he can turn his life back to undergraduate in something that is worth to come home. <br /> <br /> Rally this superb movie is stiff and captivating. Groups of writers who contributed to the production of the polished script into a high glaze - the dialogue is dynamic without disassembly of dated parody fodder, enthusiastically without melodramatic or vampires. <br /> <br /> With all this head-tooth and acting is not too slick or buffed to loosen up the emotional movie. Angelic Gene Tierney's, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. She shows herself to be an actress of considerable series, with her gentle nature, she is as unlimited here as her psychosis is "leaving her in the sky." The scene between Dixon Tierney and Andrews has grown more intense and touches the closer it looks to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Near the end of his rope, cut, lean, and exhausted, Dixon summarizes his lot: "The innocent people can get in terrible jams, too," he said. "A fake movement and you're in mind." <br /> <br /> Perhaps that makes this movie totally compelling is the essence that things can go wildly for almost anyone - especially for someone who tries so hard to do right - with only one small change in the wind, one bad decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to your factor there is no control over. Noir has always reflected the dark fears, brought to the surface. "The Sidewalk End Location" does this in a realistic fashion. <br /> (One-picked at a sidewalk: This movie cinema movie has a nice dub dub of a blonde model that would not seem out of place on mystery science theater. How very odd.) <br /> <br /> But NOIR fans - hey, any movie fans - who have not seen this one in for a terrific treaty.
