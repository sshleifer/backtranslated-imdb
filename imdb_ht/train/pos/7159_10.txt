Louis classical kids summon children are as Disney as Freddy Krueger. He had murder, racism, facial disfiguring and assassin killer. It's a multi-layered story, interlinking that covers stories revealing Stanley's legacy and secrecy behind the holes. It races from Latvia's Fertile Fertility to the pock-marked Camp Green Lake (hint: no lakes and no green). <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is to re-create the novel environment for persuasion - the design series is superb and intelligent. The other plus is in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Greenlight Project) could not be the fat boy in the book, but his attitude is right and it is far from the usual clean-cut hero. The rest cast filters equally well, from Patricia Arquette as Frontier Marine-spin-steamer to Henry Winkler as Stanley's father. The downside is the pop band - most marketing department - and whose sentiment has returned to full volume at the end.
