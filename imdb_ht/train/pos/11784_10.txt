As well documented by previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - and, indeed, at the end, Rockstar: Supernova - is Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not know who they are? They are fabulous, tight, Rockin 'House Band that has savvy music and talent has made this show something more than a sad American Idol script. <br /> <br /> Remember the "strings" night? That was the precision of music and perfection if I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil's Caution Makeover of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Bohemian, covers Ty Taylor's memorable to the stones 'You can not always find ...', JD Fortune songs "Suspected Spirit". The common denominator here is the Awesome House House. <br /> As good as the INXS were in their prime, sadly a shadow of the senior heads, though JD's live performances somewhat suffer new life in their music, this show is all about the HB. <br /> <br /> Memo Producer: Season Three (if we're blessed enough to have it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Finding these boys a good lead singer and will place.
