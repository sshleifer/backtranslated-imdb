A single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself working several minimal-earned jobs. When he was shot, he found that he could not support his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter who had asthma. Then she goes to her friends and starts selling drugs. Soon enough, it gets addicted to the drugs that it is selling. His life comes crashing, especially when his children, that is, his oldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave him. Then he struggles to redeem himself with the help of his children, but can protect his family from the drug chief who he worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has some of the best act I've ever seen! Diane Keaton releases a lot, and her character comes as crazy but it was very compelling. It is best suited to drama than comedy. However, the best performance of the movie from Michael Seater, which plays his oldest son. It is perfect as a responsible young son but is trying to be the adult in the family. His acting was especially great at the scenes where he met his mother on the drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the youngest boy, also does a good job. <br /> A well worth watching movie, especially because of the acting of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
