Eye Red is a thrilling film by creator Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven painted the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decided to take flight from the red eye. While waiting, he meets the man named Jack Rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) And they are sort of becoming friends. Ironically, both sit right next to each other on this aircraft. Then this is when the horror begins. This movie is typing with the weak hearts who do not like movie / movie films, as well as allowing it to be able to peer into the pants. This is an excellent example of a shaky production bone. Wes Craven has done well with this movie. She chose the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, an intelligent girl, sexy who knows what she is doing and is cautious of everything when she acts in a movie. Cillian Murphy, scary and horrendous actor who can chew your bone to his amazing being was the bad character of this movie, and his face can really raise your eyes. Wes Craven has done an excellent job and I hope he does more movies like this one.
