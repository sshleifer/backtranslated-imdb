Pendragon Photo 'new film' H G Wells 'War of the Worlds', the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theater release was held earlier this year (March 2005), but that never happened. The DVD was run out to coincide with the liberation version of the verb, which hit the theater on June 29. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, with certain reservations. ? It's not quite 100% faithful to Wells' books, but 90 - 95% faithful are good for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy Astronomer's Conflict and a Farmer, and the writer's name / recorded awkwardly had with his cousin. But on the whole, this movie follows the book very tight - certainly more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal. <br /> <br /> Its biggest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. The majority of it seems to have shot blue-screen and composite and digitally rendered origin. This is particularly annoying during most of the inner shots, and street scene crowded streets. The overview of 1898 London looks like something from a video game. Many horses horses were false - I guess they could not afford to rent a horse. The only scenes that shoot for "real" seem to be people in open fields or forests. <br /> But in these budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. Artistic, the movie looks good. The Martian and Justin are well-done, and indeed true of Wells' description. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should be one of the film's films, is a bit disappointing. It's a great shame that they could not afford more current sets, or better quality animation. <br /> <br /> The act and direction will not win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not exceptional. The music is also good, but not on a par with any of Hollywood's greatest composers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually happy this did not get a theater release, because the budget limitation would make it look worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would rate this similarly to an BBC-TV adaptation of classical literature. <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks: Most of the scenes are presented with various color filters (mostly red). This could be an artistic choice, but it is used very consistently, and it looks more like a sloppy job in mastering the DVD. With the extreme writer / narrower mustache from the stage scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Is it worth seeing? If you can watch over the technical and budget limits, and find out in the story, I think you'll enjoy this, especially if you were actually reading the original H G Wells novel. If, however, you are easily cut by cheap production value, you would be better off than this (unless you're a MST3K fan). You must be warned, however, that the movie runs a full 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching it all in one sitting. <br /> BTW: An entirely different version of the world wars (aka "Invasion") came out on DVD in the same month as the gameberg hit theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. This was also done on a budget but is updated the present day like the Spielberg movie - but it's best! And by itself off, Jeff Wayne is doing an animated film at her best-selling album from 1978, but that will not come out until 2007.
