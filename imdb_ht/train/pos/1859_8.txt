In his debut, Denzel Washington has taken a true story that also has a very tough story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this as a director . <br /> <br /> Recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen into the cracks in public safety. This story tells of a nightmare that leaves the terrible marks but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can stimulate choices on some first-hand issues and too many ups closed and not the best in correcting these scenes but simplifying other scenes that such projects may not be understated. <br /> <br /> If the academy neglected this film it will be travesti. This film pulls no punches and goes to make the cold cold in the story with a purity that usually does not exceed a screen woman's. This, of course, is a tribute to the Director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too!
