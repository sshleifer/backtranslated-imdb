Given how these movies are, you have to face the faces that they have had fun making. The movie focuses on a strange home to accommodate anyone who lives there. The inhabitants were: Author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (and hair!)), Who gets haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's meaning is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the way to get a little too much of character. <br /> <br /> The "dirty house" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it's star Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from being clean, there may be some abondones: it might call into question the issue of real supremacy horrors supposed to be horrific. Like in the "shining", we might ask if the home / hotel itself keeps some memories of past events. But if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's co-star) is hot HOT HOT! Around this time came out, he also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as a queen, but mark my words: SE is a QUEEN HOT SCREAM! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something. <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh well. A very cool movie.
