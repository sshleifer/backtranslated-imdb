Overall I found this movie quite fun and fun to look, and lots of laughs out loud moments. <br /> But this movie is not for everyone. That's why I created this quick question, if you answered yes to any of these questions, I recommend watching this flicker <br /> <br /> (1) Do you enjoy brutal sexual humor? (2) Do you love alcohol-related humor? (2) Do you like amazingly hot girls? (3) Do you like to look sacred? (4) Do you like to watch several holes? (5) Did I mention all these beautiful films in this movie? <br /> <br /> If you notice the traffic jam, which refers to the amount of nuts you can expect from the movie, I also have no idea what the plot was about. Not that it's important.
