I did not know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly, but absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and captivating. He also felt very authentic, I felt that I had been transporting back in the 1800s. I've never been a lot of a Heath Ledger fan, he has only seen him in childhood movies, however he is quite compelling in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very spirited boy became the most notorious Australian killer. Naomi Watts is great in a support role as Kelly's lover society. Very recommended - and that's from an Aussie!
