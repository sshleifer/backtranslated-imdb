what can I say about this movie that has not already been said? well said the truth many of it looks very frail like some of the bumpers and kicks. how charlie sheen though this was real i do not know. I'm sure they should hit and kick off it harder if it was. However the scenes with the pinch and the hot oil look very real. with the final needle in the eye stinging scene and is probably the only thing on film that has ever shocked me.
