I was waiting to see this movie from a long time. It's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I really got it well done. Most of the conventional romantic cinema ends with lovers are finally married or staring at with a happy life after marriage, but there is really a great adjustment needed for the transition from an old life into a new relationship with life. This is what this movie is all about the period when a newly married couple Fardeen and Esha get married in a row wedding and start their life with bees. The act is really spell mandatory if I think Esha is a bit quiet and could have used some lines for herself. The story was well knitted and dialogue was more or less appropriate. The correction and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a great job here. To summarize I would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean art.
