I can not believe we do not have 70 shows again. I have all 8 episodes in this 70 show !! I absolutely love it! I'm lying in the bed every night and watching several bouts before I go to bed. At the end of a busy day it's good to kick back and have a big laugh before going to sleep. I was sad so they took the show when ... at least we still have to re-run them !! I hope and the prayers will be back and at least a meeting ... Like maybe Donna ends college and we finally get to see her with Eric married !!!! Should not be scared? It would be even better if they would continue for years!
