If I watch a movie and not once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will run or when I hope the last scene was not the end of the movie, he had to be very good. I'm not an original film or censorist movie. I watch movies and if they keep me interested until the end, then they are very good because some of the most acclaimed acclaimed films make me of death (English, Shakespeare's love of love, Atonement, this crash film keeps me interested and absorbs the beginning of the end. Encourage is great, history is absolutely original, flash-back techniques are highly affected .. There was a bit of Kane Citizens threw into tho when Hoffman rubbed his apartment after Tomei left him, but I forgive that cause I see it as a homage, rather than a rip-off in Orson.
