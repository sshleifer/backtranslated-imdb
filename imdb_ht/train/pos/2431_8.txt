Famous was "famous" for the tensions and release style of the cartoon where the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to be saved by the hero in the last second. Casper this particular is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death, there is still a happy end. <br /> <br /> The constant design of the famous Studios is that "virtue is always triumphant". Popeye always comes to her spinach in time, Huey's baby is still out-of-fox, Little Audery always "learns her lesson". And some FS cartoons are really black and depressing. <br /> You have to give them credit. As much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I do not think anyone who has put out a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing, voice. They were consistent with a glowing example of better than the art form offered.
