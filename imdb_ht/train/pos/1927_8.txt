With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this most exciting program, which, though it had only a short run, was a tremendous idea and good story line at all. Usually unseen for over 40 years it would be worth considering again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a snippet of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, riding his famed renowned sledge, to the point where he was often referred to as the "Fastest Alive Man".
