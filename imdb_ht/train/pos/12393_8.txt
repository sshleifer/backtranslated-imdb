For those who are interested in knowing how exactly humanity has become safe in large red pods that make me eager to grenades, there are duo in the "Second Renaissance" shorts. I'm not exactly sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they're credited as one on the DVD (and are these shorts seen on any other format but the DVD?), But they're informative even if they have a some disturbances. <br /> What really does this part first stand out, from the second part to the rest of the animations as well, is the parallel it shows between uprising robots and civil rights. Disclosures of slavery graphs, fascism, concentration camps, and wild graves are mixed with verbal references to the million-million million and human-complexity of mankind. In fact, "God" is never really referenced by these shorts, rather replaced by "Man's own image". <br /> <br /> As far as the shorts go to the collection, the "Renaissance of Second: Part I" is by far the most effective in carrying out emotions. It is a painful and disturbing way of the potential of mankind to become the "architect of its own destruction." Some may be hindered by some of this concept of short rattle directly from literature that has already established science fiction, but then again, that's basically what most of the Matrix series did, and it was a Force drives behind its success. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
