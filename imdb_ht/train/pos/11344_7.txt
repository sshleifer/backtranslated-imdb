Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have many fans, and stay alive, memorize it. Seeing this as an adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - as the little twin witch Jimmy worn off with Witch Hazel (Cass) sneers "I know he had brown roots!" . It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some quite progressive ways. The Different Trace, for example, sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the package, and cherishing what's different about yourself. This would be a humorous to the gay community, it should be great track. Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches, and cast in Living Living giving it all in the defining of their character's costumes (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There is a lot of about the act of this movie - there's really nothing subtle, and when Jack Jack has been hugging her anxiety for residents kidnapped at Living Island it's really little more than crying. This is drama and comedy spread over with a trowel. While I think of it - I can never stand the flute though. <br /> I love the band, especially mentioned above, but also the Zap World, Pufnstuf and even touch the Wild Jack if I could. What's more, it is now out on CD from the tasteful people at El Alb√≤m in London. See here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
