Wendigo is a very good psychological thriller, the movie has some great dramas between the characters and some good creepy scenes. Acting is a good thing, the characters act as a normal family. Wendigo's effects are good, the shape of Deer reminded me a little bit of the rabbit of Donnie Darko. The movie sees a family going to stay in a temporary home, but casual hit a deer, a group of hunter arrives and one of the hunters named Otis begins to discuss with George's father, after the car rises to the drive the House.
