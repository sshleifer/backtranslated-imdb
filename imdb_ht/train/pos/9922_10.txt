This is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentation such as the "Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." Its comments are clear and unconditional as the Cinematic style is the style that is well-fabricated. The movie manages to impose a powerful sense of how unstable our world is as we rush towards a sustainable environment in lightning speed - while showing us the dire beauty of our pursuit progress. <br /> Surely a remarkable achievement is to be seen by all who care about the world we have left our children. Bravo! <br /> NB - this is also the only movie (of 8) in the Varsity Theater (Toronto) boasting a tag-on tag that reads ... "To arrange group watch please contact ...." an additional test of popularity and importance of this gem. <br /> <br /> My Paris ... an award-winning academy for best documentary. <br /> <br /> OB101
