While most people watch the movie, this will be of little interest, but from the many hundreds of movies related to magic and the occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways. From the Craft Golfer the topic seems to be in endless interest in the film industry. The majority of movies that touch on it in any way do small children (for example, "Witchboard", a true piece of utter garbage in any way) either capture the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for special cheese effects or cardboard boxes ( CF "Warlock"). More often the subject comes in the context of historical religious context (in various revelations-oriented movies, the Antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new-age practice style). Rarely, a movie seems to show at least some past and magical experiences as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in the films can best be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, or. just right. <br /> I watch this movie again after many years tonight. I've seen it before on VHS; It's a black piece, moody, and after watching it on DVD, I would say if you have any intention to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch it on VHS. Darkness and humidity are the potency of VHS, but the DVD movie takes on a very different tone. I think Weir pushes the dark aspects intentionally for style, but when the movie is converted into the lower color medium of this VHS goes on the edge. DVD brings the movie to life again and I've seen it differently. Anyway, seeing it as if for the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is very good in this movie. It's hard to go through all the reasons, I'm not busy taking the time to do this. <br /> For anyone in curious, anyway, if you want to see what it is like in real life, this movie is just pretty right on countless levels. <br /> And for anybody else, you really waste your time at this point.
