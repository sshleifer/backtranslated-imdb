I found this a very fun little movie that is currently gearing up for adults and a lot of jokes and humor only to understand. A few things are suitable for kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, the "Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks many jokes you can not keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural-insider-Hollywood racial. The movie is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of the little ones in here are fun to see. Anthony Hopkins' voice is fun, too, so has to tell him that he's raising the movie more. Its rhyme is fun to hear. <br /> I saw this in the theater, though it was "just," but on DVD, it was far better. I saw in three times and it was best every time.
