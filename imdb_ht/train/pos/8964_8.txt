Not a few cheerful coincidence the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's former "Vertigo" chief, they also made this light comedy. Maybe the actors need to do it after undergoing the film's accuracy in Hitchcock. At any rate this a great companion piece of "vintage" as it yet explores a very-powerful but powerful romance. In fact, the film can be seen as the flip side of "Vertigo" and is happy to finish. Here again Novak underwent a transformation, in Vertigo it essentially plays two women and here it 'transforms' from mortal witch. Stewart is again sheltered and temporarily suffers from his love for her. Unlike the Vertigo two comes together in "Bell Books and Candles", a perfect antidote for the Hitcock movie. Again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in a whole vein. Throw is terrific. Lemmon hilarious as Warak Novak's brother and Elsa Lancaster give a classic performance as the Aunt. Ernie Kovacs as the script writer extract and of course Hermoine Gingold plays Novak's great competitor. The scene and Stewart drink the portion is the best comedy. Anyone who saw Vertigo or even though you should not see this memorable light actress.
