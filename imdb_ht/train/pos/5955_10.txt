As the marker of "Darkness," I admit we neglected 3 very important recognition in our end credit. The omissions were subdued that could not be corrected once committed, nor was the involved parties --- who saw the film --- to mention it at the moment. In the name of the excellent cast and crew of the movie, I extended an apology. Obviously, some critics posted here are difficult to light in their credit score being accidentally. Our production value was negligible and our "special effects" were quite special indeed, but the very strong plot and the cinematography by John McLeod is superb. We hope you, the reader, enjoy this "Darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked aside for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
