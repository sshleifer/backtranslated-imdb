Wow, I loved this movie. It may have not had the funding and advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters find but it packs twice the emotional punch. The story revolves around a family from Utah and it's the connection between the family who gives the movie and its punch. The main tree (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his party very well, in no time does he let you believe he acts all his feelings. He's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me though. When the two were in scene together they limited the lines off to each other, giving fantastic performance. Great cast, big movie.
