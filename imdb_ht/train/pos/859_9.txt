It is so rare to find a movie that gives a plot that can not be calculated from every turn. A couple of things I could not quite understand though is that here you have to lead the female character who plays "the good girl, hard worker" and again in the end she ends up being a person take social anti-social risks. It was not enough for me to love it though but it made me pause. <br /> <br /> Other things I could not get were the old man who was being scattered away by the police at the end of the movie. I never found out who he or what his problem was. If anyone has any idea, I would like to hear what they might be. The movie was fun and fun at all and always let me guess. Very worth seeing.
