This film is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolve. <br /> I warn viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spyware and Ms Liu is there, it moves in a deftly targeted yet sedate speed. It's not about explosions, cars chases, or flying bullets. Be patient and rather, remember the details here. It sedate because that is the main character is. The viewer has his WATCH and thinks like this unfolding story. <br /> I'm not going to give defurators - because that destroys the point of watching. The plot is what you read in the other posters: an average white-collar guy, seeking change and adventure, sign for a corporate spy work. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit within the data. <br /> <br /> This movie begins in a surreal walk - with a background tang of entertaining corporate entrepreneur who empowers himself with excellence, hides suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. The act on every part is superb - and yes, some of the karikatur characters act. But they all fit and enjoy. With the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft, soft key theme disaster: Everything is not good at the start. <br /> <br /> And in the end: Everything is not similar. /> <br /> Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one - and turn up the sound: This movie wants you to listen.
