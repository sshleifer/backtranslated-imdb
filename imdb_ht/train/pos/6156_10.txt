This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th anniversary of this movie DVD. WOW I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great, It has an extra 30 min that the original did not have. I did not know this when I first started watching. The film has been doing so much more ever since. The music was cut out should be left in. You have not seen this movie until you've seen the full version of 131 min. A lot of people say that the music is forgettable. I remember every song in this movie by heart, each song has its own charm not itself, and it comes together as a hole. I remember when I was younger I had the "Eglantine" song stuck in my head for days at a time. As well as "Briny Sea" (which song meant for married couples but was cut off from the movie) Please watch the new 30th film film in reiterating and re-voting for this movie. 10 that it really is.
