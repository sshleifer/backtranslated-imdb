It's hard to tell you more about this movie without breaking it. I loved it because I did not expect what I saw, but an ordinary sex-drama so ... It's a pscyho-sexual comedy, in which nothing is what it looks like. He presents Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger in the genre (and in the nude) in which her husband, Polanski, ruled him. With a creepy performance (I say creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (the actor Bernard Tavernier). It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), such as a Chabrol gone or Clouzot thriller (I saw someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to George Yeanj's unspoiled Visage Georges Franju (Bloody Eyes a figure, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just scared they'll blow this into a Hollywood renewal like they did with Nighwatch and the Disappear.
