Three flash-backs feature the main characters (Abu, Jaffar, and the Princess) who will communicate with Ahmad; Three are the songs, each linked with those same characters. Three times Ahmad pronounces the word 'absolute' the word, in his statement to love the princess, answering three questions in the first of three meetings. So strong is the impression it causes, that the princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer it - by three successive ploys: misleading, hypnosis, and delusional memory. But Jaffar owns what he describes as the three instruments incapable of dominating a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three are the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse, the genius, and the genius and the magic carpet. The engineering offers three volumes of Abu in the first of three encounters; Three times the genius laughed loudly into the hills, and the three considered it to human brittle, before it was part. Abu has three obstacles in the temple at dawn (army guards, giant-spider, and giant-octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that carries it just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow-and-arrow to execute Jaffar. There are magic in the number three, and there are magic in this movie.
