It's like movies that make you want that you never take over the growing nerve in the school. If you liked this movie, then I would suggest you look at Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released that's a shame since he did a great job. I wonder if it's because of the part he plays in the movie. It starts out when Carol tricks her into the entrance of the toilet girls to act like they were about to do it. When it was changed in the showers, popular friend Carols jumped in the bathroom with everything ready, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opened the naked curtain of the naked she realized he was misleading. She tries to cover the shower up, but the kids open it, catching Marty and starting to say it while the camera rolls. They took him, dunked himself in the toliet while being flotted, and his electricity (a little). When the children in detention, given in the coach, 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him throw. Jumping broke one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the professor excuse him. While Marty is puking in the bathroom Skip sneaks through the science lab and mix some things that look like cocaine, but not sure what it was. The lab breaks disfigured it seriously. 5 years later children who suffered him were invited to a 5-year school meeting in the old school that had burned on that day it exploded. No one is found to kill them. I do not understand how the drowning girl really drowned. he could get back up after Marty left. He almost got out the first time.
