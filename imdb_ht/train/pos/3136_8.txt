A strangely enjoyable effort, combining a far-reaching plot involving Adam and Burt with the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were raised directly in Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in the Coast" and I imagined the book was the inspiration for making this movie. As with the book, she left fans of the original serious ceremony for more. <br /> <br /> If you miss this broadcast, it's definitely worth the effort to borrow a tap from a friend who can register it. I make a copy for my kids now.
