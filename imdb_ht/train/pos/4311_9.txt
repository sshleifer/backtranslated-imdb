This work has less of Steve Martin's Davis character, than it's about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue via Davis elements meditates, contemplative, near-poetic Existentialism at its best. It is witty, smart, and thoughtful in dialogue delivery and content. The writers deserve an Oscar. Performance is easy, relaxed, and natural; just what you would expect from "A list" actor. Martin contributes the performance that leads to her more recent shop, guides you to life, love, and pursuit of wisdom if not happiness. Kline is right - the suit - the conformist of the film, and as such his performance is dry and refreshing. This work deals with life in every aspect. It indicates a real emotional investment of its characters, and leaves you feeling that humanity does not end, after all, no matter what you believe, deep down. <br /> At all? This is delightful, with a fearless moment or two, with easy natural dialogue that draws you to, helping its audience to take a great pleasure from this work. It's definitely worth your time, though it may not be the top one's choice as Friday / Saturday night. <br /> I really enjoyed this intelligence. It's not typical, and it was an unexpected surprise. Another nice surprise was the honesty of the document. Couples and friends keep their conversations, feel and sound completely honest and (yet) natural. I was very impressed with this work, and will add it to the DVD collection soon. <br /> It rates an 9.1 / 10 from ....
