This is my list of all-time favorite movie! It's a fantastic movie with perspicaces. It was historically interesting and great to look! I thought the act from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were gorgeous and the environments and scenes like the opera house, were amazing and detailed. I just liked it, all of it! I liked the scenes of the children she was getting 'intimidated' by John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult. One more writers did it! They produce this fantastic script! <br /> It's well worth the awards they've received. (Oscar and BAFTA shine Sandy Powell, for costume design .. A BAFTA for best make-up and hair, an Oscar in best achievements in art direction, best achievements in costume suits, best achievements in makeup design nominated for Best Emily Blunt actress .. CDG for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Period .The Hampton 's International Film Festival for a Public Award for Best Narrative.PFCS Film for Best Costume Costume.Sudbury Cinefest, does not say so. VFCC for Best Actress, Emily Blunt.) Overall 10 wins and 11 nominations! That's very good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Have a look yourself, it's really interesting! Personally Rupert Friends should have a prize.
