Not sure if this counts as a shingle or not, so beware: <br /> Just a small but crucial thing to look for, an intriguing possibility: boys have stolen a green Citroen at one point, for a ride happy, and return it to the owner he made goals and vengeful hidden damage to the car, hoping that the landlord will crash. Is it the very same car stolen much later in the picnicking family? We know the original owner sells it. They drive in the end on a dangerous road, one that I understand was close to all pedestrians for the last ten years. A whole slant at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> On another subject, this film could be called "center of a woman". I do not remember another movie, certainly by Americans, who treated the schedule of a woman in such a Franky style and opened, much like the "nose" of a fine Bordeaux.
