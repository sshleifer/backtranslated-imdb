The third Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than but across the table and the princess comes across. It is yet another adaptation of the game Burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day. The original Burlesque game runs on Broadway in the season 1927-1928 for 372 performances and it's the role that Carole Lombard plays that Barbara Stanwyck out on Broadway who brought her to Hollywood. A playwright version of Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey was still another version of it when my baby smiled at me. <br /> <br /> In fact I have a vinyl album in a radio version of Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler made for the Lux Radio Theater. This is an interesting job, believe me. Anyway MacMurray and Lombard are fine by the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Notice a wonderful performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin Vixen who gets between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of her earliest films as a wolf in the making of Lombard. Swing High, Low Swing keeps up real pretty today and I would not be surprised if we see yet another version of Burlesque for the Twenty-first Century.
