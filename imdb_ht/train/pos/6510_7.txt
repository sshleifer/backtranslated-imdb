I actually really love what I've seen in this cartoon so far. Sure, the animation is not the best, but honestly, I'd rather see this type of more cartoony style to do quickly and cheaply than the old type of style to do quickly and cheaply (which began to happen more and more often - it is only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it). There is nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black-dot eyes - in fact, I think it's really nice. As a kid I never thought the design of Scooby-Doo was particularly adorable, but I think I would like it to know better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think it has the potential for some depth. Sure, the show by center around the original "Mystery-Resolved" theme, but that's just a tired old formula anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers from there who could bring a lot more interest to traditional Mystery Inc. (which was missing as delay), but in the meantime this show is a fun deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are always funny, but not just funny rescue. They are still loose, but have finally the opportunity to use similar (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old over-food slackers as ever, but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of Albert Albert's legacy. <br /> I used to find the most original scooby-doo joke to be the best cheese and hilarious impulse at best, but this show actually exercised a real humor ability. Also, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy anyway, so the new actor does not annoy me as much as he does others. (I always think that Billy West was the best, though) <br /> Overall, while not a great cartoon in scrutiny of all story drawings, is still a success among other Scooby incarnations.
