I was in a bad frame of mind when I saw this movie first. For some reason it's clicking on all of my levels, tensions in a family, loneliness and wanting someone to share your life with. It did not hurt someone to share your life and was like a pretty girl like Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the sound track in this movie (very difficult to find). Love it and hope it will be a day out on DV
