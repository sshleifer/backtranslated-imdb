I was about 11 years old I found out I'm living 0.48 miles from home to uncle. The Uncle House is on Westway Dr., Deer Park, TX. Added houses since the movie was made. I do not know the house number but you can go see it. I am now 21 and I enjoy watching this movie. The bar on Spencer is not yet. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school. I drove home last week the house always looks great. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors coming in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where John crossed over the slopes were made 225 higher. when I heard about his son John loesing I start thinking about when he made urban cowboy it was 26 or 25 at the time.
