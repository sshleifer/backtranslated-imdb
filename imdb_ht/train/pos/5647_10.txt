I do not want to make everyone do not repeat what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have good sense of picking up and starting the series again. The good news is that it is OUT on DVD !!!! I run down to the store and pick up a copy and I'm glad it's just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a beautiful dark and crappy character, and all actors are very good. It's a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who loves the genre and who has not seen it, must do that. You will not be disappointed. My daughter was too young to see her when she was on TV (she is 20) becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. He finds it "very twist" and has enjoyed the episodes he has seen. I can not wait to see the episodes that have not been disclosed. <br /> This rock show !!!!
