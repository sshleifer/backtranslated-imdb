One of the joys of picking up the latest Bela Lugosi collection will come to see the delightful cinema as the Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team up in a film that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd (especially the Karloff technique camera, as Janos Rukh, uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and outright mockingly, I did not take care of the lease because the movie is quite enjoyable. Effects are done well for the time, the act is great, and the finish is particularly strong. He reminds me of the comic and sci-fi sci-fi sci-fi in the 1940s and '50s, filled with ray gun and ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
