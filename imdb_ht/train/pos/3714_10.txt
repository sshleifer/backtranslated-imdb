First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. Whenever someone brings back a cult of genre and adapts it to the present, something becomes unexplained loss of the translation. br /> <br /> That's not the case here. This movie just starts on the right track. It's part of territory habitually but manages to take it on the head as well. Crockzilla staged anyone? That must be seen, and just try and keep a right figure. This film takes some of the classic classic classic cinemas and manages its blend of transparency in a modern production. It's good to see someone is filling the need in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
