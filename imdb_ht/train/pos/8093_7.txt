My friend had the idea to watch the animated LOTR after seeing Peter Jackson back to the King. So I finally bought it through e-Bay, thinking right from the start it went to suck. Actually, it really was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, using a unique method of mixing live action and animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice for Frodo sounded like Eliya Wood. Larger adaptations in a book, but trust me, I've seen a lot worse. It skips quite a lot of things, since both Fellowship and the Towers are compressed into one of two hours film. Definatley is worth a look, the kids would love, but still, Absoutley has no complement to Peter Jackson's trilogy.
