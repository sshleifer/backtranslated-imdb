Anyone who finds it interesting that the Ood looks strangely similar to 'Great Cthulhu' of H P Lovecraft ancient? hmmm? (Do not refer to Billie Piper as most seem to do!) To the planet impossible and the devil's hole. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I also think of the Who who first and also referred to Satan in various post eroticism epochs ... <br /> <br /> Great episodic suspense use fear and element of faith. The new team for those 'working great magic for TV. This certainly creates new fear and 'hiding behind sofa' feelings that are not seen for many, many years in this continuation of a superb BBC series (pity it confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper will leave - maybe not permanent - after the end set 2): O (((
