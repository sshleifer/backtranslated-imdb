Andi MacDowell visual expressions are great again in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been temporarily (or all your life) you may feel you are wasting away. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your lantern is active active. I liked the quick sexual encounters, which must be from character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). Her former student is pretty good, always carrying a break on her teacher for long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought rather unrealistic or unpractical, though. For example, in a scene where other women envy over the decision and a scene put up to make Andie MacDowell cast the young man, would be a mature police officer (friend of others in MacDowell) allowing his friends to make such an act mess? Is it so easy for anyone not to stop in front of a car? In crash accident all the time, but I was hoping to see the heroine get happily married to the first man he participated in (that was the hardest part to believe !! For such a beautiful woman stay one for so long?) ... Maybe movie producers are aware of the fact that many romances between an older woman and a smaller man do not last for long. In addition to knowing that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially in envy over 40, who are waiting for some miracles happen. The sad end with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continues to live, would that last? How long? No one knows. However, it's a movie that you want to watch it again sometime later .... a year later maybe.
