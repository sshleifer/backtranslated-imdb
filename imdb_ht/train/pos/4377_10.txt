Earlier in the mid 90s was a high point, in my opinion, for the historic drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all describe a different passion and intensity in their respective periods. Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste at a time and place rarely represented by films. It really has everything - interesting stories, great acting, remarkable dialogue, and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialogue. I can imagine this is how early 18th-century people spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity to express the characters. I found it to be more crowded and shocking, albeit often more subtle, than most found in films put in modern times. The movie has a lot of squares and sexual charges loaded into it that was unique and likely to be realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight, and hardly a dull moment. There was plenty of intrigue and political subplot that complicated things a bit, but yet did not detect from the main storyline. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and entertaining. Something that I will forever find remarkable is that during the piece of action record in the movie, there is no band. It does for a very turbulent, exciting sequence, since we have no cue music as in the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always stay high on my list of favorite films. I would recommend it to all.
