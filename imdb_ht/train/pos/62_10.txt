I absolutely love this movie. I bought it as soon as I could get a copy of it. This film has many emotions, and felt so real, I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I look at it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip, and as I would feel if the same thing happened to me. <br /> I think all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep those who do not want to do the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and anybody. Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting. <br /> It really is one of the greatest movies of all time.
