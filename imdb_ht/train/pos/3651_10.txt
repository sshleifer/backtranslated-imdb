Pandora's Clock is among the best stairs you'll ever read and this is one of the best stairs you'll ever see. A very loyal adaptation of Jan J. Nance's novel, which has a frightfully realistic novel in the novel, has made even more so here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for TV, this is the first entertainment rate. The cast is great and slippery in the novel character so well as you would think the novel was read. Richard Dean Anderson steps out step outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance in his career to date. Jane Leeves is her great role as assistant ambassador in a role that she can prove to be a good actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, she works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the cast of support are top notch and fit the novel counterparts to read his letters. There are some changes in the history of course (including with a slight change at the end) but the changes for the better when compared to the novel. The plot is realistic and many see in believing the way it is presented to make this movie the best airline since the original airport movie. The production values ​​are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they worked fine. Together they are great, especially CIA HQ and Oval Office showing that filmmakers have spent a great deal of time doing this job. <br /> It does not matter if you see this first and then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will not regret losing four hours of this movie and however time it takes its novel. This will leave you breathless.
