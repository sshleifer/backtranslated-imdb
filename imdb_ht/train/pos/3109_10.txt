The third and last movie of this trilogy is finally clear crystals. It's a political film more than a plain entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and will discover and remember the torture that he had submitted to them in order to kill his old identity: he really killed one who became his bodyguard. But the film is finally revealing that all this was organized and planned by the CIA in a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all US citizens who tried to prevent control of all the corporation by a established and limited group of people. Who was one major officer of the CIA up to 1980, when he became vice president? This goes along with what has been said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring the truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision regarding the CIA is a woman and woman to become Senate which involves a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; it's my mouth. In the US policy of fighting in the media and the media is essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. Currently, Hollywood and beyond intelligence, academies and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, with this particular film, to build the idea of ​​the liberal public coming from a woman and the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It's very fun and it has sweet fragrance at the end of a period and in the big few changes waiting for others to wait for, but no one can pretend it will not come up: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin in Yvelines
