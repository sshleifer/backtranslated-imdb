Elvira, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> led by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> begins: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene, and Edie McClurg <br /> Drawings: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits his TV show and headquarters Christian Fallwell, Massachusettes to collect her husband's heritage heritage, hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is an old house climbing, a poodle, and a magical meal. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, breathing some life into adolescents, winning the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), avoiding being burned at the stake, and keeping the cookbook out of her climb uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who plans to use the book at the end of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I like both Cassandra Peterson and Elvira change-me. It's a very successful, beautiful, and humorous woman and as Elvira it's all that is more morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention having an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie, its charms are used to good use. <br /> I loved all 'fish out of the water' feeling in the movie. You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous twin, and she's in a Christian city where most of the girls are not even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes his love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is even big as Elvira's uncle Vincent / Nemesis, from stealing the book to use it for evil. She has a lot of attendance but she still does not get in the way and steals the Elvira scene. What really makes the movie is not the draw, but the many jokes. Everything from jokes to boobs in fragrance horror is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a FULL PHOTOGRAPHY movie. I hear there are about 56 bob jokes in this movie, and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you will love this flick of films.
