Cute movie about three living sisters from Switzerland (often seen running over to matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (looks like mother is still carrying torch for dad) - so they sail away to New York to stop the dad from getting a blonde gold-digger called "Precious". Father did not see her daughter in ten years, (oddly enough) does not seem to mind and thinks she is wonderful, and while Precious seems to lead a life primarily run by her mother (Alice Brady) a woman who just wants to see in her daughter getting married a rich man. Sisters get the idea of ​​pushing forward in the way of a county on the Hungarian soil, tricking the women-digging women into thinking it is one of the richest people in Europe. But an identification case makes the girls think that the count is a good-looking Ray Milland, who goes along with the plot 'cause he had a break on home. <br /> <br /> This movie is enjoyable, light fare. Barbara Li as Home Comes to All Like Sweet And Lovely, Ray Milland looks oh so young and beautiful here (though, unfortunately, given little to do), Alice Brady is as good as the mother tumbler - but she is Deanna Durbin , a real warmer and beautiful as a play play smaller younger Penny sister, who is pretty much steal the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the movie, though I actually would like to see them present it even more in this. The plot of this movie is a bit funny, but nevertheless, I found the movie to be fun and fun.
