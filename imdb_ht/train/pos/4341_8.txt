Who does not have problems with their parents? And what parent does not have unresolved problems? <br /> I know, that sounds heavy. But this played for laughing at the movie, making both the best comedy and the drama best. I was always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was somewhat concerned that the stars would be too big for a movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially fun were the discoveries that the son did about his father as a human. And monologue Peter Falk about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was perfect swinging the point. Without that scene they had acted well, the film would have seemed far to nuanced, and the character far less interesting. Nicely done, Paul and Peter!
