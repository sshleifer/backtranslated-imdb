I'd rated the perfect 10 series for exceptional and always high quality stories and character development has it was not for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! ! <br /> From the very end of the series, it's obvious that many of the history archives were originally programmed to reach at least one more season. I would think they rapidly accelerate these stories to the Stargate SG-1 franchise position for both direct-to-DVDs! Unless the return of Asgard to a SG-1 film in the future (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" disappearance), I think the fans have cheated with a poor clean-up in loose!
