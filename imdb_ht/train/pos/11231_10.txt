I really love Star Frontier Hidden Trunks is an excellent film fan movie and I cant wait to see more I've just started looking at this movie series last week and I just can not get enough of it. I have already recommended it too much to look at since it is worth noting. I have already watched every episode many times over and I'm waiting to see more episodes out. I rated it a ten, but I think she deserved a complimentary 12 loll from the Staff of Star Trek Frontiers to hide on an excellent job. If you like Star Star I highly recommend check out this movie star movie fiction cart. Details associated with this series of films are excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
