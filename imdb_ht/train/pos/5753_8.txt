*** 1/2 From ***** While I'm not concerned with the fact that this is an English version armed as some revisions have been mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to live in many Quebecois hearts . However, this was a movie like a kid that I was a fervent admirer at; Keeping in mind now that it's done for kids, I miss it on a relative basis. The story is in children in winter breaking up an awesome snow fort, with jostling back-ups for control of guns like snowballs and other concoctions, as idle hands and time free winter columns. If I had kids, this definitely is a movie I would try and get interested in, as the Snow Fort wowed me when I was young, and I think even today's kids would agree, albeit Pixar with all the computer animation, maybe I'm from date and just do not realize it. In addition, the movie's message is beautiful allegory and a positive one in that, for kids (and adults alike).
