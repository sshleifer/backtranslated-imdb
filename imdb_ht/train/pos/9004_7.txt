I had my doubts about another love story where people with disabilities find meaning and redemption in honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But their performance comes from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and this rescue from being just another tearful jerker. Carter's decision to an ALS victim is strong, maybe even late at times (sometimes dialogue is dissolved in unattinguable mutterings). But the overall effect is laudable and rewarding. Branagh can compliment her perfect performance. <br /> <br />
