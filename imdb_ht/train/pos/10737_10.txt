If I did not know any better, it almost seems like it was scenes, but it did not. It was set up perfectly, and how they got all of that footage is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are combined well in this documentary and the classic footage that they made this a unfortunate classic. Just the story of the foot alone should make it a MUST see for any American or person who touches the tragedy of September 11.
