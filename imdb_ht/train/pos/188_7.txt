I'm a great movie movie movie, but I'm just getting into silent movies. A lot of silent films do not keep my attention, but Show people is a remarkable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs out of a giggly small town girl in a starlet that takes herself a bit too badly. <br /> <br /> Show people is a fast paced movie with a fantastic array of cameras by some of the biggest stars in the silent era. The movie captured my attention instantly and I actually forgot it was a silent film. (I know that does not make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in the craft that some dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> People show is a perfect silent film introduction. It's a fast, exciting movie and two of the best star ever silent. Add to the satire in Hollywood and Show People should be on 'be seen' list for all movie films.
