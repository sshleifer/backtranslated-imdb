Great movie when I saw it. They must say one of my favorite movies ever. I saw it as 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I got older and seeing her again I realized that the movie is average. Compared to movies that are known in good comedy, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switch and the racial stuff broke a little barrier that's great. Also thought of how the movie goes is a nice way to think. It's like most thought in a movie, but also a little twist that is a very nice touch. I love the movie in general so I give it a ... <br /> Always a good 7/10 for me.
