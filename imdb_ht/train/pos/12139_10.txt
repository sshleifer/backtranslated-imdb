This movie, though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving, strong movie. Bette Davis, as slutty, vicious Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely credible. Watching performance is still spellable. It makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance is as weak, obsessed with Phillip Carey's is not as strong, but I do not see how any actor can keep their own against Ms. Davis's performance. It melts up the scenery at every stage it is in, totally stealing the show. This is the film that seals limbs and it deserves to win the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocking for that day what is the term pregnancy pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred's vicious tongue for it is a bit dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scenes where Mildred tells Phillip what he really thinks about it ("You squad, your pig ....") is still some of the biggest act I've ever seen on the movie.
