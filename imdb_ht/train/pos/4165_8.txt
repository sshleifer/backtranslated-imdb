No, this awful awesome 70-made-for-television clinker horror is not about a decent deadly dessert that took dessert. Still, this exceptionally horrible, yet lovable lovers lovers lovely and so enjoyable refuses to reach an enchanting Apex in absolute, engritting serenity and atrocity that's quite tasty in such a sort-out-to-be-outright-awesome way . Richard Crenna, who is joking and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if he has never received the brutal riots endured in the Jackson County Jail, sluggish shows a disgustingly beautiful and respectable suburbanite that has picturesque, mat, sleeping small town exits gets torn out when the beautiful German Shepard is taken off as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal devil. Pretty soon mimieux and its two children cutesy remix Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the passionate foreign migrants from Disney's "Witch Mountain" photos) are worshiping a red pencil drawing of nasty, ugly canine entities in the hole. Boy, now does not sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this ridiculous ridicule is ridiculous if not, but it's sure it's funny, thanks to Curtis ("night night") the horrifically poor Harrington's direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, a great deal of suffering risky'n'ridiculous plot, with a thrilling game that struggles with the absurd story (besides driving them, Martine Martinez and RG Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory have a nice comedy as a native American shaman). Favorite scene: The bad Mephestophelion Master puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a spinning oil price spinning. While stoke-up snobby film film fans can keep their nose in the perfectly quiet stench of this smalt admittedly smack, devout TV garbage lovers should consider this luxurious abominable ekabolik tube equivalent to Alpo.
