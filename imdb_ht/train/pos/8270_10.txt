This is an extraordinary movie, that your tricks constantly. It seems to be heading toward clich√© at several points, and then something amazing will happen that really escarpment. It would give away too much to say more, but stick with this movie, and you'll be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - it is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Picknick's Haines chest peaks (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtlely subtlely with great emotional emotions, so that there are very few moments. And I never thought I could get that involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Beautifully silent classic - a great example of Twenties Commercial Cinema and Corner.
