SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> I just looked at the extended version of Bedknobs and broomsticks. Even though I did as the extended version, I hope they would leave the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello Road could be cut down to the original length. It was too long and dragged the movie together. Though the dance is great, it would be best left on the DVD as a deleted scene. <br /> In all this is a great movie. My 5 year old loved it. And it's wonderful that movies that I liked as a child have spent on a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> As I got to remember! <br /> <br /> *** from **** <br /> <br />
