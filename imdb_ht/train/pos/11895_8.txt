Leoni Leoni has played Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who will be through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but comes at a price. He wants legitimate photography, but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi. Her boss is played by Wonderland and the Wonderland Taylor Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. The Nora Tea began to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just did not support comedy and still does not. Even when they were brought to George Wendt from Cheers, they made necessary changes to the casting and character. The show was good at the beginning and the audience got used to it, but then the botch network came up as a bad plastic surgery.
