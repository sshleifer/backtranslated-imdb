No premium show can please the people. Clearly if your favorite movie did not win, you will tell the show was not very good. This is understandable. However, the 74th Annual Awards will be remembered for one magic moment in Hollywood history: Woody Allen's first appearance ever at the Academy Awards. <Brr /> <br /> Allen has often shunned their premiums as being top-aggrandizing and pointless, and never went on - even though he had several of the coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Award was held, the nation was still suffering from the loss of life at World Trade Centers in New York. When it comes time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of major movie times forming city cities. Then the announcer simply said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar award winning win Woody Allen director." Where they explode in a very long standing ovation. The entertainment industry has finally received their applause to the man from New York that usually avoids the Hollywood scene. As the applause died, Woody applied some of his legendary legend to the situation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Thank you so much - that makes up for the field search." I thought they wanted the Oscars back, "it's joking." I panicked because the pawn shop was from business to age and I had no way to retrieve anything. "But that did not read. I could not work it out because my movie was not nominated for anything this year .. then , he hit me - maybe they were called to apologize. "Allen also disclosed why he neglected his entire life Oscar-embarrassment for one special night. /> <br /> "For New York City, I would do nothing." So I got my TUX over and down here, "said Allen. <br /> "It's a big, big movie town. It's a great, moving, and fun movie theater and it's a big city."
