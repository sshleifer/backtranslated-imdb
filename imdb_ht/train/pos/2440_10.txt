OH WOW. I saw this movie in Ireland's International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were in attendance and were available for subsequent questions. WHAT A Gorgeous Movie! Although putting in Ireland amid Catholic antagonism / Protestant, the story could happen anywhere between any group of people who hate each other. The horror of how quickly people can get carried away by giving a chance to prevent their hatred and anger being woven very well with a love story moving drizzled with humor and pleasure. If this one does not get caught up in the USA, it would really be more unfortunate. <br /> As for stars and players to support ... FIRST RATE. The name of Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. It is my opinion that it is better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl American Brady American! And, solid and powerful presentation by Liam Cunningham in a simple and private man in a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
