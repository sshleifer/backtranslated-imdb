This is one of five animated Disney animated animations, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length film animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), with inexpensive depth through the multi-jet cameras returning to the movie in any other way. Although Disney fits the story somewhat liberally, you pick up the idea of ​​the era through the dress and wear stylizations --- a long period of clear history takes place. Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, with a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all the characters somewhat well developed, except for the Prince - leave the most flat - we know it has a sense of humor, with a big smile, but that's about everyone. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent impact on the history of popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the attractive stepisters, just not as beautiful as Cinderella, and the characters take away otherwise beautiful appearance. > <br /> Favorite Disney adds: the mice! Also, appreciate the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoes in the movie. In addition to the homemade gown as well as this attack from the stepisters was always awful as a child - I remember seeing this show with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken shoe shows the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to keep her caught on Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley would go on to characterize the most cruel of all Disney bands, Satanic Maleficent witch, to Sleep Beauty.
