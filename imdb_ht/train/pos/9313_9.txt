I liked this show a lot - we got the first and only, it would appear, the UK series on channel 4. The characterization was good about the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different aspects of The urban population represented no laughing streak - I did not see this on an American television comedy at the time except for Larry Sanders and he really worked well here, clinging to the suggestion that cops mentioned really like this, and it's not just hamming it up for the cameras. <br /> In all, a little original chic number I just right: I can not help but think that maybe it missed it in certain brands and audiences. I think it would be a hit hit in the UK has it been shown in an acceptable hour. <br /> I'll round this off with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get caught up with this look again? Any ideas?
