I was hooked from beginning to end. Huge horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that are created by making you jump, but making you go "What are the f * ck I've just seen?" All the other commentaries gave short summaries of what the film is about, so I will not rehash what has already been said. I told others about those movie days after I saw it just because it always haunted me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I'm a true horror fan, not easy spooked by dropping like the "Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me the bad dreams was the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I was in this cell with these guys. What would my personal horror be? my subconscious had taken me there, and it was not nice. That's my friend is that a terrible cops do you! The best part of this film is that it is subtle. It's not about Bogeymen who jumps out of you, alien invasion, or tons of gore. It's the opposite. Your horrors create in your own self. The irony for the four characters is that the horror does not come out of an external force that pretends it power over them. Simply, the guys ask for something they want, and they find it ... but not the way they imagine. So, on the one hand, they get what they want to get from an owl book, but they can finally want they were not. Sometimes being locked in a prison cell is the best place to be!
