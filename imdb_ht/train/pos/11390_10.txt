The story and music (George Gershwin!) Are beautiful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch, and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and this is a good leader. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron harassed me. Anyway, despite it, the draw moves along nicely with the famous ballet (and worthy). Oh the colors, the reds are dazzling, blues, green, and yellow. Musn't forget the beards too. ; ) I just adore the contrast between the Ballet Arts Ball (completely black and white suit) and the ever-brilliant Ballet .. So I suppose what I'm trying to say is this: Please Not All means to see it, and enjoy it, because if it is not the best, it is plentiful. But make sure you do not forget that other genius Kelly music and the 20 year old girl who catapulted to starred just afterwards.
