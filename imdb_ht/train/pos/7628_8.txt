This movie is one of those "WOW!" cinema. Not because it's the greatest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was about Elvis. I can safely say as many impersonators as there was only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel was very close to being the real thing. It was one of the biggest imitations that I ever saw. It was my belief that he really was. I learned a lot about Elvis's life in this movie. And do not belong to the TV to let you lose - it's actually a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could've been Elvis' twins :)
