When I was 17 my high school was the Bella Bye Birdie scene - which is not great surprise, since it is perfect high school supplies and reputed to be the most-performing music in the world. <br /> I was a student musician and kept strong memories of the production and his songs, as well as a lack of licenses for the movie version of Dick Van Dyke who (deliberately) touched the Elvis references and camped for a swinging 60s audience. /> So when the 1995 version began to Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was happy with what I saw. Alexander turned into an outstanding performance as Albert, a performance of strong contrasts of his best-known characters from a certain TV series. Remaining cast is fun and convincing of their role (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a schoolgirl and innocent schoolgirl). But best of all, the music numbers are familiar from the stage show all preserved in this movie and performed as music music songs should (allow for the absence of a stage). So, if you know the music (and some do not), then check out this telemovie. He makes the scene show justice in a way that can probably not be improved, which is good enough for me. What better than rendering a faithful and color writer and style work?
