Two years ago I watched the "Matador" in the movie and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally under the impression of Pierce Brosan's many roles. Yesterday, I kept this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now I can say and certain that this movie is not special but you just have to "love it because of one person. <br /> <br /> Brosnan lifts class up in my opinion and amazing performance of Julian Noble, tired hit-people with no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, who got bad luck: her son was killed in accident, his job will not be well and he is not sure he can hold his wife Bean (Hope Davis) . br> <br /> I still love movies like this; movie crime and many touches of humor. Mostly this humor comes from Brosnan as it says jokes about the big nose and d .... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, following the southerly . " Brosnan says with his charm while drinking his margarita as usually. I also like Greg 'the typical American figure' Kinnear in the role of the lives that are very alive because many people like Danny Wright. So I recommend you to look good probably the best role of Brosnan ever. It will make you smile and admire her at the same time. The Great Brosnan is not equally large.
