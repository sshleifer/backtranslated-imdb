This is ever-favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. Dialogue between the two is so nice and funny and very smart. Not to mention this movie has some of the best songs recorded by the two; as I put all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire so I suppose because of that he still holds a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr * p but i'm so women getting on it) throughout this movie gets an 8/10 from me. The choreography was superb and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it making it even more scary.
