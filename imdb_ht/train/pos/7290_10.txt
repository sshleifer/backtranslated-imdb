After several great evaluations at the SUPERB point, I was very pleased with the movie. The film was dark, moving, the anger, pain, guilt and a very convincing spirit. <br /> I started to expect to see many special effects, and like a lover's caress, she blows me away with the subtlety and the aptness of her. Brian, I'm still blowing with your artistry and telling the story with your care of special effects. You will go a long way, my friends. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez looks like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, acting, story lines, high quality films and awesome effect, it was fantastic. I just want it was longer. I'm looking forward to the Dreamless with very high expectations.
