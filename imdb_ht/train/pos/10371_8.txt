This is a highly-powerful story-based story-telling story that can be up to date. I say that because a brutal hounding rabbit can give people, in this case an innocent Australian couple packed and killing their babies. Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this movie came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was little harder for Streep because he had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it well I was having trouble understanding it in part.) <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, all I can say is that this movie will put you out emotionally.
