"Too desu ka" is the first film of color of Master Akira Kurosawa, and amazing is not about samurai, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is inside a very poor community of a slum in Tokyo, where the inhabitants are homeless drunken, beggar, tramp, women abusers, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chooses this tragic term and setting for color, but indeed very sad story, some of them heart-breaking. I personally love the touching story of the boy and his father who dreams of a home of their own and built by them; The story of the late boy who believes he pilots a train; The story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own son and daughter; and the story of the girl abused by her stepmother. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden from Life" ("Way of Life")
