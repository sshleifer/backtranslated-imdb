I think I usually approach film festival comedy with the low expectation that they will invariably be "original," and that any humor is intended to be derived only from the expense of simplicity of the characters in the face of a complicated context. What was outstanding on Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his character in his film while still finding laugh-out-humorous humor in stage scenes. There was something complicated, perhaps due to the sharp part of the work of the DP, I was rarely seen in an independent film, and even more rarely in a comedy. In special note here: Turn Brewster's Paget as the math teacher Amy. After seeing this performance I can not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a major audience. It brings the necessary blend of anger and loyalty to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. This is a terrific job worthy of a major audience. I look forward to more from the director and this cast!
