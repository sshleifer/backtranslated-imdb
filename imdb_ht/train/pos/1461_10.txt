The film exposed the blatant OS of Chinese workers - generally female - garnering footage of Chinese business owners who shared his unashamed and delusional views, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressive workers who gave a voice, and, of course, the drunken Americans wearing the pearl necklaces are celebrated in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The hope of coming comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people who make bearded collars got paid as $ 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working at the bead factory, but they will probably do so when they get fed up with the popular punishment treatment and the factory owner and / or they just get too exhausted to work at 20 hours a day of hard work. I was surprised that these colliers came from, not realizing how completely fatigued and hard to do. I just really appreciated this movie as it very well shows the impact the American Indulgence has over something we consider relatively innate in our society over people on the other side of the world. Honorably mentioned Wal-Mart. It's simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
