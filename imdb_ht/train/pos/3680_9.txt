Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a movie made up of 18 segments. You can make the 18th mathematical segment in 120 minutes to say each director has seven minutes telling him or her story. The movie is based on the quotation that you can, indeed, tell a story of how much money is short. The main job. Almost all of the segments are powerful, complete, and satisfied. Each featured a different aspect of experience in Paris, and almost every director draws outstanding performances from a large and pre-large cast of actors. <br /> <br /> There were many powerful portraits in this movie that it is difficult to choose one or two favorites. Probably most memorable to me was Juliette Binoche as a mother in the segment "Place des Victoires," Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty of Latin "neighborhood," Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the "Loin du 16" segment and Margo Martindale as a Colorado mailman who learned French to go to Paris ("14th Arrest" segment). <br /> <br /> Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the boy meant little to harass an American tourist at a Paris Metro Station (Tuileries segment). an outstanding movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely miss. However, Paris is so beautiful picture that I would suggest that you try to view it on a big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
