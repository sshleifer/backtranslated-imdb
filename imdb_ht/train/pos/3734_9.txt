The disarming effect of war is a very-studied subject to the films; as is equally disuniting, but potentially life-saving, cow effecting the military training. Tigerland 'Joel Schumacher follows the standard model, we see men treated as dusty, but emerging as soldiers, with a mutual respect degree for its commander officers, and judgments that are reserved whether such an extreme process may be considered justified; as is the judgment of the merits of the war for which they were trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, does not center its accounts on a cocky crash called Bozz (played exceptionally well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power is finally ruled by consent, and the lack of consciousness among without the force of their own complexity. Around this character, a taught, interesting plot was built, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', in not just another movie of a kind which seems to lose focus once the action moves in Asia). Although not a movie of staggering originality, it's pretty well done and captivating the whole look: the best movie of this director I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.
