The best movie in Modesty Blaise I've seen too far. It's like a good pilot for a TV set. I even think it's a little "cult", as with a touch of spell of Quentin Tarantino's magic, or something. They held a great deal of modesty, but I admitted that Willy Garwin was a bit disappointed. Though I had read so many comics and books by Peter O'Donnell I'm not ashamed of this movie, quite the opposite. Positive is surprising in this story about Modesti and his childhood. I did not set my expectations so high, because of the bad movie from 1966. So I can have overrated this movie just a little bit. And if you love the comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this one! can not wait for a follow up ...
