I managed to catch this movie on one afternoon cord. I must admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, but I can sometimes get into a good sports related film. What I found more interesting was the deposition of the foster family system. As a therapist who saw both the good and the bad in the community mental health system, I though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from relatives In family, biological parents do not always take an active involvement, and transition may be heart-wrenching and heart-melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are anchor of this film, and both carry extremely credible performance. Perhaps it was just my emotional state, but I did find myself shedding a water at the end of the movie.
