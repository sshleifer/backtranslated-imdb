I know sometimes really really corny ... But the act is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is as beautiful as a button. I love this show very much, and I'm almost embarrassed that I do the b / c show to have a rep. for being really corny, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be very low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it ... Like Sabrina's father are 2 different guys throughout the movie movie ... I mean, could not are they just saying it was an uncle or something? Still, I can not help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for some light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... a HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season trials ... Once you get to college, Morgan joins the band and its dialogue is painful and very wrong to act ... Plus It's ugly, so the jokes about how it is just the survival of looks good he has lost on me ... but I think he has set up to have a really good eighth season and I'm really sad to see one in my favorite show off!
