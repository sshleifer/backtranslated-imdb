I loved this movie all my life. It's like a smart story too, with many classic aliases. example. The ship was missing the earliest decades ago called the Bellerophon. Well, in this classic mythology, the man who killed the Chimer, a legendary beast composed of two or more other animals. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera - himself and her id id. I love movies where writers have clearly credited their audience with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modbusters who spend $ 150m on special effects, but about $ 1.50 on a scenario. <br /> /> Cheers
