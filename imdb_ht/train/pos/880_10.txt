Probably the best movie of the year for me. This small French movie center has put on the office of secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spent his day doing work other people, accredited, and being the source of ridicule and conversation with everyone who is all too clear to him , being partially deaf and read. A shift in movement when it has recently been paroled by Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant. Relationships between them are the movie center. Mutual dependence, for different vast reasons, their obligations. Carla gets attracted to Paul and the fact that he makes him feel attractive for what seems like the first time. Paul does not do anything to escape because he needs his help. He must have money at a local gangster and form a stolen plan in his hand that will involve Carlas' skills in reading his mouth. I think the main thing that pushes the way the film above an average suspension / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I can not remember when I witnessed these sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuelle Devos gave a brilliant performance (she was the French Cesar for the best actress). You never feel like watching a piece of act, this really is Carla. The Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. It makes a character a bit unappealing both appealing and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and both times when I was watching her I wanted to go back to the movie and become involved with them all over again.
