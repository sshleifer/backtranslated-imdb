This is a great documentary film. Any car racing fans should possess a copy of this exceptional movie. Director Stephen Low has done a great job, as well as the main stars in the movie, Papa & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks like amazing sound. And best of all it's IMAX! Great home theater disc discs.
