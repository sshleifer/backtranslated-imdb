For a low budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors have been convinced. Eva Longoria, who now stars on the TV show "Dragnet," is sexier than ever. Where it was ideal for the gnome scheme, and the director showed his talent when it took many roles for his project. Of course this low budget film can use better transition correction and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this movie has its share of issues, such as continuity, I must say that I would rent the next director's movie. If you are a movie student, you might learn a few things from the next director.
