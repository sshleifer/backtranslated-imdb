It is a shame he did not get credit screens, he by far did the best job in the movie having the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie .It has been much more impact than April, or just on anyone else in the movie. She almost made S / M look like fun! It really was credible to have the S / M model that gets scary in his situation. Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of feeling the human being looking for the bad guy, those who were lying were pretty well built but they just sort of skim the surface of what was shot. This is one movie being both cuttings should be made available. It seems they left a lot of what was shot, and almost everything was really dark that would have made the movie much more deadly. Its kind as they stopped short of the brand they went for while filming. What injections would have not gotten a rating R probably an NC-17 or X, but this is what it would need to make the movie the way it should have been.
