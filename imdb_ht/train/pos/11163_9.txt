I like this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master in the Cinemas form, his movie was sometimes in my opinion, neglected. But this movie is a favorite to me because it really gives you the feeling of the time the movie was put in. All the wonderful characters that existed, the shape, fashion of clothing, the way they talked, OK would be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there was occasion when the two men tried to pass each other with crazy stunts . <br /> I just felt it was a bit of such story should be alleged by many people and appreciated because of this fact. <br /> Can I find it somewhere on DVD? I've only seen it on TV. But for anyone who wants a slice of movie life over this period of time is the perfect one.
