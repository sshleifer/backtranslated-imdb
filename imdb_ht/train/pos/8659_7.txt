In a way, this movie reminds me of "jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg in the shredding machine? Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? Whoopi as Lemon Blind and Imitate Mick Jagger? Great moments capture the film to make sure the movie is still kind of absorbed, right? That's how I feel about "rich in love". A man hears his wife singing for the first time. Post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from bucket and, in another scene, has a wonderful moment to wake up about her absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to her wardrobe acting. But there is only the whisper in a plot here and you can not wait to find Moving. Only when Charlotte Graff's Go-Goos' Graces revs up a great pop song to wake up ... and then it's over! <br /> This picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the South American deep.
