In my opinion this is to be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. It was the only one handful of actors, then and now who can say more and one look than an entire page in dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original movie and without precedents, and the extra 4 minutes to additional feet. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in her illegal speakeasy. He only links to anything is his good friend, Chico, played by Theresa Harris. Though Chico is African American (and has a white woman best friend and a black woman back in the 30s as controversial as the subject of this movie), and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And it's not sexual. Just 2 women stuck, or pushed, in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies, and he does not know what he's going to do, he says he has the power to get out and find what he wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point in this movie. Then "their" went and ruin the last few minutes. So, up to the last few minutes of the movie, it's a superb movie and worth watching. The "Lesson" of the movie is still as valuable today as it was back then, and I'm sure there will be a 100 years now. Female, it's terrible that Lily does in order to get what she wants, but she works. Men, take note.
