A change in outlook is neccesary enjoying British modern films, one that somehow allows them to see in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the American movie critics. Britfilm has tried hard to be bravest and finds it difficult to do it, but in British film heat may be master over otherwise overwhelming.
