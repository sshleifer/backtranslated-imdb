"A family affair" takes us back to a less complicated time in America. It's prudent to see how different everything was back then. It was the most innocent era in our country and we looked at a 'functional' family related to these things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring Hardy's family. The film, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy, with his wife Emmily, is facing a domestic crisis that must be done with them. Marrying the girl comes home after she commits a social blonde and her husband keeps her responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home a beau, who clearly explodes with her dad. Andy's happy teen, seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him Polly escort in the dance, something he is reluctant to do. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows better as he puts a plan into action so he can get everyone together again. After all, it is a person who understands, not only the law, but how to deal with those outside the threat that threatens to stand in the community and what will make his family happy. Lionel Barrymore plays hardy Judge and conviction. It is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington sees this as Emily, Mom. Mickey Rooney has a small part of this movie, but it is as always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as their daughter, Marion and Joan. Sarah Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the movie as Aunt Milly and Polly, the girl who surprises Andy and her beauty. <br /> <br /> "A Family Affair" is a great way to observe our past in the positive image painted by an American family.
