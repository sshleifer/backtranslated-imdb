"Something Guy" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, comedy comedy. The draw focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lay naked in her bed. Before she can know what happened, she rushes Becky out of her apartment because her fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. And as you might imagine, chaos occurs. <br /> Almost every single scene of "Something Guy" delivers loud laugh. These fussing moments from Paul's time imagine what might happen if he told Karen. Selma Blair is a really talented comedy, and the worst thing about this movie is that she goes underused. Although, it turns out to be more funny than Stiles' characters, which actually is not that interesting. Of course, not all comedians are perfect. <br /> As I said, "Something that" is not classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
