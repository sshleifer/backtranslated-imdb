OK, this movie begins as a movie forever cheese and does not get much better until almost well in the movie. The script is all 'cheese' and 'fluffy' and dropping by properly guiding for the most part. For the first half of the film the girl grotesque on my nerves. I do not think this is one of her best works to act. The only reason I bought the movie is because she was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. It is terrific but this is also not one of its best gigs to act. The story is based on true events and helps the movie. Actually, I did not even love the movie first and got lousy when I saw the hole in the balloon traveling, I mean .. let it get where it's supposed to go and be done with it! But all is forgiven by the time it reaches its destination and the story comes to a close. If that does not bring a tear in your eyes, nothing will be! It's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again.
