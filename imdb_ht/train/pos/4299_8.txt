In your video store, you might find this gem. <br /> <br /> The human condition of LA modern times. There is no exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that might happen to any group of people over time. <br /> <br /> Help you to understand the joy and despair of urban life. The cuts are upper classes. Cinema and music many follow the mood and situation. And the CAST !!! <br /> Excellent casting and excellent acting. No one is out of place or out of character. <br /> And it's not really as much a downer as you would expect. I gave it to 7 at 10. <br /> <br /> If you havent see it, do!
