Later Dudley Moore has been the most popular role in her too short career in ARTHUR 1981, a funny storytelling and vivid touch that generates warm smiles, great laughs, and an occasional water if you're in the right mood. Moore received a nomination nominally Oscar for her performances as Arthur Bach, a drunken Playboy who "race cars, plays tennis, women's haunting, but it has weekend cuts and is his own boss." Arthur is destiny 750 million dollars when he married a girl snooty society named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry) who is spoiled daughter in an infiltrated gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress / comedy actress from Queens who steals pals for his father's birthday. Light Moore up the screen in one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. As late as John Gielgud was a better Oscar sponsored support for his unprecedented turn as Arthur's articulator-tongued and best friend, Hobson, who had outraged Arthur's behavior to cover more sentimental feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as father Susan, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as grandmother Arthur. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first-time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following year. There was also a sequel to fail many years later, but this classic classic should not be missed.
