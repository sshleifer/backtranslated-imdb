While the British produced some sitcoms in hilarious and slick in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Male Badly compliance, A foot of the Grave, etc. - the 70s had real golden age. All new territories are explored, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the consciousness slowly evolving into a need for "sensitivity" that would, twenty years later, become policy maker. Trying to combat and confusion in this modern world has been subtly and non-so-subtle the themes of everything from the skittles of Monty Python's flying circus sitcom like Man on the House. (By the late 70's this "debacle" causes more meditative and annoying-sweet sitcoms like butterflies.) <br /> <br /> Man on the house is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the moment - a little genteel, cheeky, cool, intelligent, sometimes outrageous, and some well observing contemporary life. Compare it to a cynical 90s show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that they were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man on the house is one of the Great Britcoms in the 70s, right up with Good Neighbors (the good life), and about turning home from George and Mildred. Its quality is attested by the fact that - as well as Good Neighbors - its creators, writers, and many of its castles have continued to continue in British television.
