Should this be an American movie I would rate it 7: we've seen this before. Being an Argentine film, and being myself Argentina, I would like to give it a 10, since it's kind of quality I'd hoped for - rather than wait-for. Its superb quality is amazing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd World ... <br /> I can not forget the scene when Silverstein's family Díaz force confessed-you know what I mean if you saw movie. I think that is the key moment in the movie, not surprising, maybe the original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie I still try to pick up some previous information. Being a mainstream, satirical, one commercial, I press "play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, I'd say the state best of ideas to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, but it's credible in a certain way. As for me, I could not stop laughing at every single joke and book - "malo sos" ("you mean") ... put in the mouth of Díaz, the eldest one. I'm tired of watching movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he is a superb actor, but sometimes I feel his role as unjustly opaque, Luis Luque's role in this case. I'm not very fond of Argentine TV, so I have not seen much work from Luque, but it's pretty obvious that it's an excellent scene. His physical role, his stares, his mood attitude to this movie made me fall in love with his performance. I think her role should need some improvement, just let her show us how it can be great! <br /> I do not know if Szifrón is planning to make an end or not. I know he will not do it if he's following the rule that "second party is never good", so if he does, I will surely go see it. And I hope that, in the future, take into account the possibility of giving Peretti's counterparts the odds even to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performance, and lots of laughs!
