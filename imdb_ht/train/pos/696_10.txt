Surprisingly well done for an independent movie, The Insomniac's nightmare depicts a thrilling picture of what he would like to suffer from insomnia. Very well written, and directed, he creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer took in one night in the life of a ensomnac. <br /> Start Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night dragon. The lip is almost hypnotized, and in the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how a person copes with a lack of sleep, swinging on the brink of sanity and madness. <br /> With twists and turns around each corner, the Insomniac's nightmare is provocative and engaging. It comes very highly recommended.
