Just as the new BSG was not that fan of the original series waiting, Caprica could not save that fan of the new BSG they expected (for the most part). It is a very interesting, if not a bit independent show shows, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the great CGI emotions (the new) BSG, you'll be sad shame. If you love the drama, you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with. <br /> <br /> The story examines how Cylons are developing, why Adam hates them and their origins in a monotheistic society. Writers also managed to attack people who are playing God (s) and the creation or re-creation of 'human life'. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. <br /> I found it to pod along in some parts and too preachy in others, but all of it was promised. A small part of I want (or expected) might have some minor angings in the BSG (aside from the back story I mentioned), but that would probably combat the scenario too much. As with BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's too early to say. <br /> It would really be easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to previous set, but I want to give it a chance. In general, I thought it was interesting enough to let me see how the current series is before 'throwing into the towel (proverb).
