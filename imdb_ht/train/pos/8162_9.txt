As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen turned out to be a wonderful disruptive performance in the "Dentist". With her already obsessive compulsive tendency at high gear, the IRS hounding her, and a current current suspect; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing his sanity more and more every day. <br /> <br /> When the Doc really realizes that his wife will have an affair with the local pool boy, he sets off a string of events leading to torture, murder, between total destruction! "The dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relatable and hated at the same time. Though it is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy towards him. My friends ... is damn good to act. <br /> A nice cast cast in supporting round actors out this gem in a movie. Excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective rhythms will keep you entertained throughout the movie running. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
