I thought this film was very well done. When taking place in the mid 1950s, everything looks just like me. It was well-groomed and credible. I'm not usually so much for this kind of movie, because they just have no depth, but I felt this movie delved into the characters, and you might feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. It took me back to my youth and left me reminiscent of a most innocent time. This film can be enjoyed by both boys and girls and by all ages. After the movie was over I wanted to have a party. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and his family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you have not seen it you should try to catch it when it's on TV or rent it ...
