Stories of a B-17 pilot. Brady is shooting down on occupied territories. Local ranchers extend his kindness and protection to the price of their own lives. I have never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours. After the film is over, I'm glad I took the time. It's a whole story told to explain the look of Brady's face at the start of the movie.
