This is a true "80's movie": Back then they could have done 100 times more movies than nowadays, and many of them are quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that does not exist yet. Nowadays maybe the same kind of people would make cheap "straight-to-video" movies in the eighties, doing good porn. Porn looks to sell. Anyway, this is the highest level of garbage-film medium: It has good & fascinating story, and it's quite good to think. In one scene you can even see the microphone balance on the upper edge of the picture. Of course, there are also small gastos by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they are not very much contributing to the film "Success", although they are good in their small role. The monster, heavy-singer "Sammi Curr", looks really awful, especially when he sings. One of the horrible monsters I've seen in terrible cops. I can have nightmares in her next night. Not recommended for intellectual film lovers.
