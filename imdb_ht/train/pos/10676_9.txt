This film was shot aside at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's response to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The movie stops the test in quite well, and all the moral stories still (or even more) are relevant today. The film features some fine performances from some British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool cop who is assigned to juvenile bonding duty, and quotes that if you catch the kids at an early age, they will end up being adult responsible. <br /> <br /> The remarkable cameos of the movie include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play siblings (their real brothers and sisters) are kept in an arsonist web. Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film 'Performer'. <br /> <br /> Violent playground features a gun siege at a school, so it is easy to be shown on television following similar events in Scotland / Russia. I lived in Gerard Gardens where the film was shot (though not born at the time), and have memories of the area. I recently finished a documentary about Gerard Gardens including extract from 'Violent Playground', with a UK 'Coast Coast Coast movie that stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The songs were demolished in 1987 and the films are going to keep the memory alive. There were some complaints of residents when the movie was released, as the movie showed the area of ​​a bad light. Time has helped to cure these injuries. <br /> <br /> A little bit of a movie, I would recommend you seek this out
