I enjoy Ralph Bakshi film ("Wizards", "Cool World" and animated "Lord of the Rings") and I am a Frank Frazetta collector and fan. I am also a fan and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> I miss the "Fire and Ice" released theater back in 1983 and looked forward to seeing it on video or some renaissance ever since. Therefore, released in 2005 was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some trampings, because I was hoping it would not only be worth seeing once, and put on the shelf as a collection collection dust collection "until day I died. Fortunately, my fears were illegitimate and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie. <br /> Like Frazetta's art this is a fearless film that has a physical and sexuality that is difficult to get into most fantasy / sword and sorsyery films without cheesy or dirty. The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at her best. Even young boys I love watching her with me and asking them to look at her again and again. However, my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess (many Frazetta-enquire). I do not mind that because it is credible and there is no sex scene. <br /> There are roto-skoping used, but personally I like roto-skoping. It provides more fluid and realistic movements of the hard characters found in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuous issues, I recommend this movie to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, and Swords and sorsyery fans. Enjoy!
