This film was made by one of the most absurd humor in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he had a romantic comedy, but knowing that he was a heavy cinephile, seen at every local festival and in the local cinematic, I had a positive sentiment on this movie. Hell, I was good. Straight on the stick, the scenario (written by Pelletier itself) is a bit twisted and hard to follow, but in Pelletier's mode it's a 90-minute-a-a-a-kind jack-in-the-box -. <br /> Loosely inspired and mostly transformed harmful harmonics of Liaisons (by Laclos) "The Aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge. Throughout the movie you will find the occasion to find out who and who's writing in who's frid goddam .... who pops up in an interesting love affair. <br /> <br /> Great scenario, great photography, great quotes in other cinemas. Should we ask more for a first movie?
