The ship can sink, but the film was not !!! Director, James Cameron, from the 'Terminator' has done it with this amazing photo. One of my favorite scenes is the Dinner Table scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'One' ... I hope I have that look when I'm in the bedroom with my future husband. Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mother and all her elves stuck up partners who live in their husbands' wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the star of Grape Gilbert delivers it. I really loved the hanging on the boat scene. It was a good risk. The movie is long but it's fantastic !!! Good story, good sound, good actor !!! Go see it twice if you want it, it's worth it !!!
