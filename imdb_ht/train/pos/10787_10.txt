So, when I was little I got this movie as a present with my sister and I loved it. we would look it all the time. when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we would look great rock candy mountains and their magic dad's games. I'm 21 now and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently got together and watch it, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little . A friend actually bought this movie with the dad's magic game for her two-year-old daughter because she wants to spend on our love in this movie. This is really a movie you can let your kids look and feel safe, not violence, no bad language, just lots of great songs and important lessons.
