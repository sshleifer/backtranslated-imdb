This movie exceeds my expectations. I thought and heard that he was going to waste, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not take well to lead the girl and did not really care if she lived or died. After a while it definitely grew on me and became a likable character. It's not just some slasher movie where dead for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds into the movie, but explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure just to look it anyway, it's only an hour and a half in your life. You will live for 80 years anyway.
