This 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 film of the same name turned the heat early, and did not let us come for the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not keep his eyes on the beautiful girl (played by Dutch Fenom Maruschka Detmers) who lives next door to the school. One day she followed her, and her pay was paid. There are only one problem: It's engaged in an excused character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) that may or may not commit a crime crime, and if he repents, they will probably leave off with a slap on the wrist. Also, the woman is a little "funny at the top," and this is koroborated when we discover she saw the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is only equal to her sexual prodigies. Hot, hot, hot, from the word goes, with nice driving with a bomb performance in Detmers, which plays us as a Yo-Yo (as it does the boy) from the scene scene, with enough hold holds we guess right up until - and even after the end. Available in R and X (!) Rated versions.
