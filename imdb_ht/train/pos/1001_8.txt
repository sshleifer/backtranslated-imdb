A little funny and well-paced comedy action Jamie Foxx as a hapless, quick-talking hoodlum who is chosen by a trojan Trojan Agent Treasury (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to get a reliable computer steal / Hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars in the treasury and two guardians dead. <br /> <br /> "Bait" marks the sophomore brand for Antoine Fuqua ("The Killers Replacement") and it manages the work properly even though it does not head his first movie. What two of these movies have in common is the sequence actions, which are flat-out excellent. Foxx is very good here although his character is annoying from the beginning, but in the movie I started to catch on. Hutchinson is wonderful as the mastermind who can be gracious as John Malkovich and patient as late as Laurence Olivier was at "Marathon Man". Morse is okay as the agent comes with the inventive smart plan to find people who did it at all cost.
