There are too many ways to avoid cinema and eating disorders is one of them. This movie shows it as it is. It is not glamourised for viewers to enjoy, it shows real truth that makes it all the more powerful. I only saw it once and that was a few years ago but I can always remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful movie and a good support for anyone suffering from a food illness given to the volunteer to stop. This is what the movies should be over-should be to help people and not glamorous things are wrong.
