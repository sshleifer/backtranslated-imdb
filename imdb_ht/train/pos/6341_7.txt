Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey at last performance "performance" ("The Truman Show," "Man on the Moon"), I still thought his real lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic actor, talent: these boso at the Academy Awards seem to love him so much, he never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any "institution" nominated for 11 oscars such a "Titanic" firm should not be taken seriously. <br /> On and review. The "Grinch" is sweetest, best looking, best acting, seasonal epic film since the "Nightmare Before Christmas". Both movies look very similar, too, and very stylishly styled along with citing someone stolen Christmas. Both acting principals seem like the bandits (one to one degree higher than the other), both packed a moral moral lesson, and both are really enjoyable. <br /> That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and the Grinch is a person. But someone who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so real, that never gets in the way of the movie. It can be hilarious, it can be a sad soul, it can be upset. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, laughs, weeps, and finally saves Christmas. I liked this movie in bits, and can not wait to read it out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.
