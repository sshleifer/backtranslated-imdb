I saw this 25 years ago on PBS. It was very hard to look. So real. To watch this small family fight in the winter was heart rate. There is no time for courting: the fate we have thrown together and put our shoulders in the grindstone and make it work. This is based on the current newspaper of the woman, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents had died when she was little and all the bitter and the sisters had to work hard to feed themselves. She learned Mow, who was not lady-loving. He was afraid that no chief ruler would want a woman who has sun-brown, but expansive, but her husband was so happy that her new wife knew how Mow, and she was happy to do it. Both were widows and they worked to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if it was read today, I'm sure it would be good. That only makes sad tragedies. I cried so hard. But then they came out successfully pulling out a new bull. Spring is on its way, and life goes on. In her diary, she had two more boys and lived.
