I'm going to do this short and sweet because I do not think there are so many you can really tell someone about this show that has never seen it other than hilariously funny and unique, so I can possibly have fun in the show. <br /> You have to really watch it to understand its humor and it took me a few episodes to really get in it, but once you's no getting back out. For example the idiocy way character always wants to see her friends get into some sort of problem and it gets the funnier it gets. <br /> <br /> Every classic round I mean the cast, the writer, the director, it's just a recipe for success. An actor I think is constantly becoming a tough time is Ashton Kutcher but I mean it's great at this show I do not think it's possible for Kelso's characters to be played by anyone else, taking a very smart person play someone who is stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be worth while while reviewing if I did not mention Mila Kunis's cold fox, now thats a spicy meets a bullet all the sports on the spot where amazing shows.
