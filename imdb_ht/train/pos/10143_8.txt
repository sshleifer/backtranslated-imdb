This was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons. Allow peace right for a change, and a story that is way way higher than the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car accident, in which he drives. His airbag worked, it's not. It is burning beyond recognition (big grocery supermarket), and does not give much to a chance to live without a full skin transplant. But even in a coma, he kept dying, but he was brought back by modern technology, and when he died for a few minutes, his ghost appeared to be a very revered spirit. Carnage in course progress, and also some very gory killings, and also, some very sexy scenes. What more can you ask, could you ask? Well, not so much, because this baby has it all, with a very satirical ending, which should leave a smile on most viewers facing. I just liked Rob Schmidt's (Wrong turn) direction too, having a great spell for horror. Excellent episode, this is one I buy for sure.
