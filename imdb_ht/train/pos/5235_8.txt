The plot does not begin to describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather, * this movie *. It's totally referential to the point that you think it will fold in on itself as a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and writes about it. It's very philosophical, such as "Waking Life" but more Zen orientation and for that matter, better, in my opinion. At one point there are people-on-the-street interviews and then you see the shots of those people being filmed, and then you discover that the answers are scripted when someone keeps launching his line. There are beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD so I can watch it again more carefully. View from Cinequest (San Jose, CA movie festival) on 2/25/2002.
