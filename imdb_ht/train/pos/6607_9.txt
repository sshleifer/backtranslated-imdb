I would almost give it 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as the missing-leading sedentary flow / continuity of the movie. The storyline is great and well composed; you will definitely want to watch this slowly understand all of it. Characters are complicated and so the story line, expect to be provided only enough information to stop scratching yourself, it's a movie where all explains in the end. The animation is great with the combination of femme fatal and noir film resulting in a big movie that is unlike anything else I've seen in anime. It's a black and white black and black silk film in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good T.V, or plasma. The character voice saved this movie in its English version, but it would be more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that Paris is happening, I enjoyed reading more in French with English subtitles. One of its assets is well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally if you enjoyed this movie you might also like; Waking Life & Ghost in an innocent 2 Shell, this is just a personal suggestion.
