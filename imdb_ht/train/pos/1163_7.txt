This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work with. Although, some viewers may lack the intricacies of this film because of the very typical "obsessed killer" type of marketing approach, there are different differences on this movie. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, as played by the obvious talent Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these movies are precisely because the violence may seem random, but here's the division of past abuse (dealing with a realistic but tastiary) way of formulating the psychosis in AMANDA. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems himself to the end with an act of love, where most of these movies turn into the typical, all fights from the death and the evil character die as wrong at the end as they start with them. <br /> There are some rough edges in this picture, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its reflection and yes, originality as compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
