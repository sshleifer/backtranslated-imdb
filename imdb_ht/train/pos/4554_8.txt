There are not many fascinating-chances-stories as well as those of Christy Brown. He was born with cerebral palsy in 1930, Dublin, his parents thought his disability was mental as well as physical. Though eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower-class working class with almost 20 children, pushed her to just be appreciated by her family. Through the use of his only fully-functional salt, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both his skills developed expert. <br /> But what does the movie version of the brown "Foot Left My" autobiography movie as a great reference is its humility. Both Jim Sheridan's directors / writers and Daniel Day-Lewis stars have managed to tell this story in a way that does not appeal to attention and melodrama resort. Lit cheese and frustration scenes as well as the glorious moments of minute victories are easy inconveniences in such a miraculous story, but "My Left Foot" remains real and intrinsic inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to emphasize. Playing anyone who has problems such as serious physics has to be a quest quest. Not only Day Lewis gives us a very complete picture of Christy, but it also manages the chronic growth, improvement and interior change of the character at different stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he has limited language skills and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he did Christy intelligently to learn who fought to cope with why he can not find love non-platonic. The latter theme is most of the movie and it would have been wonderful for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton really the body out. Regardless, Jou Lewis gets us understood and sympathized with all these elements, giving a performance that's so credible you often do not have time to think "wow, it's like a great actor." These are the most commendable performances. <br /> <br /> Similarly important but in more subtle means Sheridan's work is on the movie. This story is about life-to-day life and struggle. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances to intrude his life, his struggle does not unlike our own and Sheridan extends this concept completely. Christy is struggling with love, parenting, self-esteem and abilities. Its writings are just more physically manifest (literally and figuratively) than us. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us the moment that captures the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. The drama evolves naturally when the tensions are high and the humor comes in much the same way. The scene of dinner when Christy learns that her doctor / teacher - the woman she loves - who is going to marry her brother's brother is the finest film example of both Day-Lewis and Sheridan efforts. It was built up to Sheridan that it comes out when we are ready with Day Lewis to take you out of there with his stunning work. Other strong elements in the movie are Brenda Fricker as Mrs Brown. I did not know she would have the Oscar, but there was something about her performance as the love and wisdom of Christy Mom who just called Oscar-worthy. Loving her for Christy and constant struggle for her just looks so compassionate and sincere and she achieves a lot of sympathy to her situation. The <br /> <br /> The emotional punch in the movie gives the story is surprisingly minimal. Maybe that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human. The two should be reconciled but I imagine it's challenging to tell a story that feels true-to-life with one that gives dramatic enough moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice of downplay the latter was definitely one wise for my "Left Foot." Brown's circumstance speaks for themselves - they do not have to rush to dramatic dramatic impact .. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site moviemusereviews.com for more
