This movie should not be compared to the "Sting", or other movie / capit / heist / con game. What makes it such a great movie experience is what he says about relationships, deceiving and trusting. It is also a fairly critical cut in psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrinking that is so easy to deceive and then acting in a primitive way in the final. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Very, widely recommended!
