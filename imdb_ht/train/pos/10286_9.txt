This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also deeply deep and eye-opening. I'll watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is not happy with his life. He has a job with a lifetime, but he does not think it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, satisfying, and the bad idea that her life is not the way she envisions she should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce finishes losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives it the power of God. Bruce uses these powers to find what he always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned he would make it happy ..... with one exception. In the process of taking everything, she loses one person who really loves her. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needs to happen in his life has not been the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look into your life with a great respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "Since anyone knows what it takes to make them happy?" with the addition of my modest, "Let's not worry ourselves with people who have problems while we try to find out."
