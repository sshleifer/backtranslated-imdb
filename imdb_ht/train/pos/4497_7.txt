I saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in late 90's and only recently had a chance to watch all three parties across Netflix (service practices in the way). All in all, I loved this lighthearted, sometimes genre challenged, mini series. The story of a smaller man falls to an older woman seems to work with the actors indeed. Yes, it has some romance clerks to run in the rain or bid a train station, but the characters have a chance to explore so it does not seem cheesy, as it would if this was some Tom Hanks car or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a separate Scott-Trenul doing a great job of someone who is heading on the heels of love and the ebb and binds of desire and rejection to launch the range of prices ticket listable. Personally, I think the series could be done with two episodes, but that's up for debate I suppose. Apparently, there is an end, and that should happen tomorrow via Netflix.
