I saw first Enchanted April about five years ago. I liked it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for April, leaving their humdrum live behind them. They are very sad women at the start of the movie, and you can not help but their roots on how to plan this get away with the other two women invited together to share their expenses. This is perhaps the most pleasant movie I've ever seen. It's pure and simple, with no car chases, no animosity and no death. It was made with care and taste very good. You can not help but smile all through it - except when you cry tears of joy!
