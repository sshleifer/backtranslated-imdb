This is a very nice and almost mediocre movie-there is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the landscape and music compliment each other perfectly. I did not first connect the red hair to the girl and the fox until she pointed out to me by a friend (who also had red hair!) It is almost a kind of old fashioned film in the kids , saying that the kids today prefer animations such as Shrek or Toy Story etc.-but I feel that the youth should present more of the beauty and wonder of nature that this movie certainly does. Perhaps not the best movie ever of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages - not just kids.
