In the hands of a more skilled director, this movie would be considered a horrific prank. Despite Michael's "Death Wish" winner simply directional direction, the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The bold clone more than a horror resonant on her backs (several it can not shake) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine boyfriend who actually listens to her as she stresses that the strange things they are will go down. Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her dumb and diverting lesbian lover. John Carradine performs a heck-to-a-job sitting in a chair. And watch out for a brief chat in Chris Walken's unknown-time-time! This movie is creepy and creative. Twisting them are beautiful, if a tad is predictable. The bigger point, in which I will give any details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again a better director could do more with it, however, it is quite satisfying - at least give people the sensitivity of sixty horrible. <br /> <br /> If you like modern excessive pronounced body-counting turtle-fantasy, you have not liked it. There is almost no gore. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, although some succulent makeup is near the end - most of which actually is not makeup ... but maybe I've said too much. <br /> I was rated this slightly higher than its quality can be justified, but I enjoyed it as much as any movie "8" that I saw.
