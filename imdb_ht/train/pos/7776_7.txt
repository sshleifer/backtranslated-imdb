Is anyone aware of these two sports cars? I think Robert Stack might be a character Masseratti.Rock Hudson told his father he took a job in Iraq, is not timely? I had Dorthy Malone in my bank most of my life, maybe this was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall sure had some chop in this movie and probably out-acting Malone but part of Malones made a more sensational impact so it was the Oscar for best supporting roles. Loren's cover was considered a leading role? Old man Hadley character was probably a very common picture of tycoons in his era in which he was a regular guy who made it great in an emerging industry, but in building a whole city he forgot his children for his wife to carry them .At long time, his widow realized that they all had really been and were spoiled rotten, looking for attention, so rather than trying to relate to her children she blew herself. Ancient Morality story. Seriously , what were sports cars?
