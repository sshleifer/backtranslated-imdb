Original and Barbara Stanwyk saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too nasty and the movie itself too late to be really enjoying today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, free-spirited one woman who conceives and refuses help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underrated performance). She raises her daughter Jenny playing so slowly by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and finally make a life-changing decision. Through the film, there are many laughter, tears and memorable moments especially between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-star as Jenny's would-be stepmother, which even though rich turns out to have a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movie and lots of emotions you will enjoy the Bett Midler version of STELLA.
