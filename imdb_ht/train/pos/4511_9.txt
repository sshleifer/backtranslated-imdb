I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on holiday in Norway where she was released with English subtitles. <br /> The movie is very good and powerful photo acting. The portrait 'Frits' portrait of the lead lead has an amazing face that mirrors with the painful accuracy of the tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie we see that the father who beloved Frits has mental health problems and this brought up when the brutal prince refused to attack the boy and suggested he was her own dad. <br /> <br /> The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show respect to the principal; simply stopping his ground and repeating 'lich' as ​​it is brutally attacked in front of his classmates is a scene you're not likely to forget. The only weak film films are rather shabby 'flower power' teachers who use each trick 'teacher proficient' in the book. Other than I feel that this is a movie you'll really enjoy.
