Me and my girlfriend, Annette, look at this together with us will be both comments. Both of us really enjoyed watching this even if it took some liberty and Dicken's job. A lot of Dicken's work is a bit black and sad (including Oliver Twist), but this movie is changing everything. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musical), and the characters were more hellhearted. <br /> <br /> WORK: Of course, I do not care much for music and dance movies, but the melodies in this production were enticing and alive, and the choreography was frightening. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: This really tells a lot from Travis. I can not emphasize how genuinely good the dance numbers were. You can say, for example, the boys really worked hard to get the routines down to perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVICE: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really do a good cruel. That one scene where you see her reach the post office gave me chills down the back ... AWESOME. And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect artful cake. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when he died). He can sing too! The Kudos Department filed on the choices there. I hated the kid Oliver Tho. It was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste. (I wanted Bill Sikes would drop him into mud during the chase scene.) And they should not have made him sing either. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really superb. In addition to the three Travis stars mentioned, I felt Ron Moody (Fagin) had a tremendous job. It was so funny, and at the same time lightly disaster. The supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe brought him Mr. Bumble Role very well. And she has a beautiful voice singing. I saw Mr. Secombe performing in another film called "Davy" where he plays an opera singer and pleasing results. Talent Harry Secombe should have been in a lot more movies. <br /> <br /> WORK: As I mentioned earlier the story is not true in the book, but IMO it was more robust. This movie was not boring either, as some musicians gathered. And the continuity keeps you moving right along with the characters. The tunes were not detected in the plot or put you to sleep by being too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any music movie that Travis watches has completely got to be a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It's a very easy-to-watch production that brings the viewer smooth and enjoyable to the end. In a day when movies all seem to have combined effects with beautiful figures, this was a refreshing interwoven. Our rating combined for this was 8.5 at 10. (We will round up to 9 in this case.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated this 7 especially because the Oliver wool kid (Mark L. ) irritated me, and his songs were tortured in my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is a 10th movie does not get better than that. And you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what he was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss this one ... even if you normally do not like music. It really is a rare treat.
