I and my sister used this rent whenever we had movies and parents we would get angry at that (but they left us anyway) and I loved it ... I can not find anyone close to me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who liked this movie ... I wish I could get this on DVD somewhere !! I would like to watch this now just bc I liked it very much like a kid ... and i'm 15 now !!! I remember so much about it ... that's where I got the Bunny Fufu song song from out with all my friends know this song, but not the movie !! I think the girl was there by sliding down the slide on her little playground
