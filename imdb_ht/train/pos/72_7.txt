I just recently watched this movie 1954 starring Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. The price shows Don Gallico, a magician / inventor who drives murders when the boss steals several of his magic inventions (and also his wife, described in a short role by Eva Gabor's beautiful). Even though price is a murderer, I actually find myself getting rid of it, it's a sympathetic character that is angered by the greedy people around him who keeps taking advantage of him. Although this film does not have a "movie" factor in some of its most popular roles (like my favorite, "House of Wax") it does not matter enough to keep the viewers interested in it. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent Price Fans.
