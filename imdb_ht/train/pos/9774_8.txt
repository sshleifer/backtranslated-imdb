This movie has its ups and downs, but I'm the good thing in this movie many outweigh the bads ... <br /> <br /> What's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes dialogue The sound, sound, lighting (I am the only one who has noticed how sex was lit, amateur and acting ... <br /> <br /> What is very good are the very original storyline, the very atmosphere The intense, gore factor that is very high, and the effects that make them very. <br /> So definitely worth seeing, or maybe even a must-see for all your horror and Gore fans.
