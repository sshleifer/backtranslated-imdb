In all British films are imperialists like four pens, charge of the light brigade for example, this movie means out as the cream of the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun never put on the British Empire." Get on it. I will not go into why because many others have expressed the reasons why many people make this movie great. I visited the Alabama Hills and made the passport in which the British market and remained as it was, changed by time and encroachment by people and hooligans. And even if I know he's coming, see Din lying dead on a bed and when these lines are reading <br /> "Yes, you! You! You! <br /> You Laser-leather Gunga Din ! <br /> Even if I've been belted with you and flayed you, <br /> <br /> Do not be the Gawd livin who made you, <br /> You're a better person than me, Gunga Din " <br /> I always, in 54 years of age, find noble eyed and anyone who says they are not a liar. The range of emotions in it is the mark of a big movie. Like finishing in another big movie, in Mouse and Men.
