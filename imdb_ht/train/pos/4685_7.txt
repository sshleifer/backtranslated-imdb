In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crime" (1992), Sean Young plays a courageous D.A. in Atlanta. It is a loner who gets himself too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a fashion photographer famous and seduces women, taking compromising pictures of them, then leaving them. Of course, this The hard shadow decides to enter into the mad shutterbug's life by posing as his animal, which intends to bring him to justice. They meet and make love, then the next thing she knows, she is on her lap, getting spanked. (Note: The scene is only recorded in the "unrated" version of this movie. The R-rated version is omitted with several other scenes that would make the plot more sane.) This psychological suspension includes several scenes of stripping girls with disturbing images, such as Bergin chasing one of his victims in the room, flailing into it with a rising crop. <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crime" is at its best when Sean Young is playing his cat and -mouse game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It is unfortunate that the movie does not end, it just stops. That's true. Lizzie Borden's directors can just run out of the stories saying, but after 92 minutes of credit roll, and we leave with a puzzling "what's up to now?" Conflicts in Young's plans played out of engaging style, but the lack of an individual finish will be a turn-off for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado) @ yahoo.com)
