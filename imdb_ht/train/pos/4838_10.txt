This movie reminds me that some old black and white movies are definitely worth the look. <br /> <br /> Initially I had some reservations, however from the beginning of the movie until the end I was captivated. I was very impressed with the mix of drama, suspense & comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is hilarity and has been at the point all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or over-the-counter movie "movies" of today.
