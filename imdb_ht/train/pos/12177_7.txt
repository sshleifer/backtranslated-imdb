Recap: In the morning after his bachelor party, Paul is hacked by his mother-in-law and discovering that a woman is asleep around her. Unfortunately a waitress from the bar, and not his fianc√©. And suddenly it turns everywhere ... the toll booth on the freeway and at its parent-in-law dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when he jealous of his companion was followed by photographs. It is not just about saving her marriage ... it is about to survive. <br /> <br /> Comments: Actually better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I hope, but something very funnier, something with a little corner. This film was not afraid to take the jokes a little further. With Jason Lee now how to deliver comedy, especially when her character is half-panicked and deep in trouble, as it is here. And she received nice support from beautiful lady Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a nice party as the former. <br /> So more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I loved it very much. <br /> 7/10
