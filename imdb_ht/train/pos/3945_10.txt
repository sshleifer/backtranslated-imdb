The rating is only a 5 because it's a movie that can be used best with direction (or at least music!). However, for the achievements of Walt Whitman, he deserved a 10th post before calling the film cheese, however, I think it is a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The movie makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out than having a movie featuring Hollywood shines. And for that, I applaud them - the reality it is non-mainstream reflects the life of Whitman as well. This film is much more documentary than for acting. To be fascinated with a story like this, when you rarely hear from these kinds of stories that form current mental health days, it is the most important thing. I found it a very enjoyable look at history.
