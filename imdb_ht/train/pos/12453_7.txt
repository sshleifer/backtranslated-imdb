Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb are equated to budget and bad. Whatever other movie might need, more budget really does not belong to it. Large groups and many special effects would turn it into another movie Lara Croft. What we have here is a step or two better than that. Almost Alexandra Staden's sex is fascinating as the enigmatic modesty, and this is crucial for this film at work. It's wise to smile little and know the looks are formidable, and you find yourself wanting that the camera will not leaver to his face. He made it workable that the bad guy Nikolai, playing not too little known (in the US at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau could take a serious serious interest in her, something Modesti can exploit. He is able to divert his rape with just a little push and spit out "stop wasting my time!" Then storms interrupted between his army again suddenly diffident. Make a scene as possible by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with tren-thin Staden playing Modesty is it's just not very believable to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscled guy looking like Coaster-Waldau and beat him . It's just not a Wilson Peta or a push-up actress Hilary Swank who can throw a convinced punch. Coaster-Waldau leaves himself must be overpowered by Staden seemingly roughhousing with his younger sister. Since this is not really a movie action, this is not a big mistake. I'm just hoping to do better on that if and when to make a break.
