Along with the South Pacific, guys and dolls are for grown-ups - - it's sassy, ​​sexy, and full of men's men and women being nailed together. <br /> There is a power and drive that makes this stand out of the pack - Jean Simmond's performance force, with the charm of a young Brando, and a previously masterful Sinatra adds a lot of feeling in general with the look of pieces in. <br /> <br /> Guys with dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is: a MGM music. <br /> <br /> Always look good and listen to too much tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classic 20th Century movies and must look and enjoy for years to come. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended.
