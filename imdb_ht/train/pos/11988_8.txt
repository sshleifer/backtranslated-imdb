I used to watch this show when I was a girl. When I think about it, I only remember it vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. The two things I'm vaguely reminiscent are the sequence of opening and theme songs. In addition, everyone was ideally disposed. Also, the writing was very strong. Their performance was top-grade, too. I hope some networks bring it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, though I do not think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope you catch it one day before it goes to the air for good.
