Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - It's officially Disney animated animated sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure how accurate is (i love nitpick) but it made me curious the first time i heard it described. <br /> <br /> * Preview look, for the most part, cool damn. Obviously, it was also "too screaming" according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * - It apparently did so badly that Disney said, "Screw it, let's re-drop 'Kids' Spy". <br /> So, with all that said, how is the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> I am an animated fan sucker that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" goes all out. It's a throwback of all the eye-candy CGI cats in the "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so it's almost the best of the manifestation of the host's effect. Characters maybe not memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot of a little dull, but this is not a movie you look for the plot. <br /> Conflicts that annoy me. The "Chess" (as in, it "only" took in, like, five hundred million or something; I know that animators would kill them to see fifteen dollars in this film in comparison to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." have seen this as evidence of the death of traditional animations. I do not think it's true. How do you account for the movie "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really, the story and artistry are everything, not the method. I do not know what Disney's comeback movie will be like, but I do not think they're out of the picture again.
