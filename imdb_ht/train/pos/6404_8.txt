As I watched this movie, and I started to see 'her character developed I could feel this would be an excellent picture. When you find that feeling, and the movie is full of what to expect the experience is rare. I had a lot of this feeling in this film. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Remote Junior played slingshot and amazingly strong parts that both Oscar deserved. Throwing in support was equally as strong to create a foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, watch this movie it will not disappoint.
