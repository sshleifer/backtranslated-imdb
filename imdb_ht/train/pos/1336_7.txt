This is a generally beautiful movie, with good stories, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest movie points is the bitter chain of copying sequences from Pretty Woman. Why? Is it painful to try some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya can not get pregnant after an injury during the previous pregnancy, and finally decided to use a surrogate mother, who will bring their children. Choosing Madhubala, a vulgar whore played by Preiny Zinta. The movie is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does this mean that the man has to sleep with him? Have you heard of pollination? Anyway, I guess if the writers have heard of all this, the movie would not have been done, so the concept is apparently intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman acts very well. It's good to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary dialogue with cheap over his love for his wife and how difficult he finds it to sleep with another woman. Come on, cheese and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; It is generally effective and try to do something with the role but gets completely covered by Preity Zinta. The movie belongs to Preity, who steals the show in a great way with her impeccable performance. It makes the transformation from a loud whore to a tender woman easily and naturally. She lives the movie, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, in part because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best career performance. There is no doubt he is more talented than his contemporary industry. It just should do more of these roles. <br /> The end of the movie only emphasizes what I said above. It is worn-tremendous, interesting and very well-acting. Look at Preity. <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
