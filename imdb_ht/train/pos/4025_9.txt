Superb. I began to think that being given to communist Amrita Pritam and the nationalist Dr Dwivedi's nationalist philistine will have more Frank than novel but when I read the novel I was amazed to find out that he was reversed. <br /> <br /> Kudos Marita Pritam has not been pseudo-sec and Dr. Dwivedi to be objective. This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive manner. Negotiations in any war are women as some poets have said and this film is personalized. He is also a sad next to Hindu psyche as they can not stand against the kidnappers of the girls or the Hindu Brother who can only burn the gardens of his tormentor. On the other hand it also shows economic angle behind partition or in fact why the girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think kidnappers thought that by girls kidnapping they will become legal owners of their homes and thus new Govt. Will not be able to ask them to return home. This apart one has to salute the courage of the character of Puro and Bhabhi its are two simple girls unmindful girls in the outside world and chaktihng risk does not try to return after they have been accomplished. Because there are many documented cases when these women were not accepted by their families in India. No wonder he asks a woman to understand other women's pain.
