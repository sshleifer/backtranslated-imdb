In Mexico this movie was revealed only by PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer lives, is a true example of a good German and especially about a good person. The conversation between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor is especially interesting. A true idea war ': two Germans differ, both faith and faith. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: people, freedom fighters, companions, churchgoers and a great scholar; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommend this movie very much, especially in difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we do not know much about Pastor's past and legacy life, this is a great job to save a forgotten hero.
