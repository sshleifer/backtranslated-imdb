One of the unexplored gems in the 1980's, scene ... features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker (how does he not get a ton of role after this?) And Wallace Shawn. It's a tasty throwing-up of class wars and people in these classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters, while not subtle, are nuances. And, sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a "gang") did not put in for "sociological values" as another review implies they should. The value here lies in what the movie is doing in the fun and in the brilliantly cruel way it does. I found it creative, funny, and associative.
