He may not have been attending academies and admittedly, it's very cheesy, but it's just so much fun! There's nothing to make me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic, and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to unwind. Even though I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier for me. The wolf is flippin hilarious with Bill and Ted are even more endearing. Those who give me grief about this movie's love, but only genuinely stupid movie-watchers will say it's not even a bit entertaining. If you like this, you'll probably also be a fan of Wayne's world, dude where in my car, and dumb and dumber. Admit it, even if the fools make you grin and turn your hatchet over. So watch them just for kicks and giggles !!
