Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave everyone the ability to love the whole world, but to give that a human heart is very small in size, each person has special seats that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when set out to profite the eternal love for that special place and to describe situations in the lives of people that its desires and visitors. The result is a beautiful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guide, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking tour of Parisian accommodation, human feelings, trends and expectations. /> <br /> Still some other quarters, there are still some stories that move on ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about vast array of love- love for partners, kids, parents, for those who want to tell the world for us but not around, love that needs to be reindling, serendipitous love for strangers as your eyes meet , or love that just does not mean to be ... today, but tomorrow-who knows? But this movie is not just about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and hopeful. <br /> I give this movie a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might be more developed, but not all of them and the things I get missing, and not "more development" I do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as anything else I can only say - fascinating. Make you want to leave everything behind you, run to Paris and live these little romance yourself.
