I was an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The serious beauty of the boat-breaking lake in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the enormous assembly plant in China, beleaguered the old outskirts of Shanghai that just waiting to be torn down: these captured landscapes well by the photographer and the movie. <br /> At times I was thinking about old TV documentary about abandoning coal mines and plastic-mold factories; The sort of stuff I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work has great value in showing how the industrial activity was only moved to Asia, it was not stopped. The unusual scenario for me was the scrap-to-computer computer somewhere in China - the garbage was a menacing thing, while the workers were pretty jovial.
