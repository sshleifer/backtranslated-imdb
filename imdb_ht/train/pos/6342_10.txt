In a word - excellent. This is the movie. Go and see. Ron Howard's Director ... I mean, Ron Howard's Director has done a fantastic job, as he usually does. An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, amazing variety of costumes. Wait, there is more to it than that - the story is very good, too. There is clearly a message to be extracted from it by the viewing viewers. Jim Carrey is top-notch. It is probably the best possible Grinch. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is a good thing. I'm sure he has some great avenues. The dog is cool. All in all, it's a very high-quality Christmas fairy-tale. If you love fairy-tale, it's for you. If you love Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read some other comments here ... Find a Life. It hurts every time they see people out there ... well ... got the hearts of too little size.
