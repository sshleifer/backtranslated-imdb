Santropa has many in common with the Third Man, another noir movie that's like among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM, there are many camera labs invented. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman she does not really understand, and having naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives. <br /> But I should say that Third Man has a better crafted storyline. Santropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it too coherent to spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is unrelentingly gloomy - "noir" of more than one essence; one never sees the sun shining. Grimas, but intriguing, and scary.
