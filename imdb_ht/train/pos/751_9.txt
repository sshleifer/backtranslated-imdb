This is one of the best films Jodie Foster out and is largely ignored with the general public misconception of her as a teenage cock. She had nice performances, particularly a battle scene between Jodie and her mother, played by a convinced Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateur but I think it's worth seeing.
