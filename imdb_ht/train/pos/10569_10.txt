Clever, fearless, witty, fast-paced, sexy, morning, smile, erotic, sincere and unreal, parade parade is a first-class entertainment, what movies are all about. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical treatment gives a cool edge to the material and its speed and delivery lines are breathtaking. They think they only started to make speeches feature pictures 7 years before! The brightness of the dialogue can not match anywhere today, especially considering that "realism" took over and swallows on contemporary movies. This movie was made at a time when the content Hayes content restriction was being ignored and the result was a cool, self-referential, critical and living movie theater directly to contemporary audiences suffer from the depression and the generous bitterness of the age. I would recommend watching any movie in that period, that is 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be.
