I'm not a fan of Steve Carell however I like this movie about Dan, a counselor columnist, who goes to his parents home for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that said before, but not like this. There are simply too many small bits that make the movie much better than it should be. Throwing is wonderful, and even though Carell is not my cup, it is quite as the widow who is supposed to know everything, but finding that knowing is different than feelings and that sometimes life surprises you. In the witty and wise moments of how an amicable Hallmark card can be, the movie still few how to manage to grow on you and be something more than a run of the movie mill. Worth a look see
