This is a movie I saw when it first came out, and which I saw a few times more in the years. It's always enjoyable. <br /> One thing is that the comedy does not take place: it skilfully works with capitalists equally. Only South looks out the classic struggle, though it's responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning: Do not read more if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, even if fairly fairly present. Ask yourself: Is anyone able to support most of her weight in one sheet of cloth? It would cut off almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also, when the edge of a go, South uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield. Beautiful symbols. <br /> One day, I'll get this on DVD.
