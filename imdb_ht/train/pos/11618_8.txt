Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Team of Dreams. This is one of the best stairs in 2005. A great draw. A great twist. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's biggest cinemas apart from "Calling" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) a challenging hotel manager, a red eye frame back to LA. Little she knows she was followed by the Jackson Ripner AKA Jack Riper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and finish sitting on the plane. Later he revealed that he was a killer who was sent to kill the Secret of National Security that stayed in Lisa's hotel. And what this is with Lisa. Well, he would have to move his room to the top suite so he can bomb it, if he does not rip off his father (Brian Cox). The twist and bring in the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. In general, definitely one of the best stairs in 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 4 stars
