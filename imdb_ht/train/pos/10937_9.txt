For all hoopla, the respect and appreciation of this film came from historian Koun Fu, he still lacks slowly in a couple of critical areas: action and battle scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five deadly venom without a doubt is a must see, not only that, a movie you can watch again and again; but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could be even better. It's somehow you want something, you want more. Chang Cheh's producers make up the scenario very well for a potential masterpiece but does not follow in and give us more of the action we want. The fighting styles of the movie really capture the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Angel, Frog) and they show, but the battles are noticeably short. The toad styles and snakes are particularly intriguing and should have shown much, much more, in fact the frog is dying off the movie. Interestingly enough with this movie, constant or abstract action or fight leads to the development of a great plot, this is one of some kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome. This movie has a dark and greedy tonic and you're drawn to the vibe. Disaster weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and added to the movies feel. For the start of the movie and featuring poisonous Chan Cheh's producer Clan takes us to a cache. The battlefield ends are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expect more. Always if this movie is one of my best Shaw and is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this: The fighter styles used to show us only and not present in detail, sad things are, the director had the goods for something extraordinary right in his right, , he did not expand on it. I left wondering what could be with this movie, always one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
