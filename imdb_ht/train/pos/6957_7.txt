My super-ex girlfriend is a fun movie no more no less. <br /> The story is quietly simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the train and hook up with him. At the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be OK, but then Matt finds out that she is G-girl. The first looks really cool Matt but it seems that G-girl is very jealous and unfortunate. So she decided to break up with her and hook up with her colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-girl very upset and starts avenging herself on her former companion. <br /> <br /> What I liked most of the movie is the scenes where G-girls avenge themselves on Matt. She was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role then her character in the scary movie legend. <br /> I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who loves a beautiful comedy.
