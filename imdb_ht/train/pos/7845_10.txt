So Fox pulls the Midway plug into a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How lame is that? Are they hoping to invest our time in their new show when there is a real risk never getting what's going on? Why did not they stay, already filmed the episodes entered in the U.S.? They were emitted elsewhere. <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you listen? This was a great show, but you let us hang. If you're going to introduce new drama / mystery, at least when a previous conclusion suddenly terminates mid-term. Whenever something like this happens (and it seems a lot with you - Yes, Fox), there are more people who will "wait and see" before investing their time. This means you will see an interestfully interested party, and are likely to finish the series. Look? It's a vicious cycle. Do not let us down again ...
