I just saw this episode tonight, on a recent-added presentation by one of our local independent channels, which is now featuring two weekday episodes. <br /> <br /> As the Opinion of the other, before commenting here, I agree this can not be one of the best programs in the series, but I find it fun though. <br /> <br /> My father was a friend of one of the principals (in my town, Cincinnati), for whom young Rod Serling worked in the media there - and I remember dad telling how talent and creative it came to mind. Overall "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the true classic TVs, and provides its output during the Cold War period, providing not only a view of the era of the country but also (today) a nostalgia picture in technical production, creative views and actors in this era several decades ago. <br /> <br /> * A particular story paints, as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story where the locale is meant to provide a "surprise" finish. Sometimes the characters of the earth, from elsewhere, while the first story implies at least one is an "Earthling." These usually contain the message (as here) in a situation promoted by the doomsday buttons that were finally pressed by the super powers during this Cold War period. <br /> <br /> See today, like this one story gives a nostalgic look at this world's world 4-5 years ago, and always gives some food-to-thought. - as this episode. <br /> While the dialogue has not been stretched to considerable talent in driving, it still presents a simple, important message, and a refreshing 20-minute minute of entertainment, and interest.
