Slow, but very well-rounded story of the American revolution. The story-telling Griffith looks a lot less heavy-lasting than its earlier historic thick and his charts work is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a pronoun pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but superbly and Carol Dempster is .... well, Carol Dempster is the most evil and Griffith in this period, but it does not show often enough to slow down the pace and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally in a little over 2 hours when first released, but that no cutting exists that runs longer than 90 minutes . However, the DVD release was presented at a faster FPS rate that increased the tension and brought it back in a bit more than two hours. <br /> <br /> Far better in terms of story-telling than sound version, such as the PATRIOT. While not quite in the league of the best Griffith, like WAY down EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.
