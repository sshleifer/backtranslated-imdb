An insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man's diving into crazy. Having chronic insomnia, Jack is plagued by hallucinations; causing it to try and determine what is real and what is not. <br /> We find interesting things about Jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is about we'll have a "happily ever after" Hollywood ends. Move. This is New York City, where there is no sleep. Tess Nanavati (Writer and Director) has himself a good film at The Insomniac's Nightmare. A talented cartoonist and writer (he made this movie right after his graduation high school), has real potential and will be one of the upcoming future look. <br /> As I watched this short film I was still uncomfortable; Between the music, weak landscape, and realistic paints in a ensomnayc by Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I desperately wanted to turn this at times just to escape out of it.
