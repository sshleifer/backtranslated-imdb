I absolutely LOVED this movie! I do not even deal with all the other comments I read about it. I was COMPLETELY enthralled in every second! <br /> I found the story captivating, acting intensely, and the spot-on direction. I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. Though there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, I was soundly on the edge of the entire movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /> I found that there were many perfect choices made ... The casting, the script, the little bits of humor whipped into it. There were many points in which the movie could go for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that I put this movie above for many of the mediocre gems that came out lately ... and for the last year.
