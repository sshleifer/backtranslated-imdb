The title has attracted my attention and then I wonder what will be out of the draw, as we've seen many "super-man" movies these years ... and in fact, I really liked it, even as there was a number of strange comic scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman has been doing as the average G-girl role. Surprising, I was still able to look her toe in wide screen (as at the start of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson however played the very good guy every day that meets the big woman, I could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch in fun, you should definitely watch the G-girl's adventurous and medium-sized, especially cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
