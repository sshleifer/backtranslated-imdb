The "Mother" is a low-budget movie, touching at least two comfortable and uncomfortable movies in the movie: denial of motherhood for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age. <br /> The terrible characters: May is a disgusting old woman and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her. He confessed that he did not love his son and his daughter. She deceived her husband twice with an intellectual. He steals the beloved man from his daughter, not protecting him from a moral guy without love, but just because he feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's illustrations. Her daughter Paula is a fragile deficit, who accepts her life in the way she is. Bobby, his brother is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists in having his shop, a terrible business really. Darren is an amorous twist of addiction that does not like anybody, even himself. Acting with the excellent directions: actors and actors have outstanding performance and the very precise direction. I loved this movie, but I acknowledge that it is recommended for highly specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Revenue" (Re-Start)
