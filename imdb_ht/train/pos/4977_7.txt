So many educational films are nothing more than self-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that the "MST3K" mock them ("Why Study Industrial Arts?" Come to Mind). The "Hemo Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It's all about blood, heart, and circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything out of it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but fun. I guess you can always count on June Foray (the most famous voice of the Rocky Squirrel, he plays a deer here). Since "Hemo Magnificent" in itself can be difficult to find, probably the best place to see it is at "Gremlins": a class watched it while a gremlin is being formed.
