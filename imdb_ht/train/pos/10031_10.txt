Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", named at its end (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's. I also asked about why this great movie, which won many awards and was applauded by many critics, was given only a rating of 7.0 by imdb.com users. <br /> Well, I look at the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a rating of 10, 10.7% gave it a rating 1. These 10.7% of these irrational imbb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /> In my previous comment, I blamed this very strange vote (a sudden wave of 1 ratings, with a 10 high rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the rating level 1) on one thing: hated for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I was hooked in chat rooms enough to see the gossip by young people (young, especially), who defame her left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and will have no part in giving him credit any of "Titanic". (To respond to another user: I'm not talking about someone who just really does not like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and it's right, his own taste. , no one can convince me that the imbb rating of only 7.0 in general for "Titanic", pulled at this level by a number of obvious amounts of 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Please note that . The "Gate of Heaven" (1980) was pulled out of the theater quickly after a very poor box office showing, and humid immersion voters were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). "Big Top Pee-Wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT DO ALL FAMILIES AND "TITANIUM"? ALL PERCENTAGES at 1 RATINGS are MORE !!!! NOT "TITANIK", AND NAME WHO THIS IS NOMINATED FOR ONE ONLY. Again, "Titanic" received 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare that in the other films I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Is there any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor? <br />
