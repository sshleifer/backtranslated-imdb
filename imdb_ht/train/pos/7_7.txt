Although I did not like Stanley & Iris much as a movie, I admired the act. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I was not always a fan of Fonda's work but here it is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role it portrays in gold acting. He gives a great performance in this movie and has a great scene where he needs to take his father to an elderly home because he can not care for him again that will break your heart. I would not really recommend this movie as a great entertainment cinemas, but I'll say you will not see much bet acting anywhere.
