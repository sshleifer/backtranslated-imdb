I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played part of the phenomenon and good heart. She plays a woman who leads to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police he realized he was on his own. Then one day when she's home alone strangers break into her home and attack her again. Not being called the police or finding him out he is forced to spit it in the eyes and imprison him in his stack. <br /> I think there is a need for a wake call of the laws of the country. They are too easy on such criminals. It's time for more harsh punishments.
