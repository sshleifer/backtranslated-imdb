I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noise and creepy kids. They usually miss originality and have overacting galore. The only horror movie I like was the Echo Brush and Kevin Bacon. He did well, and he had a great story. But he has joined and perhaps even surpassed Stanley Kubrick in the shining, quite possibly the horrible film ever. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agrees to watch over a hotel while it's closed for the winter. There were rumors in which they were haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced she will be OK and can use the quiet to overcome the writer's block. After months of loneliness and silence however, Jack became a grumpy and violent. Is it cabin cabin or has something in the hotel that drives her upset? <br /> One of the creepiest parties on the film is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick does. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are big, but still empty. It is also calm tremor when Jack's son rides his bike into the barn halls. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, hideous hell from me and make me sure to get out once in a moment. My favorite scene is when it's talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The shining is top for horror movies in my opinion, beat the snot from crap like the Ring and the Witch Project Blair. It can be an oldie, but it's definitely a goodie. 8/10
