"Ah Ritchie has made another movie Gangster and Statham" thought the average fan, hoping another Stock / Lock Lock; Expect perhaps a couple of temporal shifts, but not too difficult for "me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. Ah, pay attention, you need to watch this movie. No cup tea, no extra diet from the counter, no "keep it running" talk like you dive the fridge - watch the movie! There is no laughing matter than you can make yourself out of the considerable violence (and if that floats your boat, so is it), but strong direction, excellent dialogue, and great performance. from the Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
