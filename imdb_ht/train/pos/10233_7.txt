I was still keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not have the most humor of the most popular HK movies, nor a second line of storytelling that has been dragged into the movie. The story is not complex but never scene that just has to fill some "intelligent" space (only the intelligent films of martial arts films I've seen are tiger crickets, but since Hollywood is involved it's not true HK movie for me). Some incredible battles scene in this movie, from the first one (which is one of the coolest I've ever seen, yet so short) to the latest scenes! But yourself, there is also a lot of blood that shed (people cut in half, decapitals, etc.). The production is very good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even if some shots must be very technical (notice: the sheet that he launches and received is estimated in a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or Jan Woo who made my favorite movie Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure hell will check out more from this director! Ace.
