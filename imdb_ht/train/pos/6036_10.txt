I am not determined by the target audience for this movie. I'm a nearly 50 man who has just recently stumbled around the world of independent films. This happened quite accidentally, with the discovery of a movie called Klerks late a night on TV. First of the things I noticed about that movie was that it was 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliant writing. When I read an interview with the director of the local paper and said one of his influences was Klerks, I started to get interesting. When she told her main influence was Agent Station, a movie I saw on DVD a week earlier, I decided I was going and checked it out. The result could be described on the same lines as clerks, although the two films have nothing to do with the same content. Both films suffer from technical gaps that are overcome in amazing writing. Whereas Klerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life all and afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, less like me is about a man who lost his strength to be always busy, he always runs one way or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. The terms and ideas of this film are strong and intensive. I can say in his view that not much has changed since I was growing up, young men always have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses these issues with the modern traditional theme, honest craftsman honest characters, and makes them things credible. As far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint, but in an artistic one, it is very close.
