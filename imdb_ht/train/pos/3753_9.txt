This short movie that inspires the full length-to-full feature feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece of cartoon similarity that gives multiple writers. The short movie stars Edward Spatula who after being fired in his work, joins in the fight against the wrong spoons. Mostly this allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the rest of the feature. This 15-minute film time absorbs some odd-ball comedy and a small number of music. Unfortunately, many other things lie below. The scheme that set up does not really have time to show. But it's probably following it to draw better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This movie is worth at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
