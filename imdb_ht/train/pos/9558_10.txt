So I consider myself very big at the anime scene, and very few shows I simply will not look. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend anyone. <br /> <br /> Properly possible the most original series of dates, read; was just about everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very well put together voice acting cast (both Japanese and American translations). <br /> Not for the terribly humorous aspect of it, it would be, just another animated. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I've noticed, a 'liked it or hate it, very few people I've seen introduced in this series will end up with a disaster for it. <br /> Original to the core, and everything you might require in an afternoon, bet the house on this set. I am ready to make sure you will enjoy it.
