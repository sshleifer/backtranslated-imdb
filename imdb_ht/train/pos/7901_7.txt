Worst movie ever? Wow, whoa right now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's all about what you expect a movie to do for you. I live in Oregon, so I got to enjoy the very well-filmed shots of familiar still amazing Smith rock and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the sweet cats in our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on the baby Sissy baby crib at the start of the movie). These people alone were enough to give me the movie a better than "average" score. .... Or ... maybe it's all about what your expectations have. Having read the AGES book ago, and thinking of myself "goodness, no one can make a movie out of this interesting, original, bizarre book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (MORAYS - can not put in accent marking online) has changed "- I was actually very jokingly surprised when I first looked at the movie when she came from 1994 and even loved her more today watching her again. <br /> <br /> Sizi has been utterly discarded, and I do not care what you all said, I was also pleasantly surprised by Phoenix's rain performance and Jan Hurt's performance. I'm not a lesbian or purposeful, but they have met how many people and their folks are supposed to show - with these "real" as they act like those actors. Infiltrate a bit, step-by-step - always a bit "off." Gus Van Center is one strange Oregonian native, but not garsh it does a great job to adapt this crazy book, IMHO.
