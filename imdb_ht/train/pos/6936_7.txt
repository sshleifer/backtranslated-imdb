Winchester 73 gets the crucial credit for bringing back the west after WWII. Director Anthony Mann has to get a lot of credit for her excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the film and painted them into two bad guys involved in a high performance poker game and the Treasure Winchester 73 goes to the winner. This is a good script and several stories go on at the same time. Look for the appearance of the first Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, and in a few years, we would begin to let Indians play themselves in the western film. The film is in black and white and shot at Arizona Tucson. I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach, High Midi or Shane, but it has become an average recommendation above me. <br /> <br />
