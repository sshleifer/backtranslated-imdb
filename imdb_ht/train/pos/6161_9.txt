Set in WWII, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids, starting Angela Lansbury as a witch-studded who, with the help of three children evacuated with a 'Professor of Magic', twists a Nazi invasion. <br /> Brilliantly invented, with loads of laughter, this movie will delight children of all ages and great characters, exciting stories and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-well-perfect witch who takes three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and its three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are as impressive as Cockney's rascals that help in the nasty Hun battle. The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, the kids do not care too much about these things, as long as they entertained. And entertained, they will. With some impressive scenes that brighterly mix live action and animation into great effect, and more movie magic films than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful installment of Cinemas escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out music number put in Portobello Road masks the movie's perfection, but with many other things to enjoy, which can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> And besides, any movie featuring UK TV legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv guaranteed a good rating from me.
