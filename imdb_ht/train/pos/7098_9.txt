"Twelve Monkeys" got all the elements to become the leader of Terry Gilliam. An exceptional scenario, a rhythm sustained, intelligent sometimes ironic dialogue. In addition, he had a good nose on the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the character type he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character that you could name a prisoner took over from a fearless and irresistible hero (as it was the case of "dead hard"). No matter how it tries, it's a prisoner at the time. The movie has a very startling sequel too. He got a real dramatic power. But this dramatic movie is also a reflection on people, the dangers it dreads (notably, those that can cause the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can create disease). No matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the leaders made in the nineties.
