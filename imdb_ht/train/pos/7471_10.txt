Although excellent trailer for wind vanilla, I was hoping to be disappointed in the movie because I would hear that he did not get big reviews. However, I left the movie completely in awe of how good vanilla sky. <br /> There was no bad act at all in the entire movie, every single character is credible. Romantic moments between Cruise Character, David Aames and Cruz's characters, Sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a couple-to-be real couple of lives). The plot of wind vanilla will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there's plenty of luck at you to guess the finish. However, finishing them tied towards the end, leaving you with a strange mix of feelings including sadness, trauma and sympathy for David Aames. The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention to all. This is not difficult because the odds are that you will be completely drawn to the movie and will not take your eyes on the screen for a second. <br /> I always let the movie forget everything about the movie just watch. But the vanilla sky still persists in my mind's day after watching it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change of simple, deep film.
