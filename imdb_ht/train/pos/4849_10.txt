The Holy Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical humor of 1940. It incorporates World War Two into the plot, but not as much as I initially believe it would, and the characters are a unique mix that plays their role fairly well. Instead, playing the role of Tommy Gander, that's the bright story up to the party that could be described as boring or "dragging". The story of the haunting station is actually spooky even for present day standards. It is unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is fantastic brutal up the mystery of the Holy Train. Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members throughout the rest to get along fairly well. It is always center of attention and may armed as being "annoying" but this is not the one who does not appreciate the 1940s humor. Her mood is innocent and childish that makes her sweet to look. <br /> <br /> If it was not for Askey / Gander, than this film would have been shorter in action, enjoying and the result would not be effective in my opinion.
