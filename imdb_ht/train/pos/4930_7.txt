"Panic in the streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little bit ashamed of it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a disease in modern times is fascinating, but the movie never really explores or develops it. It's nice and fun, but it's not as interesting as it should be. Simply for this one is really weak and bring the whole movie down. None of the central characters are really compelling or credible. Fortunately, the film is very well done to compensate for the weak scripting. The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the movie thriller and moves at a lightning speed. There are some standout sequences, particularly smaller chips in chase. When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, this man could especially not do any harm. The act is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a watchman who is leading and doing what he can with a character written alphabet. Paul Douglas spent his time shouting a bit too much but doing a decent job as well. The statutes of the cast are the villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for its comic role, is effectively thin as one of the ultimate movie cinema characters. Jack Palance is, surprisingly, a cruel refrigerator. "Panic in the streets" is disappointing but still worth seeing. (7/10)
