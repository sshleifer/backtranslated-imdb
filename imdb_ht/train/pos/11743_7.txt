Although this was not his perfect, this drama was a fitting one to be shown around Easter time. He reminded us of our spiritual head and showed that behind our facades, we often hide our deepest suffering and experiences. There was plenty to enjoy in the drama, not least rapping the adolescents who gave a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the poor sound sound in the background. The act was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again superb. The highest score was very satisfying, though rather simplistic. Spall's children "let go" in his long-dead wife's suicide was credible and reflected well of the feelings of despair present in the self-injuring girl. The resolution between the boy graffiti and the Muslim was pleasantly but less credible. A wonderful drama that left me and my husband dropped that evening was well spent. Congratulations!
