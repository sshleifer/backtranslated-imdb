I bought this shortly ago but somehow neglected to look it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. And then I have to admit that he is a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely credible, and I did not think "Brad Pitt" at all. Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files and I've had to look twice to confirm this movie, as I thought she did a few years later. I love Duchovny but found her character a little two-dimensional here, except where she's making voice-overs. This part was strong, seemed to character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise I kept thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did not I notice it before? (I'll look up to see what other roles he does and see these asap) I am even concerned about stereotyping re Lewis, this movie, and "Natural Sniper" (a favorite farm). Interestingly though they see a contrast of character - in NBK it is a pleasurable accomplice, whereas here it abhors the violence and tries very hard not to recognize the dark side of the eve until it's pushed to his face. <br /> I enjoyed this movie almost over. Apart from Duchovny's character does not seem completely-formed (and perhaps they were "washed out" a little bit by the Pitt), it was perfect. I was also happy with the end - happy that the innocent heroes did not die, yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic, turbulent, disturbing. <br /> If you like NBK you can easily like this movie, with vice versa.
