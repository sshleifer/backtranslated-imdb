John Garfield plays a navy that is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. He has all stereotypes on blindness, and he is sure it will be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his injured partner can not get into him. Nor can her girl come home playing by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blind by his own fears, self-pity, and prejudice. It's a complex role that Garfield brings on memorable to a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever-present melodrama smile. The best scenes are about Guadalcanal, where it is in a machine gun nest trying to unravel in the advanced Japanese soldiers in a night battle battle night battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a railway platform with a white cane, black glasses, and holding out a cup of tin, all while his girlfriend walked away from the camera.
