Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The film is well written and the act looks like real life. For all lovers of Columbo this is a superior piece of work. Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is. It does not play a detective it plays a retired carpet vendor. Since credit starts the role you want to look at it again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to everybody watching it; The depth of its relevance will be the only thing that varies. It's a shame that the liberals in Hollywood only encourage smudge and skin because this is the kind of movie that people in the business should be proud of. This would be a great movie turning into a live stage play.
