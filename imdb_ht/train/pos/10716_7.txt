I'm watching this on the overseas overseas World Cup that buys US and Canadian series last one or two seasons like the Jane show. I thought of as many comedians coming to comedy I actually can look at my own, Lucy, shelter, I dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes empty type I can not think of any which others, women are all supported by the lead. So for me, Jane's show is in very good company. One thing I just thought of though. I watched many things to do in Canada, and I never remember anything that was being filmed in a regular TV show showing SNOW! It's all done at the height of summer, lol! Granted it's a good place to live wise climate in the summer but you would think, would show a little bit of Canada in the winter since this part of the form has also been. I mean SCTV, just to laugh at yourself as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in Canada with very little or no injection and present snow though they both did a lot of outdoors. I dig but I kind of chuckle in Jane and her obviously liberal way being accused of her neighbor's racism, and I love the bald and crazy guy I found it on par with a UK series called Her People ( I think) another comedy office with a female lead. Not by any means the best comedy ever, but for a guy to say she can look at her alone, saying something. If I was with my wife she would really enjoy it since she addressed sex in the office and things like that would be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 of 10.
