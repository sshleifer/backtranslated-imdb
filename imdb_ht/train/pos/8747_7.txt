* Spoilers Possible * Although doing first (and better) at 'Midnight Express' and 'Back to Paradise', Brokedown Palace always hits a code with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls who travel to Thailand, and are arrested on charges of drug trafficking. Is it Clare Danes' Alice? Is it Darlene Kate Beckinsale? Was it the strange stranger to meet on their journey? None of that really is important, for this is a story of friendship and confidence and the boundaries they can stretch out. Throw in Bill Pullman as an impatient advocate and Jacqueline Kim as her Thai bride (and best lawyers than she is) and we have a wonderful little story that keeps the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept, it does not show sensational violence that leads to the wannabe-avant-garde mobility to talk about it in " real courageous "or" tricky truth "- it's simply a good story with some fine performances. Bill Pullman is weaker and lacks his lazy and serious way of talking - I was quite bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, while decent, is nothing spectacular. It does well, but it's not exactly a memorable performance. Jacqueline Kim, however, is in fine form, elaborating a characteristic and definite character where, really, there is not much to work with. > <br /> But make no mistake - this is Clare Danes' movie. I have long been a fan of his work, and this is not a change. She captivated in every scene she appeared, and it was not for her, the film would probably lower in boring fare. I particularly applauded her performances in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a sparkling band. <br /> 7 out of 10
