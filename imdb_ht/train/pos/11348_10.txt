I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I called each time I looked at her. It was not strange to me. I totally identify with the characters. I would like to see her again (and hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rock !!!! I was really drawn to the fantasy world. And my movie was loooong. I wonder if I ever saw the series and were confused? The act I thought was strong. I liked Jack Wilde. He was so dreamed of a 10 year old (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970. I can always remember the characters clear. The thump was totally credible and I can always 'feel' the wrong woods. Witchy proposal was scared - I would not want to cross his road.
