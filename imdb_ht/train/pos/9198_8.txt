B movie? Yes. Brick? Yes. First Movie? Yes. But Aestheically A +. This movie definitely has some bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc .. etc. problems. However, this film has a lot of positive things about it. The first, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it was made to be a movie parody / comic B rated horror movie. Our killer comments make his victim leave me with my friends rolling around on the street floor. <br /> <br /> The problem is a lot of people trying to capture all independent films and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a lot of kids from high school made their first movie. For what it is, just that, it is really good.
