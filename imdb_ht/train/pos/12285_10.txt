Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous families of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a huge real estate arising out of the ruins, becoming an abuse force and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of Esteban Trueba's upstart and his musician, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the harder of its history of Chilean stubborn nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarity and it is inevitable: remember, as an example , that image of the senator and dark glasses that make him wink in the general to start doing the palace). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! In Esteban apply the law of resonance, wisely, Solomon describes in these words: "The things that the freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Unbelievable Glenn Closed Play The sly, stained sister of Stephen, whose sin, is driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his wicked snowmen. Meryl Streep is also brighter, a woman whose name comes to her as a Clara glove. With the power of telekinetic, cognitive and mediocrity, this hardened woman, loyal to her blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we want for ourselves and for all human beings. Each character is a virtuoso portrait (like Blanca deserves rebel leader Pedro Segundo happy ...) or a humiliation portrait, such as Stephen Jr., the battalion child of Senator, who serves as an instrument to return to the boomerang. The film moves the bowels, we recreate some facts that should never be repeated, but that is still absurd (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, all of a life is wonderful because there are still people like Isabel Allende and just bail outright.
