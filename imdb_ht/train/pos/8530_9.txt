Not sure why it does not play in Peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny, smart British comedy. It set the end of the "sixty rhythm". Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-serious womanizer. Goldie Hawn's best dealer, playing a 19-year-old Indian girl in London, is, initially, "catching the day" Sellars. But critics of urban urban foods can not stop itself from falling for the blonde American white. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, strong performance from driving and helmet support. It's a great movie, and the best file is the very latest line. <br /> Try it, you will love it.
