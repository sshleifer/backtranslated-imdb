On December 28, 1895, at Grand Café in Paris, film history was written during Louis Lum showed his short film, all single shots, at a paid hearing. The 'Outline of Usines Lumière' was the first movie to be played and I wish I was there, not only to see the movie, but also the reactions to the audience. <br /> We start with closed doors in the glow factory. Apparently, since the image looks like a picture, people thought they were just going to see a slippery show, not something they hoped for. But then the doors open and people are streaming out, home titles. First a lot of women, then some people, with one person on a bicycle and a big dog. When all the doors were closed again, <br /> Whether this is the first movie or not (some say 'The Arrival of a Train Through The Coyote' movie was the first recorded film), it is an impressive piece of movie early. Being bored this is close to impossible for many reasons. A simple reason: it's only fifty seconds long. But also for those who normally only like the movie of special effects must have something interesting here; You do not get to see historical things like this everyday.
