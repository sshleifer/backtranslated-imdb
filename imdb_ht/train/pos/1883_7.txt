Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Liza Minnelli and good talking John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man who is part of a multimillionaire family, who was near $ 750 million to be married to a lady (Susan) to another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepts the requirements, but he finally refuses to meet beautiful and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur although the letter knew that his life would change in the upcoming future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. Rich people are not happy with their way of life.
