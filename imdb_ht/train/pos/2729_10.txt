I've been voting for the good act, not for the content. She always gives me the thrill after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ancient consciences are traveling to their destination to steal a family of money from a security one at the concert learned on while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins on the mountain, as the soundtrack of the film adds to anticipation in general. After the killers are doing and work in the garden, this morning, the rest of the family is found in the church's daughter's friends. The blood-rosewood, as well as the panels on the phone and the cut off, really make my blood cold and it gives me shiver. That killers are just because they just have a little comfort for that family to finish. Robert Blake was excellent in his painting of Perry Smith. The book was excellent written by Truman Capote.
