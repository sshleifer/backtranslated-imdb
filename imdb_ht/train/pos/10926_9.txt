If you love kung-fu movie and you have not seen this film, you are copying yourself. This film is one of only Kung Fu fuels that could be recommended for fans of all kinds of films. Normally, he takes a dead-hard fan of the genre to see anything in the movies, but this one has it all! The story is well said and completed. The fighting scene is great, and they tend to finish before you're completely bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck in a movie. Look at this one at all costs. Heck, my wife liked it. <br /> <br /> Wu See it! <br /> 9 from 10 <br />
