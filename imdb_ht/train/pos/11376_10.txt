This has to be one of the best films about serious assassins that I've ever seen, and this will come from someone who absolutely loved the silence of the lambs. HBO has hit the skin here. This film is compelling from the first moment up to the last. <br /> This movie has many hidden terms it's hard to say exactly what it is about. It's the decade-long research story for the Andrea Chikatilo's Russian assassin series. Stephen Rea provides a brilliant performance as the forensic inexperienced expert who puts in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland provides a more accomplished performance as his superior cinema, and the only person in the Russian government wants to help him '. Both of their performances are subtle heads --- Rea starts naive and wants to compromise, while Sutherland begins to detach and almost amused by the situation. In the end, Rea gets more world-tired and beats in the system, while Sutherland finds itself more passionate and idealist. <br /> In any other movie, I would say that Sutherland's performance is above the rest, but here it is rivals by Jeffrey DuMann, as the head assassin himself. DuMann brilliant creates a character here that inspires sympathy rather than hatred we think we would find --- it is a monster, but it does not want, and we get the idea that it is just as disgusting to what it does as we yeah. It is tortured, shameful, but vicious. <br /> If you can take the subject extremely incredibly black (and it is * very * disturbing), then you should see this movie.
