We've watched this on the "Wonderful Disney World" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things should be kept tighter in the "mouse" than usual. Since this movie only runs 74 minutes, and has been blocked from 2 hours of broadcasting TV time, being, and I have not done this, commercial breaks lasted 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks, there was another advertisement in the guise of a "TV show" hosted by oh-so-harassed Kelly Rippa who loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". Again and again, breaking down after breaking, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we need to get a copy of the end. Thanks, Disney, to serve us to create an end to the beloved gem in a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this commercialization with cash-registering-ringing has made it a difficult task to get into the current movie of "Cinderella", because by the time advertisers were on , I forgot where the story was left. <br /> But of course, the original "Cinderella" still holds its magic, and history is always a good, though we've all seen it countless times. It's a shame that he has to be cheaper with all the marketing for what seems to be a lame track-up.
