Have seen this movie on DVD yesterday and it was gob-spiced and flabbergasted. The act affected by DDL just blown my mind, and I was surprised at the whole cast with its superb acting. All the characters were so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go and see it! You will cry your heart out, but you will experience a wonderful cartoon! In addition, it teaches you an important lesson: Determination is everything. You can be a crisis in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problem at all. If you can only operate your left foot are always good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you mentally challenged is to appreciate yourself-pity. It will not find you anywhere and the sole person who will pity you will be yourself.
