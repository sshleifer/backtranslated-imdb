On her face a movie about women wanting to see a football match would not appeal to a lot of people with little interest in football like myself but this is not about football she is about discriminating and enthusiastic women for the sport Love the movie opens on a crucial World Cup cruise match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl trying to get into the Azadi Tehran stadium by dressing as a boy, it seems he will get in until a soldier tries to dig it . Once taken it was taken to a high enclosure up the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who have already been caught, here are guarded by a small group of conscription soldiers who prefer to go back home . We never learned the character name but we get to know them as people as girls are struggling with guards leaving them to look even if a space near the wall and when refuses to try to get them at least give a Next. <br /> <br /> As well as making an important point on the rigid sex segregation in many of Iran's present day films have many hilarious moments as "disguised" one of the girls being put when going to the bathroom and the girl who disguised himself as a soldier and was only caught because he chose to watch the match from a reserved chair for a senior officer. Girl enthusiasm for the game is such that at the end of the viewer is likely to be on the edge of the seats hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals of Germany. Soldiers do not show as fundamentalists, they are the only highlight because they have to be and when they explain the girls why women can not look at the sport's men do not seem convinced by their own arguments. <br /> It's a shame that this movie can not be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and so see that ordinary Iranians are not a bunch of desperate fanatics in wages war on the west but normal people with the same passions and anxieties as people everywhere. The cast made a great job of making characters look like real people rather than caricatures only.
