Everyone plays the parties very well in this "cute movie". Belushi gets the chance to live a part of his life differently, but finishing up can accomplish what he's going to be just as good or maybe even better. The movie shows us that we must take advantage of the opportunities we have, not what we do or can not. If u can get this movie on video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
