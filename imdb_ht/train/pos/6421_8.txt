"Honest Man" - true story of a proud and intriguing black maroon (Fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains with it in part of the sheer cream of the new millennium movie theater. Beautiful acting is the main reason to make this movie something really special and beautifully enjoyable, splendid experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as brutal, fierce and incompetent ruler Billy Sunday - the role is practically written for him. This film and fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) are two of the latest evidence that it is still one of the very finest actors of our time. On the other hand "Honored Men" includes a fine performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. which was one of the most promising young black actors since the "boyz n hood". "Men in Honor" go straight to the company of "Jerry Maguire", "As Good as It Has Come" and "Instant". Kiba Gooding Jr. is a skillful and fantastic actor and I'm ready to get a lot of more terrific movies from him. "Men in Honor" was also quite an excellent-line story and probably the most exciting films in the film story. This is a great, fascinating fascinating and I can only recommend it.
