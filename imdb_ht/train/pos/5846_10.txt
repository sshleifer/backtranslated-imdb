It was about 7:30 am, too close to school to see very often. The animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea of ​​cowboys & people usually relaxed throwing cars and robots was amazing. Perhaps it inspires Treasure Planet. <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in the DVD format. Their displays are all basically identical. When watching non-sequential episodes on a DVD, you are stoned by disk # 3. By today's standards, the animation is spot. We do not notice the computer graphics again and focus on how to blow the characters instead. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the heroine characters. They were a lot more credible, persuaded more seriously than modern heroines, and they did not corny. They actually save people.
