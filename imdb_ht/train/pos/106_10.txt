The first movie in Trier I've ever seen breaks the waves. Make a beautiful movie but it definitely stands in the shade of europe. Europe tells a story of a German-American youth who wants to experience Germany just after World War II. It takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a prosecutor on a luxury train. Because of his work, he traveled all through a Germany almost totally destroyed, meeting and killing of treachery, and hunting for former Nazi party members. The society suffers from corruption. Her uncle has reduced her consciousness to focussing on the job she also had as a haul on the train. By coincidence the main character involved in shelling and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' to put pressure on it to help them set bombs on trains. The atmosphere is surprising. The viewer is taken to the scene of a scene by a man trying to put the viewer under hypnosis and then count your awakening to a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
