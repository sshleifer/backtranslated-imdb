I felt this movie - at all. I waas impressed with Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, as a typical Aussie mix of gently approaching, somewhat self-depreciating and very persistent. Really liked movies and directions. Pace was just right and the portraits of almost all characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, was not Russell's talent even in 1993 shining! .. and I have yet to see Gladiator.
