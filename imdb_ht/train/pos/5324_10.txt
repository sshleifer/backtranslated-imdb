Having just watched this movie again from a 1998 show in VH-1, I just commented. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV, it was about 1981, and I remember tied it off to my mother betamax. He was wound up in black and white for some reason, which gave him a watch period that I grew up to love. <br /> I remember the film's very distinction starting with the song, "Bonnie I", as camera hangs on a scene in Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene where Paul gestures of some girls and said, "Look, talent!" So it was with great irritation that I popped in 1998 my version featured and "remembered" that the movie opens with "He Loves You", instead of "Bonnie I". When you see how slowly the camera cameras vs. the speed of the music, you can see that "He loves you" just does not fit. Also, in this "later" version when Paul saw the girls, he said, "Look, girl!" .. and somehow have remembered the earlier version, this word just did not seem to fit, either. Why was it felt the American movie was for the American audience is beyond me. Personally, if I'm going to watch a movie on a British band, I want all of British brokolalisms and that would be part of their speech, styling, etc. <br /> Another irritation was how to "shake" the correction was for TV. Just after Stu gets beat, for example, the movie cut into a commercial break-lot of 'em. Yeah, I know it depends on the network, but it really breaks the effect of a movie having it trench apart, as we all know. Which few people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue (and consequently okay edit), can actually go in ways to explain a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> My point is, the "best" version of this movie was probably the earliest version I had stuck out in 1981, which just got to include the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" version 1998 I did not. I began to suppress that there were two different versions made for TV, and a look at the "alternate versions" links regarding this movie proved me right. This American version has some shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a great disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if someone cares about things. Imo, they even bet better is to try and get a hold of the European version of this movie, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unnecessary version. Unfortunately, I had to throw my old betamax European version because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> All that aside, I found this movie to be, perhaps, one of the best films regarding history behind the "birth of the Beatles". Knowing that artistic and creative licenses are commonly used in movies and television when they show events in history, I did not let any marred my disagreement in the movie. Sure you see Beatles singing in the cavern who made me wonder, "Are they even writing back then I do not think so" but, nevertheless, I thought it was a great movie and performance they are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The real stand-out for me, in fact, was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I just about to fall in love with her. Watching him, manierism, personality and voice talk seemed to be spot-on. He watched as a young man to make a double-taken towards the movie end when you see the Beatles perform on Ed Sullivan for the first time. I actually found myself questioning whether he was current Beatle foot, until I saw the other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an accurate dead story of Beatles life and start, you can not find any better than, "The Beatles Anthology", as it was "written" by boy they ', themselves. However, if you are looking for a fun snapshot in the pre-Beatlemania days leading up to the Americas and you leave your ratings of criticism at the door, you can not go wrong with the "birth of the Beatles" - be for any "real" or fans of Beatle fans.
