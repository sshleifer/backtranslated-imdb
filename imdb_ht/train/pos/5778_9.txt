Despite its budget limit, this is a great movie, proof that efforts and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-painted paintings show how some dinosaurs at least survive in the age of human beings, are a pretty red herring. And a meteor goes down to a lake and causes heat that, in turn, causes peel to a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave paintings suggest that instead this is not the first time as something happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a well-animated Plesiosaur that is soon causing extinction of the local area. Well, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.
