Big S does not play with taboos or force an agenda like, says Mencia or Chapelle (though I like them both). It states the obvious of subtle, subliminal remarks near. Show it will not change the world, nor is it meant to be. But along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and the ex-boyfriend Paget Jayston Brewster's "Mr. Show" fame, this is one show show and an appetite for destruction! My side was well crushed by the first episode. See, I love this woman and loves her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and allows the viewer to run-and-read. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything with anyone, such as "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sang the fake birds on quick hit book about society and college of age existential existence existance. This one is highly recommended, but only for people who still have a funny bone (and did not lose it in the most recent lipo-aspiration treatment or labor jobs).
