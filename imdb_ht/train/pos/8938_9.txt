A wonderful movie version of the best-selling book and Broadway book played on the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who both lived on the age of 100 and told the stories of a century's witnesses American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll provide very good performance as Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also as good as Amy Hill hostel, New York Times white reporter whose articles on the sisters have launched the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of these present-day are very powerful, if not quite as inspiration as in the book. That's just the real disadvantage, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story do not show clearly, as the inter-racial background of their mother's mom and why their dad was so tough. But other than that, a very well-done, excellent make, powerful movie.
