When I said in this movie I thought it would be another chick flick. I was guilty. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommend this movie. No one came to say it was bad. Busy, also made a great job with her role in this movie. I do not know much about his career acting but wow, the way he pulls at the end of this filling was great. <br /> At the beginning it was a little slow. But after he went to the hospital .... Wow, the movie is selected again. I have no idea why this movie has not spoken of in the movie world. Want me to be this movie to be released again and publish more ... because it sends a powerful message within an hour and a half hours.
