I'm very picky about the movies I see. I would hear about the moon full moon by accident. I was a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time with a fan of Gackt and Mizer just recently. <br /> I've finally found out the movie being re-released and pick it up without a second thought. <br /> You must be as critical as I'm on film, I'll admit, the action scenes can be a bit hokey at times ... but they will also mean be, as another user suggests, it's the first excellence calm The storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leon ... without getting into the deflators, the movie hit me very hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendships are unlimited and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty to Love the marriage, it's until your death belongs. Hyde and Gackt provide performance that shows why they can commit the depths of the song lyrics, the passion for music happening on the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach the soul one and coaxically emotional response . <br /> When you see the movie for the first time, I realize it will probably stay in heavier rotation as far as my collection goes. I want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the movie if you want to get away from Hollywood's current film trends ... This takes an entirely new direction using classic Yakuza movie component and how you can go wrong with a came out of Ryo Ishibashi at Takashi Miike in "Audition" and "Suicide Club" fame? <br /> <br /> Man .. I just can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. /> 10/10
