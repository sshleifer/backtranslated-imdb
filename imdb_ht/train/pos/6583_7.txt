This era packs the surprising amount of surprises, thrills, mysteries and anxieties about a bloody battle in Sherlock against Charles Augustus Milverton, a master blackmailer. This is an excellent exposure covered by Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the movie Holmes's normal cannon appears as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, but no Moriarty, however, is an older villain, Charles Augustus. It is a thread that is enriched with intrigue, emotions, and suspicions, including an interesting twist. This is a particular Sherlock film but we get Holmes fall in love with a servant, kiss, cry and even steal. This time with the episode of Bohemia and Irene Adler, the results must be the only one that Holmes is romantic. Top-performing Brett performances, along with Peter Cushing, are the best Sherlock TVs, while the movie is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett does as a resolution, headstrong, fairly reckless. Here Dr. Watson is not a comic, botcher, and clumsy personified by Nigel Bruce, but is a crafty and cunning partner invented by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpart of Brett. Casting is frankly magnificent, special mention to Robert Hardy as nasty mess. Hardy, today famous by Row Fudge Cornelius in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor and forty years of career and several successes such as the 10th and Winston Churchill. In addition, appearing sexy actors and terrific performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The film has become a colorful atmosphere, London streets and 221 Baker Street homes are well-designed. The motion picture is directed by Peter Hammond, director of various episodes. It is a must see for the fans Arthur Conan Doyle.
