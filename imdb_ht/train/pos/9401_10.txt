What a wonderful movie, which is highly qualified for many labels, has never become: science fiction, film-noir, and a script of high intelligence dialogues that are supposed to be educated, cultured audiences ..... types of English language only made in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA movie film film when it first came), and never ever made in the USA. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! "and then communicate the importance of the average man and science of benefit to him. </ B> <br /> Man in the White Costume (1951) is the opposite of the video-game blast films that now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate the largest USA cinema ...... It's a carefully acting, intelligence telling story delivered by gifted and credible educated English actors (which educates, accomplishes people), and it all does with comedy, charm, pathos, and irony that dramatic vintage Greek would approve of. Everyone should see this movie, and someday, some filmmakers deserve and their supporters should do something like it. <br /> It's wonderful.
