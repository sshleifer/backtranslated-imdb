I saw "pig serum" sort of accident; he played on the plane to Europe. It actually was not half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is # 1 Red Sox in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can strain that. The film is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. It's especially eye-opening now that the Red Sox finished sketching the 80-odd-year loss. I guess that these kinds of things happen all the time and we just do not tend to notice them. Not too bad. <br /> Another film that shows a baseless relationship of baseball is the 2000 "Frequency". Check out them both out.
