This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I did not see any cameos in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It looks like Anchorman in the Humor Department, but I think this is a better movie set. It actually has a point. If you will see a whole bunch of T & A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean, I do not really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I'll agree on. The movie has a good enough story that it is actually credible that these types of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how to treat virginity in this movie. Yes, sure, you get to laugh when she finds out, but it's always suggested that you wait. Steve did a great job of showing the person that he did in this movie and again, it's still funny.
