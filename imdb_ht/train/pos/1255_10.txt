This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why many here are hitting this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who outwits a white teacher. A black cop that tells the white teacher is wrong to defend the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be good, so. ?? make the professor white look stupid. It always comes down to race. This is an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to racism. If you can find on that there are characters that are played by black in this movie that outsmart the white characters, then you should not have any problems enjoying this movie. I recommend everyone to see this movie.
