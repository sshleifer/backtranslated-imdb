I bought this one of my favorite DVD movies ever and as usual, while watching, everything just blown me away. <br /> I'm a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and Soundtrack this movie just was me in tears, especially the "Do you" track. It is a much nostalgic journey for me back to my youth. This is the second best Quadrophenia (which also insults Phil Daniels). A great band with a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the 80 crimes in which I grew up. The finish is so sad, for hours after the end of my movie as a baby blubbering. <br /> I hope to put out this DVD from repeatedly watching, I can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your father's love. God bless you all. xx
