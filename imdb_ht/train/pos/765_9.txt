I guess when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one dance break and the rest was dance jazz and ballet. It was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was the best. The only movie that could rival "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both movies focus on how dance is used by people to express their utmost feelings. <br /> <br /> The Break-Dance Scenes of "Beat Street" come just before the middle and the end of the flick. And I loved all of them. Almost all of the crush tricks have appeared in the jam scenes breaks: the jackhammer, the flares, the top turn, sitting in suicide, the legs crazy, the mortal, the flip forward, the face figure --- almost everything. /> <br /> Like the "warriors", "Beat Street" has violence related to the gang life of the hip hop world ... but in a less violent manner than the former. The biggest battle scene at "Beat Street" was when Ramon's artwork (which was abbreviated as "ramo") is being pursued by a rival gang member on the New York City train tracks ..... fight one and others on the third train and both dead by electro-train on that train. Well, although that tragedy ended up being tragic, it was better that they were killed in this way than without exploding in a gang candle. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang stuff in the fiction were graffiti related to hip-hop culture, and rap music. A lot of rap music has appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members use rap music as a rehabilitation of negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the film, which closed the veil of the flick, was not just a hip-hop culture homage - it also was a homage to Ramon. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the hole orchestra made by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a comic appearance.
