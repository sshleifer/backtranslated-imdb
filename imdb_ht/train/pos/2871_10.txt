Comments? Like my comment is needed? We are talking about all time, for all seasons and generations. This is just the kind of movie that I always have the patience to watch. In that, as in Disney's other movies are some kind of magic. All the characters in a way, "alive" and "real" so it's easy to understand messages, even if you do not understand language, (like I did not understand when I first looked at movie, because I was about six years old). Perhaps my English is not so good, but I've learned what I know especially in this kind of movie, and that's just one bigger dimension to this kind of movie, which in the present time is scarce. But there is one big shame. In my country is now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyrights, so our kids with disabilities are enjoying and learning in this kind of cinema. So, we'll watch this movie again "Once upon a Dream" or ...?
