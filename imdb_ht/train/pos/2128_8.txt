I just watch this on Turner Classic Movies last night, for the first time ever to see it, and I loved it. I love so much of the older films, especially because of the absence of every language of the room, with excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. I also think that they did better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to look, and I enjoyed it well. If you feel the same way about the older films I do not think you can go wrong with this one. I believe "You Received Mail" is a remake (though slightly different and also a very enjoyable movie.) In this movie. For a relaxing evening with a movie you do not need to be disappointed if your kids or anyone is walking in your look, get this, or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
