Undesirable story ........ voted ten against all ages for my age and sex ... not all that much comedy (compared to an almost wet film myself) although funny enough. Not a fan of musical at all that probably a little too much for me, but to make you take a drink or soda without missing anything significant. Perhaps a fifty version of Harry when he met sally? Ahab has no really but if it's in ten yourself as it is to me you will love this movie. Really it just leaves you with a warm gentle feeling, reminding you of what romance could and should be like, something to shoot for. My summary describes it best in very few words ..... well
