I saw this as a child in the late eighties and I must say, Galaxy Express is one of those films that stick to your imagination for a long time. If you have never understood the appeal of anime, discover this movie can be your golden ticket to Otaku-town. The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's blade runner. The cell animation, while somewhat traditional, possesses a vivid style that explosively illustrates Leung Matsumoto's talent for character design and visual tale. This is one of the unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely embraced 'family entertainment' status and stand as a classic of movies on its own theme. <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
