Ed Harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and including the formidable Sean Connery. The movie, which is more than a little witnesses, comes alive only at the scenes when Harris is the lawyer's interest to another convicted. It is breathtaking, a master class of artistic control. <br /> <br /> Other members are cast all adept and Connery is serious, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself packs no boxes. The plot depends largely on the fact that a black prisoner still be beaten and forced by white police officers. This is the engine that leads the story, right or wrong, and make one feel a tired cheating suffer at the end. <br /> Still, worth seeing Harris in action.
