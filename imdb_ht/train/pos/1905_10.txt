Quite simply the fenniest and shiniest movie-comedy ever ... it's certain about my self-ten personal list. This one also gets a ten-strong vote vote. Millionaire Millionaire, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged child who refuses to take the mature path to life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. He refused to leave the bottle too. One day she and her personal chapman, Hobson (Gielgud), went to Goodman's Bergdorf shopping and ran into little larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry add electricity to the rest of the movie. There are set pieces hilarious aplenty. In one of these scenes, Arthur (drinking at most of the story) hit the door to the wrong apartment and received a broken ear break into a 'mermaid' person ("my husband has a gun !!!!) Performances by everyone involved should hardly be noted that: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Grandmother's love-again-without mercy, Arthur Jan Gielgud almost robbed the entire show with his acidic fist (He took home Oscar for one such a), and Christopher Cross give the Main Theme Song (Oscar winner "Best That You Can Do"). It's a shame Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
