"A Girl's Madness" is a sort of half-comedian, half-mockumentary look at the photo movement business in the mid-1910. We get a glimpse into the life of an early film studio, where we experience assembly in a series, running through a scene, touching to worship movie fans, even lunch of the commissioner. We are also aware of the fact that little known cinemas - for example, did you know that "often," movie actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they work "? This film in essence is Kenneth Driscoll's star star discovery and romance in a burning young starlet who she discovered while shooting sideways in the country. I believe that my 30-minute version was off, including on the same tap with Cecil B. De Mille in the "Cheat." It's a very credible movie - an easy look and a great throw of extras. As a bonus it includes some of the best-illustrated captions I've ever seen accompanying a silent film.
