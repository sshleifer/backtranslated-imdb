Many people commented that this film was nowhere near as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not - for you. However, how does your child react to it? Well, I liked reading more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney cinema in the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids. (For example - Bambi's mom is getting shot.) This movie was really great for my girlfriend sensitive who loves humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobby on what would be the Disney-based standard of the past - skip this movie. <br /> If you have a sweet or soft-hearted boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your toddler. This movie is great as a sleeping movie for heart dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that wants my kid & do not have to impress the parents all the time.
