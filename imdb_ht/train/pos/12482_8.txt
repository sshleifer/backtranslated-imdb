I read nothing but good about this movie and finally there was a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and much more. This is a proper way to support the movie should be. I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. The spooky sounding note was perfect for putting a black atmosphere. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.It was very easy to follow and I understood unlike some movies that are way too complicated. Special effects were pretty good.I would like to see more horror movies like this one.This is unlikely one of my favorite. A real storm and lightning storms have put a nice atmosphere for this movie .Other then that it has all the elements a good movie movie horror needs. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good awesome movie that pulls no punches. I'll add it to my collection .The DVD contains some interesting features.
