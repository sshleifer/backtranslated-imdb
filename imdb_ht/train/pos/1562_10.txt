Show Green Arrow favorites (featuring this season), Aquaman (featured in Season 5), "Impulse" (Season 4), and Cyborg (Season 5) all come together, along with Clark, to stop one of Lex Evil plans in this epic mid-season episode. Through its sophisticated technology, Green Arrow learns that Lex Luthor builds labs around the world that keep people induced by the meteorite kryptonite and those who have the ability to run tests on.
