This film was described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama describing common threads of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the Dark Circuit Director (Iran's favorite movie). The rest of the girls and the gender between them and soldiers were both completely credible (as if it was a documentary) and completely hilarious. The movie matches the current and consequences was amazing. He added a lot of realism like Kenny Australia, of course a very different movie. Performances from all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? they were very credible. She was very moved to see the passion, deception, and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls carry a chador are different with their own daughter should go see this movie ?? it will be a real eye-box. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represent the actual paradigm. They started out with official standards official political response to all the pleas of girls. As the film progresses, it has found it more and more difficult to maintain this position. And that looks like all therents break out of wild celebrations, everyone keeps in it, and the ridicule of the current policy is evident in one and all. <br /> It was a very unexplored and unexpected ending, and gave the film a really nice mix of emotion, frivolity, drama and social comment. Even though it's adult movies, I think mature kids from about seven winters really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is able to produce films of these types by the likes of Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints have directors to be very resourceful. Australian (and other) movie makers could take a leaf out of the books.
