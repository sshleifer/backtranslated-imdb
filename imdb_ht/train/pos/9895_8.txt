A bunch of high school students play a cruel joke on Nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) who left him incredibly definite. Five years after the gang returns to school now crumbling and abandoning high school for a reunion. Of course, a mad Marty and retaliation show up dressing in a jester's costume precisely a grisly revenge on his fears. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clich√©s that make these 80s in slice'n'dice counties counties flies very fun cheesy: false jump crises, prowling Steadican shots, a bad storm, a Groovy insanely hard rock band, a beautiful smattering of brunette free nudity, a totally ridiculous "what the hell?" Supernatural Climax, make-up makeup f / x, and one of those lover lovely "it's all just a terrible dream" fo-out non-theme. In addition, the elaborate killers killed elaborate killers of luxury goods: En Gory includes a man's belly in exploding after drinking beer beer, a lady taking an acid bath, being a guy being crushed under a large tractor, and two people are getting electrocuted while in the middle of wild fascinating sex. Thirtyish British cult supporting Siren Caroline Munro is hilariously miscast as an American teenager in the third third of the flick. Throw at all to give solid performances, and especially stand-out work from Carmine Iannaccone as smartaleck leader Poll Pollack, Billy Hartman as wishing to change Frank Frank, and Donna Yeager as Stella's breath-mouth. Co-producer Dick Randall has a fun comedy as Manny Munro's Manny. Harry Manfredini's Moody, singing music without reproducing signal recycles from the "Friday 13th" notes. Alan slickman in the movie the trick. Well, fun trashy.
