A best-selling book about honoring the honor of Jordan is removed by its publishers after the acquisition of the story being manufactured; associated with other accusations of her past authors as a coworker. A few years later, he resurfes, conscious that he has taken a certain amount of dramatic license, but wants to cooperate with a film-maker to prove the substance of his allegations. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, a person of behavior on one made no sense unless it says, indeed, who looks incredible to say anything that is not amazingly dramatic, but prove to be best and most often, verified fake. It's almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri was hoping to find by appearing in this film: vindication? celebrity? - All it does is project a certain image in itself as a deeply damaged person, and even that can not be taken into nominal value. Director Anna Broinowski appears increasingly on camera as his film progresses, and increasingly exasperated boots; but it is ultimately rewarded with a remarkable, although scary and disturbing, storytelling - and one of those films that reminds us of a quite strange world it is we live in.
