Ettore Scola, one of the finest directors and grand-leaders of the world, is not yet available on DVD ... (read in summer 2001 now ....) Mystery to launch the idea. <br /> <br /> This classic grand back in the theater at my home-city thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see her again on the big screen after all the years of her watch, on a video-tape ... it's a true gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid a critique but try to prove one point: I took a hesitant little brother and I saw this film. He has never seen the movie before and "does not like those Italian Oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder. Even during the end-title the theater remains completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is truly special. A wonder of revision. With a great loss if you have not seen it (yet) ...
