Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come by, the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it. (When home video started, there were three versions of LEAST and parts missing.) All you have it is true. There is no defending it, and no living without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at, and the output values ​​are very good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie season. But there is no question .. whole Santa Vs. Satan angle is so jerk STRANGE he has made the movie a hit at the time with a fake bitch a home video really got underway. How good / bad / strange / is it? I've only seen the TRAILER as a kid, and remember it for almost 30 years .. including Murray on the top of her. I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and not could believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where Santa vs.Satan .. Add to it things like Santa asks for the Virgin Mary's blessing before putting on the eve of Christmas, the kids want to take it and do it His SLAVE .. and an international kiddie sweat shop .. and it probably comes close to a lot of childhood dreams there in the 60's .. Like others here, I look at the thing every season is happening right now. (My version of choice is the Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it, the movie is a relegated masterpiece with a total amount (along with Brianiac, by the way ..) It never failed to make me laugh. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS MARTIANS. Part of it can always make you cringe or just crawl you out. (How many parents do you know go out for Christmas Eve cocktails? "If you get bored, just go down and play the piano." DANG ...) Freak, boring, disturbing, funny, kids, strange .. hey, what's more you maybe?
