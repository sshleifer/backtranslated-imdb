Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the artificial "artful" objects. Daily articles such as boxes, boxes, metal containers, etc. - the most items we see as the best utilitarian and postponed as they were completely worthy aesthetics - are rather converted into wonderful art objects by Burtynsky's camera . It achieves this result by focusing on the renewable colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for people sensitive enough to spot them, that is. Even the compact trash pile can become objects of beauty when viewed from Burtynsky's lens (but did not we already know that the "mi-E"?). It is particularly interested in photo photographs such as mines and spaces where Man has already made invasions of nature - which can explain why at times even those in his picture (ie the workers in the places), and uniform clothes and Robotics movements, become part of the industrial landscape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Indeed, the director of Jennifer Baichwal and filmmaker Peter Mettler captures the essence of the original photo of the purely cinematic theme, as their own record Burtynsky camera and his assistant runs photo shoots at a factory in China, a fund in Bangladesh, and the construction site in the massive Three River Gorge Dam project in China. With cameras-fluid work, filmmakers match point-to-point beauty in Burtynsky's image. In fact, the film opens with a stunning, swit-u-minute shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similar dresses go far in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. Well when Burtynsky gets around the articuler "terms" of his work, which, quite frankly, sounds confused, contradictory and decidedly half to cook at best. But it is such a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting images and shapes, that "professional landscapes" are the most reasonable. In the case of Burtynsky, maybe a picture really worth a thousand words.
