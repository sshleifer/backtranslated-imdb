This is a really fun movie. One of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the draw becomes more and more braided; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in his hey-day), Kevin Klein, Elizabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All these well-known actors act as if they are soap opera stars / producers. If you've ever looked at a soap opera and thought, "How did the world come up with this idea?", You'll love this movie. I saw it several times; and every time I look it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize just how well-acting it really is. Do not expect Oscar quality. This is a fun movie entertainment, by some artsy attempts to find the "man's man's interior", etc. Sit back, relax, and laugh.
