For the first time, I watched the movie when I was 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they have to have anyway because since watching this movie I tried to learn as much about the real Buford Pusser Sheriff as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me thrill and Buford Pusser was a true hero, I only wanted to have lived today and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family went to these horrors and pains. My heart goes out to them. So, from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and in the 3-part Tall movie cinema markets and the actors who described him, please do not negatively about these movies and actors, they were just trying We know what a wonderful man Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all young people who have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the walk walk movies and learn more about it.
