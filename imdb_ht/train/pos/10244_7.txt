I would not call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, she calls into question the safety of carrying beings in an era of us. But it really opened my eyes when I saw the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mas, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. Paraphrase that: an actor gives, the "Cheers" woman, "Evening show" host, the most trustworthy In the news, a famous chef, the prince "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the three Amigos and CNN guy. <br /> But I guess I should not focus solely on the cast. I thought that this film had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it's escapism, but the kind of perception. I would actually say that John Goodman makes Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work at "Monsters Inc". Worth to see.
