For quite a long time in my life, I either did not like this movie, or I loved this movie, but not as much as much. I watched it recently (in a sleepover, oddly enough) and I loved it much more than I did since I was under 6 or something. I now appreciate it more, as I do with a few other Disney classic that I've watched recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or however you spell it). <br /> I now greatly appreciate the animation, the clever "Disney" plot turns, the humor from the mice, the emotions expressed and the draw. The animation is very well done, often it looks to you wherever the other characters, watching them. The animation also shows the styles of origin, including the city (which shows twice a time). Disney changed this out of the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, cleverly drawn draw draws, such as the mouse to make clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney movie very much if they are not the same as the original story , but with this I do not bother to harness. I feel made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie. Even I do not think Disney changed the book in a great way to some of the films). <br /> You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her cute little girl and stepisters. He goes to a ball with the help of his fairy goddess and loses a glass slipper ... This is a great movie to be watched with others. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-)). <br /> I recommend this to those who love Disney at least a little, those who love fairy tales and those who love mouse. Enjoy! :-)
