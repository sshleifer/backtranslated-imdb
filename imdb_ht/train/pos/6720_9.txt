Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary draws the story of surfing and tracking three other well-defined and acclaimed films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, Its Endless Endless Track II by Bruce Brown Dana, and Stage of Liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> While footage of navigation is spectacular, I value the most historical film-maker's perspective. It takes us back to the origins of the sport almost a hundred years ago, and shows how it has evolved into its present form. This includes extensive interviews and leading personalities and performers, how surfboard designs have changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most frequented by the world-class surfer, with an incredible adrenaline sporting rush. The athletes stayed for several months at a time on the beaches, ranging from dawn to sunset, sitting on rudimentary bunks, eating for food, and returning to the board the next day. What is a efofic way to spend your youthful day. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovers and promotes the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest strengthening of the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright issues can prevent Beach Beach's beach credit like Surf Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing and Encyclopedia magazines in browsing (which was known as a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the pioneers of the sports, family, and how the current generation benefits from the origins of the 1960s. One such story is how 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, considered the greatest surfer today, bonded to an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his only mother, who he married before becoming father step-it. <br /> <br /> A musical stroke of contemporary music from all ages accompanying the story. Do I respect your appetite? Wonderful thing. Make a great ride.
