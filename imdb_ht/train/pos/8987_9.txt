I recently rented this doc, it was remembered to hear about it at IMDb.com and was intrigued by the quote. I knew very little about either of these bands, but I remember listening "Not If You Was The Last Junkie On Earth" by Warhols to Dandy Age and Enjoy It. That being said, this is my perspective on the doc: One thing I get incredible about this movie is no need to have any previous knowledge of one of these stripes. The director (Ondi Timoner) waste does not have time to engage the audience and familiarize them with people in this movie. I quickly came back to life both Anton and Courtney as well as their respective bands, the Brian Jonestown massacre and the Dandy Warhols. I think that is part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner like a master documentary. <br /> I also loved how the "story" of the band was said. Most of what you see is in the Travel Bands. Both bands start out playing small avenues and difficulties to make it into the recording industry. Throughout the movie, each group tries to stay unique and uncontrolled by the usual. However it is this that makes the same strips, and so the brilliant perspective on how two strips of a pen can go in different directions. <br /> I would basically recommend this to everyone who loves film in general. You do not have to have a particular love for documentaries, or either in the bands. An appreciation for music helps but the music itself takes a backseat of love / hatred relationship between Brian Jonestown and the Dandy Warhols.
