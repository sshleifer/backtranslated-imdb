To begin with, I liked g√∂ta channel 1, having a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the boat that always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is still acting the same guy at The Canal Channel 2 movie, but in my opinion my performance is not as funny as it was in the movie first, in fact you did not notice it much at all. Something that made me bad thoughts about this movie is the choice of ships, in this movie there are only boat ships, they are sure to be quick but these do not make waves like the great floating floors used in the first movie, I loved the old man the best and these new ships made one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the boat suddenly jumped out of it to evade the "big waves" of those small ships . Surely a less. You must accept that we are not living in the same same year as 1974. This film also has a bit more violence than the first one. Although the movie was great all at all. I just focused on some downside that I was disappointed in the rest of the movie being up to my expectations, so go see it! It's worth the money.
