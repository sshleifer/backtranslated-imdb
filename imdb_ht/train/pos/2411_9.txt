This film hit me as one of the most successful attempts ever to come up with possible answers for some of the nagging questions that broke up in recent scholars regarding the "Passion" (suffering and death in Christ) account of the New Testament. (What motivates Judas if money did not matter? What can bring the Sanhedrin to meet on a holy day? Why is Pilates Verses?) It is a movie for the serious Christian, thinking: fan of "Passion Christ the "will not doubt be disappointed by the lack of gor's spectacle and characteristic arch. As for myself, I find the portrait painted here - in the will of ordinary people so sacrificing common sense desires when their own self interests are at stake - far more realistic and deeply disturbing. (The disinterested, "just doing my job" to look at the face of the person who drives the nail first into the wrist of Christ is like refreshment as sometime in film.) The film does not claim any "authenticity" but the surroundings and costumes Always feel more "right" than many acclaimed efforts. It's a slow film but if you accept its self-imposed limit (it is, after all, the "Death" - not the life - "Christ"), finally a very rewarding one.
