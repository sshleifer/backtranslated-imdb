No Strings Highlight emphasizes Carlos Mencia's features that make us both laugh and think. Not only does it spell fun in racial issues (as many people deny claims), but it also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants from the country ... what women mean when they say they want treated equally ... why Americans are more crazier than Arab terrorists ... why no one prays for the Pope - and what he hopes he is doing in the sky ... a theory about Easter (aka great ups of Jesus Day) tradition began ... look at the film The Passion of Christ - with his sub-sequence argument with a woman about whether he was affected by Jesus ... how society should treat physically disabled .. and even if you can say a joke or not. <br /> Also, it never ceases to remind us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to speak the truth, say what we think, and do not be afraid if others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
