Good: Participate in cinemas firefights, great presentations, cars are actually fun driving, fairly appealing multiplayer, loyal to the movie, and the list goes on. Bad: The main mission is a bit short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third-person third person (not necessarily a spy-game) is. Great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission, and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer. The hype this game was, lived up to, and I personally think you should buy it, and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one. Burden of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound of this game is a successful rip-roaring out of some previous bond games, and shooting a gun, really feels like you're shooting a gun. It links to the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you have done it, with some multiplayer who can compete with the standards of the James Bond "Nightfire" game for gamecube.
