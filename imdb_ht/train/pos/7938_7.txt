Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a crap charge of children who look nothing like one of them. Basically, Rob and Josie have a wedding war on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation. They each come home to find that their children are already aware of their marriage due to non-fictional journals. They, Rob and Josie, move both of them to eight children in one or the other house. <br /> <br /> Rob build furniture, I think, that is close enough to work the Frankfurter (Patrick Duffy) The very step step by step gives eternal prospects. <br /> <br /> Josie is some sort of cookie queen, though she does not seem to make any of the cookies. It is not enough for Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) to work hairdressers to guarantee that it looks, but hilariously fairly good for atrocities. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one's last one's name, or so one supposed to be serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together. <br /> <br /> Whatever, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think that should be called Andrew 'younger Andrew'. <br /> There are a lot of placement products, particularly for soups (which are disgusting) and Listerine pocket pockets. There are also some stupid, nonsense moments. It's also not a big movie to encourage families happy. But hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review of 'step by step ... on some really bad drugs.' Watch it for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes! There are some pretty nice! Each vaccine.
