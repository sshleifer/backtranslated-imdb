Director Sam Fuller has something of a kind of culture, particularly in Europe. But the bulk of his films is much more than forgettable. He made one really movie movie "Pickup on South Street". Was done very early in his career, movies followed were largely inferior. <br /> In the first of the latest frame, "Pickup" works on all levels. It filmed with impeccable fluid, boasting fine fine overalls. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top performance, peak performance. Widmark, who had no stranger to play bandits, while really meant to the core, still managed to reveal just the slightest humanity that made his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters's character fall for him, all the more credible. <br /> <Fuller holds no punches in this movie really hard. There is a scene that Jean Peters finds roughed up by Widmark. It's really shocking to its reality. This is not a case of cartridge carefully choreograph. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many movie noir in this period remains a great example of the genre.
