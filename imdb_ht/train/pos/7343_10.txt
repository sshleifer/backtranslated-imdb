Why this movie has all but disappeared from obscures is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the sole and best witch films. Violent violence, fresh character designs, and good rhythms, make one of the best imaginations around. It is certainly the greatest animated film aimed at a more adult hearing that I've ever seen. This is not the same as Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It is quite a departure for Bakshi, and in my opinion my best work. I hope this film gets the recognition he deserves.
