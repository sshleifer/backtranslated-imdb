This film is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history set in the late Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate loses a strong fight against the loyalist, who wanted the Emperor back on the throne to rule Japan. Really, I read a lot of stories to get all the background. Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) provides a superb performance as Izo Okada, one of the Hitokiri's four (Human Thousands) in the Bakumatsu. It's a simple samurai that collects its wealth. In order to have a good life it becomes a delay in Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke from the Doom of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who allows her band of Hitokiri to assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-Western politicians in order to achieve its political goals. Okada Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he had money to go and drink and spend at his whore. Kill the Okada to get more and more brutal in the movie and proud to have a reputation based on scary wherever he goes. <br /> It's a splendid portrait of the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in politics and is really naive to realize what's going on. First after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence) he changed his ideas and views on life. But too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Okada Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff provide a brilliant performance. Each actor gets up to the roles. The sword sword is a very unique and fast ... probably faster than several movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> Check it out if you have the chance !!!
