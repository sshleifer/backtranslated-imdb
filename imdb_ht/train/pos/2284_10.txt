This is a lot of chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. I'm very impressed by the film, not only for the sketch and superb act, but was like a unique film made. Most movies involving a spy or war are full of a British speaking brick or a warrior battle, but not this. This is not about this kind of war, it's about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. When the war ends, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his real heroic position must be a secret government. Going back to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi dogs, providing for exciting conflicts, both internal and external. Nolte more than pull the role, and adapt the plot well for what it is asking.
