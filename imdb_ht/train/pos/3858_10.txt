Director of US Verhoeven's Director Paul is kind of varied, but most of the films he has made in his native land are indisputable owners. This is the story of writers (and bi-sexual) writers who move in with a beautiful and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that she is just interested in meeting the handsome lover of the woman. In the meantime, the writer is plagued with unusual visions - at first to look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but it soon begins to realize that he is actually having some kind of preference. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. I like films that make you think of something, but then you realize that they are on something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half, and a casual-religious surrealist legend during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemy, not for children or people going to church every Sunday. Great movie by the future director Jan Bont. Tr√® Reommended!
