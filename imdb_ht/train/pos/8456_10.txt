I watched almost all the animated Gundam / Mechs that were shown in the United States and that's not far from having the best story. The road twists its trail and turns there u riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. The series followed a group of five 15-year-old boys who were trained in state pilots in the art art costumes known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful stress known as Oz. As things begin to warm up between OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old people will disappear. Old conflicts will end with new ones going up. To find the Gundam pilot peace must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to the whole battle. But how far are those who want to go to find their goals. I recommend this anime for anyone looking for a show that has a deep scheme.
