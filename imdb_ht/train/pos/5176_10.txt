A must see movie for anyone ever going to camp, or wanted. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It's funny, it's compassion it makes you want to look more on the once credit characters to start in roles. If you have not seen this movie .. what are you doing? get on your butt and run the video store. Make a great summer :)
