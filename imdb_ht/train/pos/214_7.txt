An old vaudeville team at Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known, but they broke up to hate each other. Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a special TV ... but find out they always hate each other. The ninth / agent of Willy (Richard Benjamin) is trying to get them to work together. A great hit on his day and he was George Burns an Oscar for best supporting actors. I (a bit) loved it. It was written by Neil Simon so it does not stop one-Materio. Some of it was funny but the jokes of scenarios Willy and Al were NOT. Also I never loved Matthieu. I never thought he was a good actor and something about it just rubbing me the wrong way. Also her character here so your chandik becomes ill in her fast. All that was on this site was fun. Burns is just great featuring on one-materio with ease and even Matatu was good to match it. Verbal struggles are the best sequences of the movie. Also Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew is trying to get two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. This began his career in a great way and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So this is a good thing. Just good - not great. Matthau's character really does so hard for love. I give it a 7.
