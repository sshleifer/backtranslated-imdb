EA has shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's. The graphics in the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. I got this game April 2007 (two years after release), and I'm always impressed with the gameplay. It's a shame that EA will not make 007 games. <br /> I give this 10/10 game for the levels it has, especially the "Consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone 13 years old and over. The only thing I did not like in the game is the level of Russian chips, it was too much pressure. On the whole I like the game a lot!
