Everyone we meet influences our thinking, modifies our way, a little bit of this person rubs off over us. The "Eighth Day" takes up this theme (Compare "Rainmaker"). In this film Harry (Daniel Auteuil) a businessman expert of lavatory psychology meets up with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a Down Syndrome Child on the Run. Performances from both actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges relates to his theory about the creation of the world and the scene to close us to discover what God created on the eighth day. Some moments in the story are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges is completely uninhibited to demand a pair of expensive shoes and do not have enough money. It's kind of scene where you laugh in tears. I liked the scene of the Down Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery Escape in a bus and barrage accident park paris park. The most ridiculous of all the embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a horse-float on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver a rude greeting. But there are some gentle scenes as well, especially the impressive use of pre-ups in hand - but feeling the sun, wind and rain, but reaching up, but reaching out and clasping in love and friendship. This is the true movie that touches the heart. There are very few scenes where George proposed Nathalie, where Georges bowed Harry's head in his arms, where Georges kept calling for his beloved mother, where Georges taught Harry to laugh .. I felt there was a profound message of film in that the beautiful life - the presence of grass (Did you know that it weeps when you cut it?), the trees on top, the song of birds, the little insects - animals all the miracle nature. They all have to be enjoying if we are lying back (like Harry and Georges) look around us and listen to ...... A nice movie.
