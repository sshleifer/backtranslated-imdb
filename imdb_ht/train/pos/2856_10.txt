This is one of the best movies every time you see them. It is packed with many original and original ideas that you still get a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent movies (I did not see "unlucky monkeys" yet, but the others are as great) failure, luck and humanism play great roles. The cutting and assembly are inventive and artistic, without the film being an "art" picture, but a very fun. By comparing it to "Run, Lola, Run" you must keep in mind that "Dangan Ranna" has been doing some years before and has been shown on German TV as early as 1997 ... So it's more likely He has served as inspiration for Tom Tykwer's film, and is not the other way around. Complementing the other comments I must add that I love the act and the very end. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoyed or firefighter.
