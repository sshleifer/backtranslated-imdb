As others commented, I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert this list as one of the top 10 top of the year. What a gift. I then went out to buy it, just so I could loan it out. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum suspended his truck when he realized that someone (cage) is on his top cabin. When Cage comrades, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I'm afraid of you." Yoakum has pistol his pistol in Cage's face and "Does that look like I'm afraid?" Large humor after an exciting and temporary escape. There really was a sense of fun. The constant dance of "Welcome to Red Rock" signs elite a plain and a smile head smile. The music creates a hunting, unusual quality film at the reminiscent of "Twin Pics". Unlike "Twin Peaks", though, it does not spoil things by going too far in the foreign, which needs to "head" itself. <br /> I admit watching these credits 15-20 times. You see, the Yoakum was "miles thousands out of nowhere" (perfectly selected) to play as a bending freight train around down the desert floor. . and snow-capped hill in the distance. This was incredible, framing liquid. Further, I never saw a better unification of eyes and sounds on film. Also, it's totally fit the story.
