I kept this in a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was in awe of the absolute power of this film. It's a psychological effect on our brave soldiers who are entering the military with the hope that they will protect and serve our country as well as to be cared for by our government. The film features psychological changes that take place at boot camps as soldiers return to "land assassins" and put into the war with the effects after they return home. It also shows the effect that kills there on the human psyche. He paid homage to the Soldiers and never criticized the soldiers unlike other films, rather criticizing a system that is not prepared and not taking care of all physical and psychological needs of the vets returning. This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thought-provoking. It stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but not actually listening to them and helping to support a change in their healthy path and welfare care after the completion of the end . <br /> <br /> The Best Movie of the Festival So Far, **** / ****
