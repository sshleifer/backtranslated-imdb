I finally bought and added to my collection a copy of "People Show". I can not comment much more than what previous viewers have stated with the characters, draws and general quality of this movie without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameras, out-of-character appearance of many M-G-M stars is silent is worth the look and in itself. I really love the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and meets herself playing the main character in the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Be sure to read her mouth as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies but she's a thing of the "I do not think I love her!" Pete the corn, pop into the tape and be ready to return more than three quarters of a century to make history stories. Enjoy!
