Yes, this is one of my great music films that I grew up with with great artists like Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention petite and glorious voice at Kathryn Grayson. The music and dance are superb. I understand Frank had taken lessons at Kelly; and there Kelly dancing with Jerry mouse, which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who fell in love with Sinatra. It is one of Hollywood's greatest stars underrated. I've seen it again on A & E TV and as well it's in my old VCR tape. Never get tired of the old musicals. Whatever Happened to Hollywood ??
