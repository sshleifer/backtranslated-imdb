The first, this movie was a wild ride along the way. The story of the formation of soldiers, fighting with the superiors, and the end of the grouping together. From the very beginning to the very end. This one war drama is worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (at times beyond reason) and the horrors of those boot camps. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how actors interacted were quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the scenario, from Tigerland camp, and even at the end to help her. Innovative free but the filming added a certain flavor or taste to the movie. Constant move, constant action, and just constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> Throughout the movie, it was increasingly realistic. There are some points in the film (the particular sex scene) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that would not have been without them. it was a very fearless movie, in and through. <br /> In my opinion, this is one of the best Colin Farrel movies (if not performance itself). Acting for each character was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
