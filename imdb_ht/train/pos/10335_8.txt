The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are some movies, in my opinion, these are perfect. This little B picture is a crafty story, well said. I was always intrigued by Alexander Knox, but they saw him many movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a little sad man who gets into a monster. He betrays everything with everyone without an ounce of remorse. The performance is one of the most chilling performance I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who have played Nazi or other wrongdoing in film have been nominally nominated for Oscars. I imagined that since this occurred during the war, the Academy felt like honoring a performance as this would have been like honorable. But Knox puts in the kind of performance - a man so bitter and burns by guilt that he thinks nothing of others has suffered. I still can not get on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Maybe Oscar deserves, but better in his career. There is nothing against him; I enjoyed it in these "slight" roles it often played. But here it proves it up to the work of heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you love human human stories, or stories about the fate of those who suffer from the Nazis, I highly recommend this little fine movie.
