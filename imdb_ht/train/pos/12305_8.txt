Not quite sure what to expect with this one, out of the positive review uniform I read. Turning out, I could never imagine this movie, because it was very close to the "bride and white" in being operative and dealing with the fantastic. This walk a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashioned ghost story. There is nothing to fear about it, not the theme, it's really a love story to deal with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who's a lot of problems with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the cute ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with wildlife outdoors Kung Fu, and a journey of hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rates along the way. I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are very fun, great visual, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel in this movie too. Very recommended.
