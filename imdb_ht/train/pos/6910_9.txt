Paul was totally torn off by an essential person who made Dave. It's the same story, not as funny though. <br /> <br /> Paul-related to me this morning on the scene was sammy davis new song in the national of parade. He arrived in Brazil after a flight from Vegas, three aircraft, car ride through the series, etc. He was defeated. He could hardly stand, had to use a stick. He lived in a trailer on the size of my toilet. <br /> <br /> she did not know she could do it. Then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras, paying 7 bucks. he came to life and shot this scene for two hours. It was nice, then almost dropped. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great guy, though very liberal. a real talent.
