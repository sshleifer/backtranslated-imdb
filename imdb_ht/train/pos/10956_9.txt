For those who think it is humorously strictly restrained and immature humor, you are in fact the one mindless one. While the show includes parts of her potty joke she also has a lot of satirical material and pokes the fun of social issues, racial barriers, stereotypes, stereotypes etc. You just need it to some of her material a bit more to get it. <br /> <br /> What I liked is not everything is a punchline. For those who await a formulated joke like Friends (I LOVE FRIEND friends), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her most realistic humor. We do not walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said, which is in most comedies. Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this regard. <br /> So do not take it as stupid humor because it is so much more than that.
