The overall movie is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and better than the term Gubra in its history, its sentimental value. There are some scenes that make me touch. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) has done it to act very well. Brilliant. I can say that his actions are almost natural. <br /> However, the song 'Ne me quitte pas' by Nina Simone really "'menaikkan' i 'bulu' 'roma'". <br /> <I love this song. Both the song. "Do not Quit Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded this song. Beautiful. <br /> And greetings to Yasmin. Credit ends the movie makes me touch again. We can see how yasmin really appreciates its parents in a unique way .. <br /> I think the movie deserves the Grand Prix of International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.
