The medieval legend Fritz Lang continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924) .Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to rule his murderer, Siegfried.Li brother is too weak to bring the killer, Hagen, to justice. Kriemhild married Etzel, King in the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) .He gives birth to a child, and invites his brothers for a party.Etzel and other Huns should be cultured Hagen, but it is protected by his brothers.We see a great battle in life and death begins, and lay all over the fire.Eventually Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild. These cinemas cope with great themes, such as revenge and sovereign love. Finally we have seen some better Cinema was made in the subjects, but this was one of the early ones.
