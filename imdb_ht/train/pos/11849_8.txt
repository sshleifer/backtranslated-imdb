If only all the animation was great. This movie is classic because it is strong is of simple aspect: History and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personalized. I felt for all of the characters, and human relationships with animals in the movie are working perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D animation computer has not worked best in any other movie. This is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want to travel a classic hero. 8 of 10.
