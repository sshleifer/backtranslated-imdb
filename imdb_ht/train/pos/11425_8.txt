The story is about a growing girl in colonial Africa, but it is so much more than that. Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things. A longing for another, one in a different race, which can not be consummated. Even a look is prohibited. There are no words needed. The facial expressions say everything. It is the story of a black servant, Protected (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). The desires of each other are so strong that they torture one another because they can not be one to another. <br /> <br /> The little girl, France (Cecile Ducasse) is lonely and spends its full time with protested. It really can not see this dance. <br /> One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the colonial laziness. They can not even get strips for their own self. There is world about the end; they just do not know it anymore. Racist attitudes will be erased with their presence. <br /> I think I would like to visit Africa. It looks so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
