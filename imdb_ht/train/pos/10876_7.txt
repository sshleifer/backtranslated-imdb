I was really excited about seeing this movie. I thought ultimately Australia did a good movie .. but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher movie ever. I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald who came all the way to Australia to make a terrible movie. The act was awful (especially that Australian guys who were trying to speak in an American accent), and the plot was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this movie coming out, I thought that the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the film "movie" the movie Call 2), but I wanted to let it slip if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> AVAILABLE !!! MAJOR PROBLEMS !!! <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie ended. I was expecting a great surprise about who the killer was .. but the killer was not even human .. that turned this realistic slasher movie into a terrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. you'll probably be disappointed!
