This is an extremely entertaining and sometimes creepy anthology, that if a bit short of the screenwriting department, more than make up for the shortage of work to act, work place and overall garbage. The best episodes of this is the first and Denholm Elliot to play a tearful writer by a character of his novel in their work (a perfect example of acting pulling from this merchant simply); the third, and Christopher Lee as a very scared of his own daughter and the final episode and ending great Jon Pertwee's great estate as a starfish movie star man who has become more than just a new role on his latest project. Dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is brilliant and inspiring, both obviously relishing the opportunity to really cross it! Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly has not been helped by the fact that the waxing face of the woman has been obsessed with down to the local wax museum, is nothing but "beautiful" as we say they believe it is! Someone in shocking beauty needed and instead we were given a woman with a march in a tortoise. Minor quibbles around this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one of the catches when you can.
