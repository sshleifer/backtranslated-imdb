For a movie that's officially about sex and leather, it has no right to be as oddly sweet as it is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South of Momma would not leave her dating until she married, who moved to New York and ended up becoming pinpoint-successful at her age, driven by an outstanding performance from Gretchen Moll. The page can not properly reconcile the pictures that it takes (nobody is allowed to touch, it's all fun and respectful) and the pornographic trials and assumes the ill-effects that his image has around the world around him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> time. Rather like this movie, in fact. Filmed in both technicolor black and white and glorious, it's a nice way to spend a couple of hours.
