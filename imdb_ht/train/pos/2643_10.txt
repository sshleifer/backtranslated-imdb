I really can not say too much about the plot of the movie that has not previously been said. I have not seen the film in about 25 years with the memory of it never left me. I searched it everywhere. I did dig for it in the past, but came empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw it and I did not even make sure if I had the right movie name So I decided to do another research and I finally get this sight. I was fine. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com I would really appreciate it. And anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance it is well worth it.
