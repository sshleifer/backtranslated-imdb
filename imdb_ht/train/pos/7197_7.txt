There were several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role also played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but I was the best of all times still Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The series also has good performances of various actors such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal wicked ones like John Merton and Charles King, with a very good performance in Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, used to whip his sword and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
