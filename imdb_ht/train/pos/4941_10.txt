I believe a lot of people down the rated movie, PA because of lack of quality. But it does not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The finish is just a little too real to others, but the trip to the rich characters and long lists of supporters give is both thought to be induced and very fun. Even the excellent cinema provides the urban environment, the LED is also excellent and innovative. This is a 10 in my book, this movie will take you to the norm and hope Hollywood script will not. They took some risks and did some different things. I think it works well, I'm deliberately trying to avoid any direct reference to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
