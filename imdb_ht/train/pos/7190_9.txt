Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a set period set right after the birth of Mexico. The new count of gold is produced by the city to hold the solvent of the republic. However a gold gold, Don del Oro is vibrating up the Indians and robbing the gold for himself. Zorro and his band of people to rescue. Reed Hadley is a Zorro win and it cuts a superb figure as it enters a beautiful selection of rest (most of all were reused by later Zorro series as well as other series as well) .The story moves and it is nicely paired clear who real real guy is. There is one reason I've seen this most of any series I've seen, it's simply a great action movie movie. The only thing I can compare is the Mark of Zorro and Tyrone Power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period. Its super and highly recommended.
