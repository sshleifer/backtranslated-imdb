Linking history: another look first for me, and, again, this is one of the most famous Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, even though I realize how titled the unreasonable movie can be misleading for some ; I certainly advise the director of Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND MAIDEN (which, incidentally, is a classic piece by Schubert who is listening to the movie during the episode of Cushing Cushing) - a great deal more. Even if the device is linked to itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Their production value has come as highly respectable for Duffell's budget to work with. The latter enphishes the film with a great deal of style that is not so common with this type of film, and, honestly, he regrets the fact that he wants to distance himself from the genre (though more so such as not to be typecast rather than because he felt he was under it). Now in the individual stories themselves: <br /> <br /> "Killing method": The opening segment does not offer any real surprises, but make up for this, it's slowly suspense and the creepy climb Sometimes Tom Adams's 'friendly' look like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from the old DARK house [1932]; Also, he concludes with a satisfactory diabolic-type tide, and features an intense justice for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That's all we need from it, really. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks": for the second story we present in a romantic curiosity mood that is quite strange for this type of movie; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as parpeably dressed) in the role of two lovers lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after a long time, and having friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably in a fate that literally worse than death; An ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is well-done in view of limited resources, and the unacplicable Ackland's unacplicable - or unwillingness - to leave town a bit reminder of the aristocracy's home-trapped at the Bunuel Fog Fog (1962) . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Porter and Innocent at Defeat at Chloe Franks (which appeared to be Lee's daughter). Treatment of the film occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and highly refrigerated curtain. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as an adult-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt a familiar familiar to her face but she could not properly put my finger on it. And in reading his filmography, he revealed to me that he played one of the leads to the long-run stage adaptation of Agatha Christie in the "mousetrap" at the end of West London, which my brother and I was fortunate enough to keep while we are on holiday in the summer of 2002! Needless to say, we had no idea then that he once created such a delicate - and tasty - sheer sheer absolute, especially by virtue of its peculiar look and a devilish smile !! <br /> <br /> The "Cloak": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire story (which always manages many debunkers in the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones) that take in some wonderful digs cinema exploitation and, at one point, Christopher Lee himself; Jon Pertwee is wonderful as the Canadian horror star that becomes more than his negotiation for trying to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends her images nicely if her role is a bit subsidiary of the procedures; Geoffrey Bayldon (designed to look like Ernest Thesiger) also had a bit memorable original; The 'silent-cinema' style of the finish was a very funny one pulled on a audience, I suppose - and, while some of the humor comes as heavy-duty a 'VOLTTER VAMPIRE VIDEO (1967) or Theater of Blood (1973), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the movie on a high (and very strange note)! <br /> <br /> Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering I had no other version to compare with; The main culprit is some apparent print defects, but that's never embarrassing as to affect the movie's fun. As for the extras, start with the Audio Audio: Frankly, this is one of the finest chats on a genre movie that I can remember listening; Jonathan Rigby gets the butt and his opinion more than usual for a moderator but his efforts certainly allow director Peter Duffell touching on all aspects of the production (whereas with some other films, you're leaving instead waiting to be more!), and, like these, it's a very nice track that completes the main feature very nicely indeed. The film "A-Rated Horror Film" is a refreshing effort with Peter Duffell again in stage-center but this time has been backed up and valid, if all-too short, the contribution from producer Max J. Rosenberg and star Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film scores, reviews, bios and a poster / stills gallery that, again, are beautifully assembled (and their contemporary reviews were something of a gift - and one welcome one).
