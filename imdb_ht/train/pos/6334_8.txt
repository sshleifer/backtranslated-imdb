This movie has some very amazing things. First, it is based on a true story. That, in itself, is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same city at night in Nebraska in Nebraska. I wonder if the real city's name was locked in "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is a Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with Blains-something. It shows the most slowly moving tornadoes on the record at seeing the boys at home. On the other hand, the scene where the TV goes soft based in reality. Before Doppler radio and radio weather, we've been teaching that if you turn your TV into a particular channel (not on cable) and wired to just right, you might say if there was a tornado coming up. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. <br /> Since I know something about Midwest tornadoes, she made this movie fun for me. I love it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break-no way you could do it in with F5 by chaining yourself in a tap in a good home.
