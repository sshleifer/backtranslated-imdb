Forget neo and bourne and all these half-cooked make-up hero today. They only look 12 years old-please the wide audience of geeks who want their hero. Since they can not fix or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allows a bunch of fake with no beard and yet satisfying adolescents wanting to see something that looks very much like a movie flick. <br /> However, their "set-piece action" are just painful to watch and any girl can challenge their masculinity without question. This explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screen over the past few years. For the best (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, attach yourself ... there was no beard !!) <br /> I say it is the time a new hero has been up and they are ruled by an end. This "Largo Winch" film is far from perfect, and maybe too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley has released a very promising performance as an action-hero. And the sole one time he's fail is when MÃ©lanie Thierry cuts off her beard! I rest my case. <br /> I did not know it when I entered the theater room, but that would be the movie I was waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, can be a well-crafted and rooted film of B genre without blushing on its performance. In the meantime, all we were grinding about was either a monstrous pile of manure or something too restrictive to reach a wider audience ... In other words it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (i love Doberman, your idea) ... I believe "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be both popular and film-making quality. <br /> I left the theater very happy and hungry for more.
