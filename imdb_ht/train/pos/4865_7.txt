I could not wait to get my hand on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacking the quality itself in Fred & Ginger movies. The story would probably be best read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting are downright painful to look (best friend of the boy and the girl). Dance funhouse is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen was able to dance, but her boyfriend in this film. Have you ever tried to stand on one of those spinning disks in a funhouse? Imagine battling on one of high heels! It holds beautiful and Astaire and adds much to the overall quality of the picture. <br /> <br /> Several beautiful songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you can find it with Lip Lip Upper. /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I went back and re-looked at the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
