I liked this movie. I thought it would be easy to look, and easy to forget. I run out after watching this DVD purchase, obv not easy to forget! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, and the casting might not be more perfect. Each character has the moments, and I laugh hard at all this movie, comedy distribution was spot-on. <br /> <br />
