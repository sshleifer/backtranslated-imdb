This is the final episode we deserve. At the end of the last season, things left in a 'life go on' attitude, which was hardly wrapped up-this realistic deserve. While not a happy show, this series was still one that made you think (something rare on TV), and that's no exception. 'Is death justified by reason?' 'Are moral reflective in society, or are society-shaped by the morals that they choose by some of power?' 'What is a just death, and can it exist?' All these questions, and more, are pose by the writers of this weekly show, and this is the final thesis. Fine acting, great writing, wonderful camera-work, brilliant correction, clean direction. If you've seen the series and you miss this when it first runs, then get a hold on a copy somehow. If you never watch the series when it runs, then this will stand up on its own, but it can be hard to try and keep that with all the characters they are and what they are talking about in their varied fittings. For those of us who were hungry visitors in the series in the last two seasons, this is very satisfying look.
