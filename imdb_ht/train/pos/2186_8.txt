and what a combo. Two of the great star musicians star together in this musical music. He writes music, writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone who can not write either because his wife dies (actually she's just fat!). The best scene is the number of pawn shops where Bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets the instruments out of hock. Just wonderful. And this is a very rare role for legendary Broadway, Mary Martin, and it is quite good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again the manic pianist), Charles Lane, and Helen Bertram co-stars. And who knew Rathbone could be funny?
