I watch this movie once and can look it again, but Jamie Foxx is good at the movie, and I feel that they can use a 'less funny' character as Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scene for example in prison when confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny. David Morse again is a beautiful portrait of a cop. Its characteristic hard yet quiet features are perfect for its role. Again Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends up hard on Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this scenario in each movie. I personally love that quality in a movie, where actors end up in the same situation as a movie before, as of what they did in the Green Mile. In general, it was a very good movie.
