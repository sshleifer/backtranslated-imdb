This is not the best romantic comedy ever done, but it is certainly very nice and look. It's directed to an old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as the woman can not get on her husband's death. She has a sexy mature. But I can not tell so much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because it is, at best, undesirable. It may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough. However, I get to feel that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written and enough thought in depth. We do not know anything about them because minutes after the story gets thicker, and the writers do not tell us much further than what's going on. But this problem has been saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a sweet-as-a-daisy sweetheart, and Robert Downey Jr is so good that it melt the screen. Even her smile is infectious. And it is so happens that the big eyes of her eyes are perfect for the scene already with flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you love them in this way, why not give it a try. <br /> <br />
