Scarlet rains ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well taken. The film had a great story. I loved it! Ever since I watched that movie, I was stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when her father died and she was picking up all her music composition, and Apollonia was sitting on the stairs with his ear in her hand. Critics say a drama but I think its more in a romance. Murphy Brown also did a good job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. I'm so happy I saw this film. The Purple Rain Song, beautifully sung song, was so sincere. I called more than once.
