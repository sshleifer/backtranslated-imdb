One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic finish. The movie is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer says it this way, with a single expert. One of the children wants to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides his father's car and well, and sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way. <br /> <br /> Mafia by 'The rules, Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone who works in the mafia with a giant home, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but doing a wrong job, or doing something you "boss" does not want , and you are fired, and killed. <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he has not seen, and well, almost all his family died for his "wrong" son . This movie is really fun, you see how the Sullivan lives after being chased by the mafia, or as such. <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of sad, show us about revenge, these working rooms, almost everything you love. Hopefully the guy will read this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia to make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and the workers . <br /> <This movie receives: 10/10
