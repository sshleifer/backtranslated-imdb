This film has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer altogether. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur play Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford play the bad guy who sells weapons in the Indians, and you can hardly recognize him. It was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together with the next film made mostly by hand but put in another time. This movie starts out with Lincoln's murder and it also deals with an American war. Calamity Jane is in love with Bill Wild and Buffalo Bill have gotten married and now want to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I love her here.
