Several features of this movie immediately date it. The sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great progress has been accomplished in sound reproduction in the years following. Language of the dialogue is rather sick and unnatural with the acting always reminiscent of its transition to the stage techniques. Bette Davis still provides a strong performance throughout her film as she does in this early period of her successful career. I feel, however, that somehow the accent does not fit the facial expressions. I think it is the accent of blurring accents that are not true rings for me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to dig into human relationships in dramatic intensity that will please all movie-spectators. As in many of her character's role, Bette Davis can change from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of hated fire. Leslie Howard is well driven as the English remorse artist and a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice to a little waitress. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film of the young doctor to meet her true love in a busy street. They are traversed in the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and screams screaming at them. This scene is perhaps meant to be funny, but I find it quite ridiculous in this movie otherwise very serious. It is probably interpreted to send home with a smile on your face. After all as far as we can see (with hope for) it is a happy ending.
