Often Impact was generally better than the Enforcer in my opinion. He was built to be a big movie, but then I saw the wicked (s) and shamefully. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact was different than previous installments. The draw went a different direction from this movie, as Harry's room does not take as much of a time-around police approach. We also do not see the villain (s) until later, which means less time screen for them, which is best for all of us. <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Harry's room, enough to say. Pat Hingle was enjoyable as Chief Jannings, Harry's new boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, either way, he was not different. Michael Currie is decent as Lt Donnelly, annoying Harry's superior. I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Harry's friend Horace. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a popular lesbian around the city. Jack Thibeau was thoroughly cast as Kruger, a pervert. Now, for the really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime lover was typically miscast as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just awful like Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie would be much better if not for best writing and acting on some parts.
