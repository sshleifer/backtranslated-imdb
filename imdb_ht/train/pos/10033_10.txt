The movie Titanic makes it more then just a "night to remember." It rewrites a tragic story event that is constantly being talked about and will not be forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Could be / they will ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace as an epic chief. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The principal has no doubt had the biggest impact on the movie. A simple disaster movie (boring to look) converted into an incredible romance. Yes I'm not the kind of romance either, but this should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! All the amazing effects, in the music, are in the sublime act. <br /> <br /> The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything seems very real and live. The legend itself "TITANIC" has shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, also arrangements. The act was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are just the best of playing the role. No one could do better. They are partly why the movie is so great. <br /> I think it's not too talkative. The plot is simple, the act is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers who watch the movie will share tears, thanks to unfinished finishing imaginable that can never be forgotten. Well if you have not seen this movie miss you out on something stealing, and an idyllic movie for Hollywood. Can it be better? No. Not at all. The most moving movie of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (Do not be surprised if you cry too)
