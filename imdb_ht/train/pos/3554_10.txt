Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other while doing this movie and in the years. Bando asked Sinatra for some song lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset about the fact that he was cast as Nathan Detroit, when he wanted the party at Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in the production and did not want any one to be better than he was.He said Brando get lost, so get back to him Marlon caught fucks up the stage of the diner where Sinatra has eaten cheese so that he should keep eating and eating. In the later years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of his way .
