A new side of the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most cursor ideas most of Queen Victoria is that of women who ruled for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable of the title role as he gives audiences a different perspective. He presents Victoria to his youth, Ascension of the Throne, and Early Years. Victoria Blunt's both fresh and cramped in the movie. Its strongest scene is with Albert (Rupert Friends) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors find themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could have been a cast-away role. Even if this is not a story of dramatic arches and exists "acting" moment, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth watching. There are a few historical libraries that are taken by writing on screen, the movie tries to remain true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the time period. The design is set with the exceptional costumes. This film will be much appreciated by those who draw on history, drama, and blunt and other actors. Dear Recommended. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
