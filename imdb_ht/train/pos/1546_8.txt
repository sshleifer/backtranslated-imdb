I saw this movie once at or close in its release year 36 years ago (1969). Although I can now only remember bits in it, I long to see it again. The parts I remember, right or wrong, include Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual favors behind a closed truck to get military information from him. The music note was especially memorable and stirred in the league in going with the wind and I would like to hear it again. There are some commercial reasons or copyright reasons why this movie is not available. Anyone know why? I have doubts about it with a lack of quality or interest.
