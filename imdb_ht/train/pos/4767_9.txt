I do not see how this show is like the OC at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the OC centers around adolescents and parents are trying to get into life. North Shore is on a hotel staff that tries to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Secondly, the OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox do a show just like one of his other shows on the same network? I think this is a great show and good actor for the most part. He has a good storyline and draw. I love the events that happen and how people care for them and work them out. The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out. It was not predictable as most stories about most shows. <br /> I hope Fox keep it on the air.
