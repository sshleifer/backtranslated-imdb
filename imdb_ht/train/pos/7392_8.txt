I like this movie very much. She has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is beautiful universal, the story of the Prodigy son. The aspect I like the best however was way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story. As the father told the child the story of his wife's family in the wilderness in northern China, the element of water and bathing has become a nearly sacred ceremony. Water was so rare that a simple bath had a depth of depth and meaning. Overall the film was very effective. There were moments, however, when it went on "too" sweet ... bordering on cloying during the park recital scene. But in general, I highly recommend this movie.
