I really enjoy this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the act. Writing this was top-notch. James Arness is a great actor and has shown him here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy, but Fess Parker? <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who gave Santa Anna, a prosperous and complex person who brought Mexico at turbulent times. <br /> While some might think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, many of the tedium followed by a couple of hours of terrible horrors. <br /> What impresses me most about this movie is that it makes you think of a cause and how some people want to die for what they believe in. That day and age when nobody is meant For nothing, I find it worthwhile to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you can feel about the politics of the time.
