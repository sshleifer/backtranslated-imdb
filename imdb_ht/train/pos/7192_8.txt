If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or the overall action this is a must-see. Led by the Republic Ace team of William Witney and John English, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this set series! I will not do you with the draw (with concern? Less talk, more fighting); What's really important here is Hadley's Superintendent's interpretation of the character / s and the cascade work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can see the influence of this film on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro gets caught in the original version of Star The garbage compact warriors of one chapter, trapped on a temple chapel a'la temple of bankruptcy in another, make a transfer to horse-to-coach transfer and even run through a tunnel while the baddies hit on a large water tank and The flood tunnel behind him, exactly as Mola Ram makes Indy the temple of bankruptcy. Besides all this, the whipping action is great as Zorro disarms villains, swinging in security, etc. and trusting it. Most of the swordsmen work is just lame, except for one chapter, which features a terrific sword brawl in a choreographic cantilever by sword / legendary Ralph Faulkner legend, who makes a scarlet screen appearance like Rodriguez wrong. This was the first serial I've ever seen, in Matin√©e in the Jewel when I was a kid and I was hooked on them ever since. <br /> <br /> Legor Fighting Zorro delivers "Z" merchandise!
