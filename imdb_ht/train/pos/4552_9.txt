Daniel Lewis Day in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor. It is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well deserves Oscar for her and Brenda Fricker who plays his love mom. Hugh O'Conner is terrific as the Little Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great like the father. Worth looking for the outstanding performances.
