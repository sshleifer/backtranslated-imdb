Love Trap is a "must see" independent movie. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, solid, and creative. The writer pulls you into more and more of each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that each person can identify with. The movie allows me to reflect on my life and what I consider to be. The movie looks like love really is, no emotional action. I was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie. Presentation at all exceeds my expectations. I give the movie two thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
