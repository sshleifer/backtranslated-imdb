I simply never bargain in watching GRATISBIRD. My husband was an extra so I was involved in the beginning. Keeping in touch with Jon and helping out and promoting the movie both in movies and now released. Even to the extent of distributing promotional post on ferry channel crossings and various locations in France. FREEBIRD has been expressly written and directed with the perfect combination of exciting and severe casting choices. Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of Grouch. Great privileges to meet Jon and cast into the prime ministers in January. Anything else you want to do is just ask Jon, either email or phone, you know how to find me. Sue xx
