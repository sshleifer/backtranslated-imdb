First of all, I have to start this comment when saying I'm a big nightmare on Elm Street fans. I think it is the greatest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is Boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's death, which tried the last chapter back then, is a strange movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time screen. Some think it makes it less scary, which I agree. And that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a little better, whom he is, who he was, how he became the man to haunt our dreams. For some, it's a bad thing, it's best if we never know because it's scary does not know why evil is wrong. Obviously these people will not love Rob Zombie's rum in Halloween. Really enjoy this one, you must see things different. It's not about a strange guy hidden in the bush in your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you. This was the first one, and he was scared. As the years passed by, Freddy killed more and more people, and nobody could get rid of him for good. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's domain of horror. In addition to Freddy's past story, I really loved the film's atmosphere. No more kids in Springwood, only crazy grown-ups. The night scenes are all great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song called '' Awake Now '' designed by Goo Goo Doll. In my opinion, the final nightmare is a horrific prank and I can not believe it's so underrated. Maybe it misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has a lot of awesome moments as well as funny moments too, and a lot of cameos! Get yourself ready for something different and you can not be disappointed.
