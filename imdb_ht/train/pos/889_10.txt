This is one of the best films in Hong Kong (action) around it has a tight and interesting story as well as great battle scenes. This film Sammo has it all, Romance, Drama, excitement and a great hero too. It is only the martial arts movie that I have been interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the battles. Sammo fans- This is a must see (See also East Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragon Forever and the entrance to the Fat Dragon.
