This show was great, it was not just for kids I thought first, it is for the whole family. The first season was mainly on the father looking after two daughters and son, she sadly passed away in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I loaded them with the show as what would really happen in real life and I need to mention the Goodbye episode it was so well done, it must be so difficult for this movie, or would say that they were real real water in the eyes. I'm 24 year old man and this episode made me cry me as I know how they felt as my dad died when I was 13 years too just like Roy. <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 had great comedy in season 3 also had some of my favorites as Freaky Friday, Secret. <br /> I always thought the show was strong enough to go on, I was ashamed that it ended, it was one of the best not to have been the best family comedy show ever since Home Improvement and it could have been friends next. <br /> it should never have ended, but always like to watch them everyday.
