The Grudge is a rumor of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows he does not deal with anything new, so he does any smart man would do in his place: he forgot the logic and focus in giving a viewer a fun ride. Uses frequently known clicks associated with ghost stories but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. The nonlinear narrative is not only a gimmick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only goal in a horror movie is to scare the audience (similar to a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie in place with flying colors. I watched it in a theater with a hearing and it was fun to see viewers go wild on this one. It probably does not play as well in your living room.
