I've heard some things not too good about this movie and have probably seen the low score here in IMDb and that's why I've avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and touch movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised how I was affected by watching him. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perceptions of what will be about to change and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touches me in a very rare way for a movie, or any media for that matter. <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Whatever you've heard about it.
