This movie was hysterical. I do not laugh so hard in a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunt," but was supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening waiting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy strikes hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is warm and awesome. The whole audience that I screened and seemed to be enjoying the movie as much as I did.
