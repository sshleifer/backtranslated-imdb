I saw this movie after watching Paltrow's version. I found that one very good, and I thought this would not be as good ... but I was wrong: British version was far better and enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "enjoyable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strongly captures the best Knightley Austen. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who liked the Austen book, should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed some things, but still loyal to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> 2 cents!
