Li-li-hello! This is a really fun movie. Basically, at Girl Party, you have your fun-lovin ', independent, early 90's of New York Chick. Together with his party friend, he meets a mature Turkish merchant. It is a common in age history for those new people who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a facial slumber developing into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers that might feel like the only skills they could keep while laying with a nak to send good parts. <br /> <br /> At a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch her movies. There is subtle maneuvering that perfects his character. If you want to laugh well with a fun time, be sure to watch this movie. Repeat their look is a must.
