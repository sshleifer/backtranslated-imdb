You went and dug these holes. Hole just left crackling, making a movie so good. Disney has done it again. Shia LaBeouf should be nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Stanley Yelnats. He was almed to win Emmy all day for best actors in a comedy series (even Stevens). Hole is one of the best movies in 2003.
