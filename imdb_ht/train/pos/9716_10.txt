To love this movie at most you must be a) strongly in love (without a wedding) b) recognizing English humor that is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gag c) be fairly clever, because the author has give an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie, and only if you meet the requirements of "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the author's opinion. d) All enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you must admire creative, a little bit of melancholy and great personality and remarkable <br /> <br /> if you fulfill all the requirements you will likely rate this movie near 10 points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I never laugh halfway (!) As you watch this prince. And I even managed to cry while laughing at some moments (I still get tender, whenever good things happen Kirsten Dunst)
