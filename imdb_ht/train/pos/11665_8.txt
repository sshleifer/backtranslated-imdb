I would not know about this movie if not for Oscar's "surprise" nomination for Best Animated Feature Films. Fortunately, it happened that I could watch this little treasure animated. <br /> <br /> The story is about Brendan of the nephew's nephew of Abbot's imposing and overprotective city in Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, renowned illustrator of Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opened Brendan's eyes in the art of illustrating and entertaining the outside world. Along the way, Brendan was befriended white forest spris Aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal of the valuable meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> The "Secret of Kells" is unlike most of the animation released these days. It is a throwback of kind as illustrations are made in strong geometry lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbols. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid style used at the beginning of the sequel to "Kung Fu Panda." However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of miracle for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion section are unforgettable haunted. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this tranquil germ in a movie. It is a welcome rehearsal from the senseless bomb at current animate ticket like "Monsters vs Aliens" and the love. The sparse Celtic music score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the movie. OK, the story might be a bit deep and a bit uncomfortable. I would like to know more about the book that Brendan and Aiden were working on. But the clear star of this film is clearly amazing stylistic artistic, said to be based on the artwork of the real book of Kells.
