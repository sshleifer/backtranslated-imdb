"Chinese Ghost History" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I've ever seen. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing battles. I love especially the scene battle between Wu Ma and the tongue of the devil tree. Original movie and refreshing film and another Embalmer's fine refinement.
