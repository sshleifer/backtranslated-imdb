I first watch this movie when I was a kid and is the only time in my life that I can remember to put my hand on my face and the extreme horror eyes in a particular scene. I remember it again with a border with my friends friends and promptly bought it on videos that have so much hesitation I might add (to my surprise I found it online at the United States when it was done in England !) When I looked at her again my reaction and surprise me was almost the same, in absolute horror and fear and never had my heart beat too much. This is in my opinion the SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movie looks tame in comparison with a bit corrected and trap (crap), pardoning the pun. What amazing though is the power of this movie and the UNI when watching this and about twenty of my associates I never heard much screams, blocks as well! Even the sight of the video carries God's fears in one particular scene, and let me feel that I will never walk alone in the dark !!!!
