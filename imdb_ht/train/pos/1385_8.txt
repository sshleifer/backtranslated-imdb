I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in Paris. A very beautiful movie about three teenagers 15 years old, all of them just off the same psychological steps. Many of the scenes let us return to our adolescent age and our first feelings of sexual relationship. It is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the feelings of first sensual sentiment to the lesbianism girls, but even in this case it does not corrupt the story. You can sometimes get the movie a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. I funded young talented actresses, specifically mentioned with Florian and Marie, very compelling. There are many small details but this movie allows me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
