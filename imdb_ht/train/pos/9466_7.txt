Dan, the widow of three girls, has his own council column that will probably go to union. After his wife's death, he took time to raise his daughter. Having known that there is no romance at some time, nothing has prepared her to meet with Marie's radiant, in a local book store in a Rhode Island small town in the sea, where she goes to celebrate Thanksgiving and the rest of his great family. After sympathy to Marie at first sight, little prepare her when the gorgeous woman appears in the family compound. After all, it is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> It's clear from the start that Dan and Marie have been doing for each other, and although we feel what the result will be, we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, an author and grim writer on his own, gave us two excellent novels, "What to eat Gilber Rezen", and "An Ocean of Iowa", with the delightful indie, "Pieces of April, which read It's just a coincidence that both movies cope with family during Thanksgiving meetings. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche Mr. Carell, in fact, keep it the best ever. In many ways, it reminds us of Jack Lemmon, taking it into comedy and serious material. What can one say about Mrs. Binoche, an intelligent actress , with a bright presence in any movie, it's just a comedy, convincing us about her Marie. <br /> <br /> Jan Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, nothing to do .. They just serve as music assistant for Dane Cook decor, who sees a Mitch fee, fares far better because it recites more line pass and others. <br /> <br /> The "Real Life Teeth" is a delightful movie that will please everyone.
