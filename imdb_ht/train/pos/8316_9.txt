I watched this movie every chance I got, back in the sixties when it came out on cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which has fasced me (with Bill Clinton) ever since. I was still very young, and the movie made a great impression on me. It was nice to see a movie about other youngsters growing, trying to decide who they wanted, and making some bad choices as well as the ones that are good. I was dazzled by McKee's beauty lunette, the big dresses they eventually got to wear, and the snappy dialogue. As someone who has risen from a single mother, I could truly identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
