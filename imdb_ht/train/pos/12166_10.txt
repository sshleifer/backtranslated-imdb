A very unusual and compelling film. It's a very awkward and well-injured man who tries to navigate his life as a fund-to-door fundraiser / seller. The director was able to take a very indecent tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain accompanying life. There is a sequence in a test facility that really stands out and makes me laugh loudly that is not something I do as often as I should. One of the more memorable films I've seen in a long time. Do not leave my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein. Fantastic performances all around. Simple Line "I really appreciate it." is now iconic for me.
