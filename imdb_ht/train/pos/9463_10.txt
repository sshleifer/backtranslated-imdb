I loved "Teeth in real life". A wonderful travel-to-love story like You got Mail or while you were sleeping, but not ridiculous full of eye gags and bit jokes, and not so romantic it makes you want to throw. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular pointer columnist who can not seem to find things in his own life straightened out. Until one day, on a family gathering / tour, she meets and immediately connects with Marie (still pretty Juliette Binoche's) a radiant sample of a woman who seems to be framing a dangerous filters listening back to the starlets of classic movies. Chemistry reaches a cup of tea and muffins, but Marie must cut off for a previous commitment, and be part way. <br /> <br /> Later we treat Tight-knit teeth, fun-loving families that not only have freeze together, but also enjoy using the clever and sweet dorky teeth as the butt of many undergraduate jokes. What I liked was that although the family's features could be seen as obnoxious in some, I thought it was a big portrayal of a large non-business venture of parody or great exaggeration. Family Burns is simply a closed group, dear people who are really interested in the best of Dan. There are awkward moments of relatives. The family is natural, but never means-mock or gossip; original, but never strange. <br /> Then Dan fell in love with his brother's girlfriend and brought him to the rally family. And so start a roller-coaster in mockery to see and comedy love-budding. <br /> I could go on but I just thought this movie was simply scary. It's not particularly "hip" or "smart", never too dirty and obsessed with humor or biting humor as much of their comedy in modern cinema. There is a nice balance of visual storytelling and funny-but-real dialogue. In fact, early in the movie, the initial spark of love begins with capricious discussions in a Hollywood-style classic conversation where the characters say what they are thinking loudly. <br /> So I was probably pick up and repeating myself, but I highly recommend "Teeth in real life". It's a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary-eyed. Full and fun and magical love, "teeth in real life" will not disappoint. <br /> =================== 3.5 from 4 stars Grade: A
