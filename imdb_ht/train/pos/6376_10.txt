If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and imagination - without the need to break through singing every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie, and I must admit that I laughed many times throughout the movie. There is no sappy song to get in the way of a nice story telling, and all the characters are lovable and identified in their own right. This should go down as one of Disney's "classics" because of its beautiful illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!
