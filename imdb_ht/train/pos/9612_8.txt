The good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of little things in life that would greatly affect the life of another person without you ever knowing. It's a tiny world and this little movie shows us. The bad thing: There are too many characters and difficult to say that the main character is but still a great movie. <br /> <It's a great movie and many people comparing it to Magnolia that I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Not Rated --- I miss her PG-13 for short violence, some languages, and sexual orientation.
