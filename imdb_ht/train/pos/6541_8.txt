As an elder among my 40s, I am not even close to any of the key features "Nancy Drew", but I was amazed by the movie afternoons; So I could say, the fear of sixty silver-haired women came down the row from me. The older man who left the theater just before me especially praised the 20-ma movie girl Usher (who said he would watch the movie in the evening before and liked it). The point, however: In the row just before me, there were nine - counties, nine - ten - year - old girls lined with each other, past popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling in their Preview. <br /> Once the movie started, they immediately left to look .... <br /> <br /> ... and did not much as peep until the closed credit began to roll . <br /> This is not a perfect movie; She does not quite pay her high school subplot, she's not quite confident enough in her own tone, and her thugs are just a hair too far toward critical inept at times. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the scheme hangs along fairly well, and it breaks deftly between the sins of excessive cheese and excessive upgrades. Last but not least, Emma Roberts brings the film and starvation starry - superb superb Josh Flitter despite, this is Roberts' film, and pulled it well. Nancy Drew is a lot of direct ancestors of the Veronica Mas Kristen Bell, and the film is also a linear line of early and condemned "Candleshoe" Jodie Foster. <br /> In the market today, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewers' intelligence. As such, it will not taste everyone - but for what it is, it is its pure film in decades.
