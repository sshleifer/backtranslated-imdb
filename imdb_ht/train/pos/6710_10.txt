Sabrina teen wizard was one of my favorite T.V shows in life: I used to look back into episodes back every day when I got home from school. So far I think I've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect girl / witch girl with normal teenage problems that we can all relate to. It's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the party very well as Sabrina's aunt. Zelda, the smart scientist, and the Hilda Crazy, one wacky to make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Even though I must agree that college years are not as good as high school years, but that does not mean they were not always good. I think the ending was awesome although it was not what I was expecting, it made sense and I loved it anyways. :)
