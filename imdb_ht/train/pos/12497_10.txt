If you have not already seen this movie in Mary-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is: "What are you waiting for?". This is yet another filmy and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and dear! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breath-taking (landscape-wise)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main landscape here anyway! Does any true fan want to read any other way? Of course not! Anyway; It's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not already seen it then you just have now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise that you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
