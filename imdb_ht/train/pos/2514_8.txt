I voted 8 for this movie because of minor minor minors. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun to say at least. The shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) took a little too much of her "Mani Matrix" in her. It seems like the enemies just stand there ... waiting to get the bullet. However, this movie touches and still makes me cry. It has a lot of GREAT humor in it so it makes me laugh as well. Gackt is a superb actor I must say .. it shows many emotions. This was Hyde's first time acting and was doing okay. The role fits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. All the cast is what I might say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT DO IT! YOU WILL REGRET IT!
