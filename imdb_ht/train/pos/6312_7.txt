Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell to his first director, "Confessions of a Harmful Mind," they stared in this film. George Clooney has also been involved with this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, showing them really believing in this project. In this potential also looks like a fine and fun project, that's the same line and film-remade as "eleven in the Ocean" and "The Italian Job" but somehow this movie is only successful halve, or at least it's not as good as it could. <br /> <br /> The film of its characters all played by some well-known amateur but a shame is that the characters do not really give enough room to develop. Even though the potentials could be fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters that are mildly entertained because mostly in some of the more original sequences in the movie. The fact that they played does not change much of this, though they prevent the characters from ever becoming a complete closure or maybe even annoying, or something like this all. <br /> It's due to the writing that the characters are not used at all their potential. I can only assume that the original Italian movie "I Soliti Ignore" works out better than this movie does. The film depended too much on its simple history and predictable ways of telling stories. But the movie is simply a very fun to look perhaps because of this simplicity too. It's a little harmless little movie, in which you simply should not worry a lot about the story. In this sense, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works out and simply serves its goals well. <br /> It's a movie that you will not regret watching once you've finished it but it's also a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing. <br /> 7/10
