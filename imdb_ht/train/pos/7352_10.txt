This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I now hooked! Well then it requires adopting a different attitude for watching US film but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you will not be disappointed. Their songs are superb, melodic and very entertaining. The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the movie world. Local, the colors are spellbinding. If you want something different and are looking to raise, encourage and encourage you to recommend you to catch this movie.
