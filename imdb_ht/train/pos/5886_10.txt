Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world over with their smiles. The combined talent of these two beautiful stars makes this meeting combinations / new movie work. Watch it and look forward to sixty sixty years! Mary challenged society to orient youth with understanding and charm. A touch of drama adds realistic 2000. A set of TV sets up would expand the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray, and Georgette!
