Enjoy watching this film on TCM and watching a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) plays detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Man of Man series". Back to the William Powell 1930's play at the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous actress Veteran Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) became one of the suspects in a murder case / suicide where a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) was found dead and Archer was in a room wound up inside the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Secretary of the Wrede / Archer Raymond) gave a great support and was the brother of Frank Morgan who appeared in the "Oz Wizard" in 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt Heath) appeared in some of these Philo Vance film and also gave a great performance to Robin Hood and Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor can very well be the killer. Enjoy a classic Classic in the past.
