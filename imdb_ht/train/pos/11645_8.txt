I was in France, around March 05, and I love to go to this Film Festival. I knew what the Latin America Cinema of Toulouse, but I never went to it. I decided to go and then I keep Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is stunning. It does not cause impact on me as with the Mexican users, because it was French-subtitled but it's still shocking. <br /> This film is a satire of urban violence, kidnapping and crime in the streets of Mexico. It is a small portrait of the city. In a metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a toughest tone, and I think that, some kind of connection with Cero y van 4. One, the sort of story of God becomes salvation and how much is too much? Man on fire, which was stunningly strong, was also not a satire, but a portrait of the streets in Mexico. Or it is like Brave One. A movie that shocks and hits you in the bowels is very difficult. This is like suspicion to teach, it has some twists and turns twists, but that makes it even more credible. Verdict: A movie that shocks and makes you believe that there is no security on the streets anymore. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performance. Cero y Van 4 is a movie that you will not forget soon. Your leaves shake and stunned.
