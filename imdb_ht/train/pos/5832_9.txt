Ever since seeing this movie as a child, over 30 years ago, I never had to look at her look. From the opening stage of the cone factory, in the car engine running from the back seat of the car, Ollie answered the phone and accidentally pushed out the window by Stan, I think this was perhaps the best movie days are days. And they moved to Fox 20th Century, and while these films were not terrible, they lacked the humorous distribution of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, long time papers, in her latest appearance with the boys, showing up as the doctor is super! quote: "I told goats" his response to Stan asked him how you letter a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up! I would say all in one of my favorite L & H comic.
