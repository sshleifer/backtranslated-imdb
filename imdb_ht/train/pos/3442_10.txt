This movie leaves intellectual thinking and attempts to analyze the story. I also can not understand why people would waste this movie. If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this film can not be suitable for you .. This film presents a high degree of realism. The actors and actresses performances are quizzes. Not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound.effects, so special side effects .. <br /> <br /> The camera work is excellent, the music is oh so good. I can not wait to find the soundtrack. It leaves your body numb, as Constant Garderner.The directly has raw talent, certainly not a follower.
