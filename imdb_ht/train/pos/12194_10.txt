Surreal movie noir released soon after the "real," genre-defined classic "Falcon of Maltese," "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Still Ring Two Times." Welles film should not be evaluated against others. It was played by different rules. In fact, he played. This begins where other film films are left, so the vaguely logic (but interesting) whodunit is decorated with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical quick-fire style), dialogue (many of "hard-boiled" philosophy), and strange acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally a dimension). For Welles genre can mean "formula" but it seemed to love using "mystery" as the origin of "its entertainment."
