This is one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I headed with about 150 people in St. George and we saw this movie at the visiting center of the St George Temple .. There was not one person who had dry eyes at the audience. Also, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormons in the audience who felt the film's spirit and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties that the pioneers spent. After all, it is apart from the American story.
