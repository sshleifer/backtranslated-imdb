This movie surprised me. Some things have been "clicheish" with some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith. But for the most fun-mixing party with Jamie Foxx and Mike Epps comedy and 2 Julio's Juliet's wannabees and Ramundo (gives some funny rescue). This is a movie you can look over again-say ... some night Wednesday when there is nothing else about. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.
