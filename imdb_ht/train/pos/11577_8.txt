This was a really cool movie. It just goes to prove that you do not need funny litle things such as continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, sword is set in fire, samuari fighting on braids down, David Essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the dude. I enjoyed this movie, but i love s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a lot s ** t movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Earth Battlefield you will love this movie, its swashbuckling, its fast, its funny, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It also looks like it was born in 1972
