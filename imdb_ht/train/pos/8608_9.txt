This was a great movie with a good cast, all of them struck on all cylinders. But when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, she just does not get any better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always melee, was even better. It should have a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with an aspect of the scenario. None of the characters ever recognized that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And neither his mother, played by Keaton. At one point he broke a promise he made to a character not to reveal that he was sleeping around. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film had a "political agenda." This is something that is discouraging to say. There was no policy at all in this film.
