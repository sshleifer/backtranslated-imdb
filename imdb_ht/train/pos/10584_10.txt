"Parachute Parade" is fascinating on many levels. There is no way supposedly the scene of the "Prolog Theater" could be produced from any theater on earth, of course. Think of the big pools and three-story fountain height for "By The Cascade," for example. (Berkeley led John Garfield at "They made me a criminal" six years later and the children were dying dead "not a cascade" as they showered.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil "is the best production number in the picture. It's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros. sensitivity. Note the African guys mixed in the scene with white and Asian prostitution. You would never see the blacks integrated into a social scene in other films in the period unless they were babysitting on a train or maid in a big house. Here the black guys sit in the bar and sing with the others. I also get a thrill when the military dancers make a "four section" presentation in Roosevelt's image. There is also the eagle NRA - the logo of the National Controversial Administration Recovery of the New Contractor. FDR was the new president and hoped to be so high that he would pull the nation out of the depression. You might never see such a work oriented class work coming out of MGM, of course. Warner Bros. with all hearts supporting the rise dictated by the F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Miss Miss Ruby keeler had never been better than playing the Chinese Hooker, "Lil." He hardly even watches his feet as he dances, which was one of his signature flaws. <br /> <br /> The pre-code thing is fun. "Not a cascade" number is wonderful in that regard. The girls change their bathing suits on the crowded speed bus at Times Square and its light on. Girls are spreading-malfile swimming on the camera to provide the type of shots that might not be seen for 35 years. In some months the Production Code would eliminate these fun hobbies.
