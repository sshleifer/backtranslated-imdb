Steve Carell has done a career from the guy's show little odd right, first on the 'Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalized on its forces. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in a bad way nice guy in style. One night, while socializing with her co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveal that she is a virgin. Co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) first announced Andy on his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for those decent ones that Andy is, and they are resolved to help him out to help him to end his girl. So start Andy's quest in adulthood. Andy is the innocent excellence, and the bulk of the humor proceeds from his naivety in the situations he finds himself in the movie. Some of the humor is gross gross out stuff, but most of it is just quite intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the movie actually beautifully touched as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships with friends maybe the first time in his life. I'm not trying to show the movie as a love story or a drama; It's a roll in your space comedy. Still, all good comedies I've ever seen have enough heart for you to care for their characters. A good comparison would be the 'Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly liked finishing in the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, she reminds me of 'something about Mary'. Very light and fun; He let you laugh and smile, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.
