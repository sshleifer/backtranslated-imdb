The time is the future and so many people are not aware of it, that day is now. In this final film for legendary actors, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic landmark. Many a movie and environment screens believe this is our eventual event. The film taken in the novel is entitled, 'Make room, make room' but the working title has changed to "Solent Green." The story concerns the Earth as it evolved into the future and environmental issues in the world become nothing short of catastrophic. The natural resources of the planet were exhausted and basic foods were reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know 'real' ingredients in Solent Green and cringe in their own guilt and fear of punishment. The first is a food executive called William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). When he died, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) sought the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes all the way to the top, it begins with Bodyguard Simonsons, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Donnovan Security Chief (Roy Jenson) who target Thorn for a factory drop factory. Chief of Thorn, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes her suspicion but warns her of those 'higher and hot' who wants the case to shut down, but Thorn will not risk her "Job" for an easy way out. What thorns discovered her mark for death, but like the movie, awaiting a final warning. ****
