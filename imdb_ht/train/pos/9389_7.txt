Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage has become involved in a deadly crime without first knowing it, and dominos are leading to increased danger, adventure and misadventure at the Wild West Forlorn Wildlife in the 1990s. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and cage pulls into the mix and understands its usual sardonic and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the draw on the head? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost unlucky killer? Yes. Can Cage Stand A Chance? Well, you have to look and see. It never allowed up, and it took me by surprise the first time I saw it. At second glance, I was surprised to see how it stood, how well constructed it was, and how ridiculous and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is known more for his television work, but with Rounders and this film he shows a nimble hand and sensational cemetery. It is saved by its humor in the way, and by the caricatures. The bar is sleazy, policemen are skeptical. And do not miss a really inspiring voice by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
