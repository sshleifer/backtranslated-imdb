More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger grip for their talent. 7:35 Of the Manana is absolute genius. What Nacho is able to transmit in 8 minutes to take a few hours Hollywood director of film to achieve. I watched this smile, but felt a bit dirty and not in the sexual way. You sit down and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min. nugget. I was entertained, but was disturbed at the same time. Not many people can do this in just 8 minutes. It starts quite simple. A young woman comes in for breakfast in her usual place. He sits with someone start singing. From there, the film takes you to many different emotions all at once it's hard to describe. It's in black & white, but this helps with the feel of the movie to you. This movie makes you want to know more about the characters, how to communicate already and how the finish affects their life afterwards. I guess it's like the old saying, "Let's want more", Nacho Vigalondo is able to do that. Watch this when you can. Show it to your friends and ask how 8 minutes can be fun without taking your clothes.
