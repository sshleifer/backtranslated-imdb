Yes, as other reviews have already stated, this may not be the former L & H but it's far from being worst than the 20th century stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly has all the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys. But it's serious approach to determination that makes them funny. They do not play it for laughing as other comedy would be but to take their jobs and situations seriously and that is the essence of eternal humor. In this film, they have been dealing with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today, namely stress related work. First, we would check out by a doctor and would prescribe some needed rest and possibly stay in the sea. That's where the surrealness comes in in all of this. L & H always takes a much better range of circumstances and exaggerates it, but never at the point of incredible, except perhaps once in a while. This makes us laugh because we can relate to the ones that cause predicaments and attempts at extension. That's what Stan and Universal Callings are. In this movie all these ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and graceful manner. Not much better in comparison with their earliest work probably because this was the latest movie being made for Roach because he wanted the mirror "big" studios and going to perform only features and also wanted to rush up , he concluded contractual obligations. BIG MISTAK! They should all stay together and have continued for perhaps five more years. What the world may miss in not considering this as an option. Watch, laugh, and enjoy this as their latest performance.
