This film seems to be well remembered as Tom's time & Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a long time, adventure, it goes back. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless battle involving a pipe, a frying pan, and a baseball bat that two more butch dogs engaged in at the beginning and at the end of the short. I enjoyed a bunch and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
