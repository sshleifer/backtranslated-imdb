First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see her at a Danish film festival called the Night-film festival which is a lot of different movies to show after the festival's very beautiful festival specializing in cinema shows that should not be shown otherwise in Danish theater. /> <br /> Anyway my friends and I went to see her and we were surprised at how real she looked and that she really hit a rope and our feelings, we really got caught up in the draw without can know which is a big plus in our book. The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of Danish "dogmatic 95" initiatives that started by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In The Dark). At the conclusion of the movie is really worth seeing it provides a different perspective on how things were for the GI American Joe coming from the schools hoping to serve their country in fighting a long way home. <br /> <br /> Also Colin Farrell is outstanding in this movie I have not seen him before but I can not wait to see more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
