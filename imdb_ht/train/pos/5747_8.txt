If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a hard movie to look at, at least in the second half of it. <br /> It is in this segment where we see cute little beats and then someone who is delayed (mentally-challenged) goes to the bottom of the fund after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It's not nice material. <br /> However, it's a good movie and the act is good, too. The story will sit with you shortly. "Dominick" is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this might be the best Hulce role ever. He was looked after by a med student, "Eugene," played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams". Dominick is a goodhearted lover man who reads "hulk" comic books and love battles. It is kind of "normal" guy that you can not help but love and root to live a happy life. When it's freaks out, it's for several good reasons and ... well, see the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coasters and possibly be upset by some of the things you see.
