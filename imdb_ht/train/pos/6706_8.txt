I remember this show as it became a regular look on a Saturday evening. Sabrina is a young girl who moves in with her aunt how she turns out to be witches and she's the one. So Sabrina must learn how to monitor hr power and use them effectively. He also must deal with a vicious rival school named Libby, his best friend and companion Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> The show was funny and fun. She kept Saturday entertaining evening for a 10 year old boy .. and made her laugh out loud ... With little games and 'Libby' ....
