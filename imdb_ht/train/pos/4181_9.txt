It was long since I've seen this film (at least 15 years) and yet it still makes me with a vivid image of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the requirements of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <A unit of Australian underwater demolition expert was captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mission to put mines to a Japanese harbor. Once in jail, these guys expect the same treatment as any other provisional but they are determined to quickly learn from a Japanese prison guard who has been spying since being out of uniform when they were captured. The consequences of such an offense, not Japanese martial arts, are execution by decaying. Despite the struggle, and pleading the sympathetic guard, the day of approach reckoning like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding and the percussion of a market execution squad .. the finish is actually too dangerous to reenact in my mind much less writing it here. But I can promise you - you will never forget it. Good luck to get the video in the United States.
