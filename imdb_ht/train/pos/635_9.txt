I went to a small screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy quest / adventure in some sort. really nothing like I've seen, and is a unique story certainly appreciated and anything else that is currently in or coming soon in the theater. In spite of what initial impressions can provide, it's not cheesy, urine, tacky, or ridiculous, and it's actually very fun and funny. The well thinned, nothing seems to run or drag out. The soundtrack, for lack of best words, is magic and adds much to the movie, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TVs. And even though I might know what has come to point, I still could not bring them to stop watching the screen; in my knowledge, no one left the theater during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> My gray one is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can not figure out why.
