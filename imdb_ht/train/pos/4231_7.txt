While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, a housewife abused (Basinger) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a delinquent youth group taking a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering the indignation in a straight line of DVD released here in the UK, Susan Montford's first director may not be given the gratitude he deserves. This is a shame, as the standard of writing, directing and acting is very good, and certainly unsurpassed the quality of your straightforward DVD to flicker DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her best performance at some time as the wife degrades an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer does not really give anything more than a threatening presence, it is in short scenes that Basinger connects - showing dangerous vulnerability again swelling in the rage that will eventually boil over in its confrontation with the youth. It's a really great, understatement, transformation from the aggressor victim is transparency played. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas initially thought was bad, as he (along with the other three youths) just did not seem so much in a threat. However, all four youths were more physically imposed, the later scenes in which Basinger turned the tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly unhinged, is the key why the movie works as well as it does. Apart from a few rhythm problems during the half-half of the movie with a couple of cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer and something to think about when the movie is over. Some can be removed from the slow - burning nature of the opening stage, or the abrupt ending. Others are not brutally violent. I say it gives a chance, it certainly worthy of your time than Saw V.
