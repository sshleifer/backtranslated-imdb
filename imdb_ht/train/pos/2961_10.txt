This is the only David Zucker movie that does not lazy anything the first of its kind. The funniest movie of 98 and night in the right Roxbury behind but I did not think that Theres something about mary was funny so that does not count except for Frank and her weight items. Do not listen to critics especially Roger Ebert does not know solid entertainment just look at his review. Anyone who sees it you will be disapioned
