Really good horror movie featuring the greatest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. After getting it, Rukh is poisoned by its radiation. All his hand touches the dark side of Rukh to make it an egotist bandit. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) found a limited remedy in the problem and at the same time realized the radiation can be used for the good of humanity by healing diseases. Two fiends will fight on the radiation options. Pretty good effect. Others have cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
