The world has made two different types of cinema ... The "English Patriarch" type, who can not be bothered to enjoy anything that is not high enough to be shown on PBS, and there are "Happy Gilmore" types that an hour and a half of genitalia punishment are definitely worth the $ 7. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there's a ton of gray areas, but you know where you're leaning. If you are an English patient, save your time, save your money, and save you all "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comment. I know, you enjoy the belittling of every film you do not like, and all those who love them, but maybe you might hold in just this once. <br /> But if you are a good luck type of Gilmore. .. go see this one ... You'll find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does. Go check it out. You will be glad you have done. And it's OK.
