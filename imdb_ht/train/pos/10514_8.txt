Emma is a movie theater based on classic Jane Austens. I have not read the book so I really did not know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted almost all the plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of writing in bad or directing. The movie is though for some reason very fun and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I neglected but the majority was quite aggressive and humorous. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine of Emma. The movie also star Toni Collette (who is okay but it was better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who was also better but he is still pretty good here) Alan Cumming (Who I Never Really Impressed and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam (who's performing is rather wild at first glance, but actually fairly subtle, though that was not what he needed) There was the best adaptation of Jane Austen book but this is always very fun and worth watching.
