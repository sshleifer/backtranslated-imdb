"Father of Pride" was another of the good shows that unfortunately does not have a very long life. And that is very sad, especially if you consider that almost all of the time they show their worst are always on air (thinking of "simple life") I admit that many similarities with this show and the "Simpsons" , but despite the similarities, the show has its own merits. The animation is just adequate, not incredible, but good .The best is the characters. All animals are very likable and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have their moments. The music was good, I loved so much of the songs. Even though the show is not very original, I think this was a lot of potential .Like "Mission Hill" a not very popular show but I loved so much, this did not have the appreciation he deserved. What a shame.
