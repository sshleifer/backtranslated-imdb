Wow! I've seen many bad movies recently lately, but this one is great. Realistic portraits of police life in a city on the east coast of Germany are a strong contrast to other crime or series films. I liked the main actress and the absolute rejection of any pre-emptive remnants of the police. This film is realistic as a documentary and entertaining as a drama at the same time. A perfect compromise!
