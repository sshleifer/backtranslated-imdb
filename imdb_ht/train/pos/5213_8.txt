This is the first review I wrote for IMDb so to do with me, but I kept this flick on HBO and was sure to be happy to watch it. Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent / detective who threw the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and never a dull scene that slows down the pace of the movie down. Some parts of the movie that have iron and abusive gender are very shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to abduct the scenes just fine. <br /> So, all in all, if you are looking for a good detective movie / suspense, ignore the rating given to this movie to receive IMDb and definitely watch it.
