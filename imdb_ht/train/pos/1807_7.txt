This is one of the movies I can remember, or maybe the first one. Exactly the cute kind of movie passed a kid, sweet, in the world of violence and addiction we lived. A little bit of babe, casino and Constantine, all this well mixed into a cardboard, and we get this. I do not know if it's really rated for the kids, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate when a movie (specifically a cardboard) can have a good end and break it because every character must have a happy end, though it sounds strange (I'm not a bitter person) .But this was OK, it too Simply go to heaven and leave it in that way. <br /> <br /> All this is just a criticism, It's a good movie a new thing. much touch and I have to go
