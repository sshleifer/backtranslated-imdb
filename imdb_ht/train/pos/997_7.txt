I must agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? for me she leaned a little bit towards the comedy side. I could be a great movie without the comedy and was horribly comparable. Jamie keeps running in Julio and what's his name. In New York, how often do you run to someone you know in Downtown Cleveland.E just how Robert Pastorelli dig up the Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or drama? But it was always fun especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed Kimberly Elise's performance, she certainly is a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who will be solid.
