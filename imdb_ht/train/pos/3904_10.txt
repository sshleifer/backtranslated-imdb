In my opinion, this is the best stop-up show I've ever seen. I became an Eddie fan instantly after seeing the dresses killed, but I must say I think this is his best job. I would say, though, if you ever get the chance definitely go see it live. It is worth it! Most of the time after seeing a standing-up routine once couples, the jokes begin to get old. But I said, I saw this show so many times that I literally have everything to memorize (which is yes, I realize it's a bit sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dress up to kill will never be old for me. I own it and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
