Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for his father speakeasy in a little small town. He also sold it to men. He saved New York and literally sleeps his way to the top. Originally I've only seen the version 71 minutes but it's very extreme - for its time. Nowadays it is very gifted. The movie is moving very quickly and has tons of sexual impairments - some of it comes as pretty funny (but fun) today. It moves quickly you can easily ignore that most of it can never happen - even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monument on this - it's just a quick, gleefully little movie room that's great fun. It only falls apart at the end with a little "moral" that ends up being questioned. It comes across as incredible and stupid (I've seen it in a theater and the audience laughs at it - one guy just says "No way") I just saw the unut 75-minute version of a different, as tragic and much better finish. This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I believe this is the only one to drop - but you must be aware. <br /> <br /> The act is a good thing - Stanwyck jumps in his role and plays it way over the head. It makes you believe that he enjoys being wicked and asleep around. There are also strong performances supported from beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for a John Wayne pre-voodoo in a bit hilarious as a worker who is tired and sober office! Fun, dirty and fast. I give this a 9.
