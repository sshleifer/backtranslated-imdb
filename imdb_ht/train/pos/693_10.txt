This is an almost action-less film to Jack, an ensomniac, as it goes to hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself on a building and, for a long time, can not tell reality from hallucinations . <br /> Dominic Monaghan, as Jack, is truly credible. Confused, and scary but lethargy, and, at times accepting cleverly in what he sees, we follow him trying to sort out what he sees and finds a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce a talk dog (another hallucination) and kids who suddenly appear in Jack's toilet and room without any explanation of how they were (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, boggling mind, 43 Minutes and showers are enough to get any fans belly come back for more.
