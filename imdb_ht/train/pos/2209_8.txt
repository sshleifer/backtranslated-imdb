In my opinion, this is a wonderful celebrity show skit. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as host. There are many reasons I have said this. Though Hal Sparks was an armed host, I sometimes hope that Greg Kinnear did not leave. If you ask me, it seems that nobody stays with a TV show while running it again. Still, I enjoyed seeing various hosts and other parody celebrities. If you ask me, that was pretty darn funny. Before I wrap this up, I must say I'm kind of missing this show. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all your dead-hard fans demonstration shows. You will really enjoy it.
