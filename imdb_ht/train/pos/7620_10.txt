The object is the best television series there. First of all, it has GREAT actors and pretty directly. The writing is a very controversial issue because of the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after the epic 3 writing became very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why have polar bears on the island? What is the Fog? How does the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? A lot of people think that the writers are lost and raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can not explain. I believe that these people are wrong. I am confident in the writers. I think if the mysteries will appear in the now all the charm of the series will go.Anyway, losing is the endenyable television series greatest and it will continue for a long time.
