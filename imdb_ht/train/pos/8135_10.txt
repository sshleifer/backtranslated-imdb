I'm shocked. Shocked and scared that the 428 of your IMDB user who voted before me was not given this movie a rating higher than 7. 7 ?? - that's a C! If I could give FOBH a 20, I would be happy to do it. This film overlays pantheon in modern comedy, along with Half Cooked with Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films ever. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you must see that !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something!, And then see that! The comparison of 'Spin Tap' does not appreciate the inspiring genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Watch it and vote it 10!
