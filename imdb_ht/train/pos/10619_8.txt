Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach in the "Spy That Loves Me" Fame) with her two Karen Lamm assistants (just Spunky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the beautiful Lois Young, who is not only killing first-time, but also his yummy bodys bar in a tasty nude free show) goes to Solvang, California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all local hotels are booked solid, three beautiful ladies are forced to seek room and board in a swanky, but foreboding remote mansion owned by Austin Keller (delightful play in geeky perfection, great Sydney Lassick) and Best his sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a very nasty embarrassment and dark pond living in his basement thanksgiving: a portly, pathetic, crown, incendiary-male Mongoloid named Junior (a touching touch and scary portrait by Stephen Furst, Flounder of "Animal House"), who naturally gets loose and Wreaks some murder killers. May be directed by Danny Steinmann, who has a good player who drives out a solid throw, a plot too discontent, excellent make-up by Craig Reardon, a nicely creepy atmosphere, a great score, a slow but steady , well-trained characters, and a surprisingly heart-breaking final free frame (the insult subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch), this unjustly overlooked early 80 psychic trains is well worth the power.
