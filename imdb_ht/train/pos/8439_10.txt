For all the homicide junkies out, this movie was great! Each single character on which the show was made an appearance in the movie. It helped resolve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually watch the series, most of the fun would lose, as the movie made heavy references in every season of the show's existence. This would probably be appropriate as a final set as opposed to being a separate film, but we have to take what we can find. I hope to make more movies, and continue to present homicide characters to the Law and Order.
