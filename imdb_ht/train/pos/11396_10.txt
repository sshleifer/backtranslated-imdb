Calling two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning movie has it all - prodictive Technicolor along with costume, breathtaking cinematography, superb wall-to-wall music gershwin, superior choreography, a lightweight-over-air movie, and performance great by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary, and Caron. Hollywood does not make it like this again. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard where I judge all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
