As you take the role that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene play on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play a couple of funny old time vaudeville, a team of traditions of Joe Smith and Charles Dale who seem to have a different outlook on life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is an old crotchety who has the best days behind him with his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is to get less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt her seriously was that some 15 years earlier her partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with her family. A workaholic like Matthieu can not understand it and make Burns's decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits on a brain storm, meet the guys and make it on a national national television. What's happening here is very hilarious. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are also a sad, bitter story as well over old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the movie, but it's Burns who got the kudos in the form of an Oscar in the old age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a bit of the staff of this movie as well. As we all know it was the right man in the wonderful comedy team of Burns & Allen that Monty Python troops lend much to. In 1958 due to health reasons Gracie Allen retired and George kept going up to age 100. Or at least very close as an active scene. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine boys are based on the team of Smith & Dale however and if you like the Sunshine boys I recommend you see Two Broadway Tickets for a look at a pair of guys who have been entertaining American in public in the turn of last century. Doctors draw that Matthau and Burns do is directly in their materials. <br /> And I think you'll love the Sunshine boys.
