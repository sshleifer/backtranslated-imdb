I admit that not that fan of Oliver! As a toddler - it's long, and the story is a little slowing-moving because of all the music numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this film is the experience itself. Rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. The loose adaptation of the best, but really, if you're watching a music, you're not there for the story. <br /> <br /> The music is the core of this movie, and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very enticing. Most or all of the cast took part in the stage version of the music, and it shows the performance - and I consider this a plus. Performances are all in a "more" style of typical acting in many older films and are very fun. The exception is the kid playing Oliver, whose work seemed to be beautiful look and stayed out of the real performer's way. <br /> Fagin's winning is the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also performs a fantastic job to keep an intimidating screen presence as Sykes threatening Bill. Even Sykes' Bullseye dog puts on a good performance. This movie is not for everyone. Musical haters will despise it, as they will be musicians too seriously. Nitpicking on historic historical defeats or exaggerated stage-acting scenes for evil acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's best if you remember that, as a music, it's a fantasy injuries organized in the book, not a strict adaptation.
