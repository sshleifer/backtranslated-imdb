I love the newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the scenario and Kate dropped to the principal. I want to find out what happened to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I like her scene with Grandad. I still love James Garner in all that he does, and he's a credit acting him that I never thought of as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believing in it as Kate's father. This family is so real and funny. It was sad sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life things happened and the way he wrote in the series and faced with was both funny and sad and always very sensitivated and lovingly faced and. But generally a very funny and very fun and fun show.
