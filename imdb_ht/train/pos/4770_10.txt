The only show I've watched since 90210! Why was it stopped? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and make you feel like you are part of it all! The least should be done is to drop it on DVD! I checked out similar shows, but nothing came off. The cast had incredible chemistry and I looked forward to every episode and anticipation. <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling shows. If anyone has any information about where to find a DVD in North Shore please post a few lines here. Thanks! Aloha!
