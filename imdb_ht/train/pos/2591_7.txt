Offbeat and rather entertainment travelers regarding two very different fees that are both not only the so-called "fire starters" (think Stephen King's hat-Fest in a book containing the same name), but also forever at odds one and others about a woman who have a rather nasty habit of being a piromaniac! Good effects (especially towards end), original performance from a very talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and unusual way to finally make "Wilder Napalm" a unique treat in a movie to watch. if you can get it is! On a personal note, I was fortunate enough to snatch it up (so to speak) out of the bin of dollars in my local rental-rental locations. (*** from *****)
