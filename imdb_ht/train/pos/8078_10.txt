Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It's my favorite movie. It gives a powerful message to the family. She has a lot of violence and has a song and a bunch of girls in bikini. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action scenes of this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the American godfather, Amitabh shows that in this movie. Do not read reviews by critics, they're just ignorant. This film has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (always good movie), this is the movie.
