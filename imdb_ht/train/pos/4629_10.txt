My father was the guards in the prison (he is now retired) presented in this documentary and I grew up in prison's life, so maybe my opinion will be totally different from everyone else watching this movie . I'll say that, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) Show up and say this story, B) Get inside these minds and hearts, and C) Is all this responsible. Responsible in the art, and, most importantly, responsible for the prisoners and employees of Luther Luckett correctional complex. They should be congratulated for this work. To take 170 hours, yes HOURS, at foot and can be cut and blittle down to 93 minutes riveting nothing short of extraordinary and have my utmost respect. <br /> I saw this film under the circumstances that only a very, very few were able to see it. I was in the prisoner's screening. I was in the same room with these guys as they looked at their heart being drained out on the screen. I saw people weeping in the television crying in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very profound experience. These men committed serious crimes in some cases, but found ways to try to redeem themselves, even though they viewed themselves as unredeemable. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could do what they did in a harsh environment? To see them react to the movie was an experience I'm grateful for, and I will never forget. I thank the guys who have allowed me to glimpse into their lives, thank my father for doing everything possible, and I thank Philomath Films to take time to pour blood, sweat, soul and water into this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life, and prisoners held in it. 'Oz' is not real, television is not real. 'Shakespeare behind bars' is.
