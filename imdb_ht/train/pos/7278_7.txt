Ghosts that still walk is one of the films that grabs you and does not let go until the end, especially when you see it as a child. Seeing the movie as an adult, you have to admit it is not really all that scary, but the story is very fascinating and includes great mysterious scenes (especially those with the clown mummy) <br /> One scene The best of the film is without a doubt the scene with dad and grandmother of the new RV; The scene and the stones are very interesting and beautiful scary. Also the scenes where the main character discovering her mother's secret is very scary. <br /> Well, acting in the movie is not all that great and the movie sometimes seems to get a little bit boring, but overall fantom that still walks is fun. Too bad only a few people have seen this film, this movie really deserves better. I just mean: Mr. Flocker, you did a great job! And for all your Hollywood producers out there; If you want to notice a movie, notice this one!
