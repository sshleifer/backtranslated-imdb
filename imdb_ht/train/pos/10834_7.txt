I did not approach "Still crazy" with any real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll rock, I figured out ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partially so, but so much more. Brian Gibson, the director, has already eliminated a biography of Tina Turner, and is quite successful in his style. I think it is fitting that this was his latest movie. <br /> <br /> Throw is well selected. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as frontman band. Actor-turned-director Bruce Robinson appeared as the guitarist-wash band. He does a superb job, even though he has not appeared on film since late 70s. If you are looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you've found it. <br /> 7.4 out of 10
