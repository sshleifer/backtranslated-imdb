I found memorable quotes for searching video clips; They forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> Old man 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old man 2: You remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old man 1: And I can remember you've fallen for that, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old man 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You Did It. You put a huge bucket on your head and take off with them boy armies to fight martians. <br /> <br /> Old man 2: Do not you die again?
