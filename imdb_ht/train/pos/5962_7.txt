I saw a slaughter of "80s rocker horror" over the years, from garbage like "Horror on Tour" to ridiculous gentlemen such as "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Somehow I managed to keep putting this one off, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well-received one. Well, I finally keep up with it and it's easy to do this especially terrible (but almost always endearing!) Subgenre. The plot (which was pretty much awakened in the movie "Black Roses") worries a misfit misfit named Eddie, whose ridicule is not all in his high school for his taste in music. He likes 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by tons of great Tony Tony.) After Sammi dies, Eddie favorite radio DJ gives him the final Sammi recording. Once Eddie plays the record backs, he discovers it is a bit tougher, and bad things start happening with people who taunt him. Has Sammi music been owned? "Trick or Treat" is well-made with a total scout. Special effects are awesome, though it presents the typical laser 80s bars. I grew up in the 80s, and while I was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the urban legend about playing a record record to hear the sounds of worshiping Satan. Haha! I also remember being told by my older sibling and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's very fun to see them both make cameras as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If only I've seen this movie as a kid! While the movie seems to be keen to enjoy the popular connection of the 80s between devotional devotion and heavy metal worship, the viewer never really discovered why Sammi Curr is back from the death of havoc and murder that will come in the way li. This is the weak point film, but if you can neglect it, it's loads of pleasure.
