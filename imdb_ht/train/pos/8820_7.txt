I watched the movie while recovering from great surgery. While I knew it was only a "B" movie, a western space, I loved it. It may have missed the flash of high-dollar high-yield production that made my imagination and gave great escapism. Unfortunately our corporation has many available, small attempts to discount is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy the same school performance in Shakespeare's class, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art of being. I am a cop and found affiliate with the LAPD retiree. Dreams like her haunt me that I'm going to be able at this time of crisis to be able to answer for another's life (or my own). while it was a romantic end where farnsworth made out the bad guy (predictable) i needed a little romance happy where good triumph can be. My world is really too cynical.
