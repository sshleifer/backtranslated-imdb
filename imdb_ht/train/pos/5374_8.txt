William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder last year in a very bad condition with the intention of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY), and become friends of neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, strange events occur at home, including the death of Sophie's chat. At Sophie's birthday party, a pipe leaks out and leave the place, releasing a secret later. <br /> <br /> The "Wounded House of Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes in the series "Hammer House of Horror". The fantastic twist, disclosing a secret, and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The Wounded House of Death")
