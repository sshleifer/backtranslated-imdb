Anyone know, where can I see or download "what i love about you" season 4 episodes in the internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany will not be shown on TV. Please help me. I want to see epic 4 episodes seriously. I already see Episode 4 and Episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not get more episodes in season 4. Can there be a website where I can see these episodes? Because I read some commentary from forums from Germany and there were those who had already seen the 4 episodes though they had not been shown on TV in Germany. I am pleased about all the information I can find. Thanks Kate
