Pinjar is a really good movie, with great acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. It seems to me that the quality of the Bollywood film is producing is quite improving these days, and this movie is one evidence. <br /> No Bollywood movie that I can remember in doing such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - amazed at the various emotional situations that test people into someone. The movie rests on the great act of Urmilla Matondkar, and also some of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition, and all the problems seem sweet if compared to the problems it's happening in face. <br /> A must-see movie. A superior technology to Bollywood, which I feel is comparable to the best films coming from other countries in the world.
