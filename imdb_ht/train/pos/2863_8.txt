Although this show was in the air since 1973, after watching a DVD set in our library, I felt compelled to say a bit about it. <br /> I can remember when it was shown in colors only on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a little "Sunday Night Party" and friends watch this on NBC on one of the few color TVs. I really enjoy stories not so much for name and date, but how it influences us today and how much so profoundly based on the most inconspicuous actions of the moment. Case of point: Virginia City, Nevada, has become one of the richest cities in the world because of the agent, got its name to a character named "Old Virginny", who, in the early days of the city , stumbled out of a saloon, dropped and broke his whiskey. Old Virginny did not want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid wept in the dirt she decided to besiege the town "Virginia Town". The area became known as the Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to claim everyone and the area became known as the Comstock Lode. <br /> I just looked at an early episode that faced these two subjects. Other episodes were faced with literary developments by Mark Twain while a reporter for the Territory's Enterprise ... He had fun (and often education) family entertainment. As someone else noticed, every episode would really be considered a movie in its own rich and character scripts. <br /> One thing to twist the truth about was the proximity to Virginia City and the Ponderosa. In fact, boarding the Ponderosa (all Northern Lake Tahoe), one should ride his horse over 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down the Spooner Summit in the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) in the Carson Valley then other 30-40 miles in Virginia City. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwrights would have some to do behind the back on a regular basis. But every writer should have some leeway and truth. <br /> How I miss this, even today.
