Today's sci-fi trial trials are more like exterior-space rambo and special monster effects (often spongy like sounds of space explosions). Even if tasted by today's standards, the special effects of "Banned Planet" have been quite striking for their time. Even today, they still hold plausibility. However, the best part of the movie is perhaps why radio radios still have appeal. Much of what has gone on has left up to their imagination at the hearing. (What are the intelligent creatures to look like?) There is not much of the foundation in the story that has never been disclosed or only disclosed to the end, the tension and suspension that occurred throughout the film. The ending also thought many-provoking and satisfied. In my head, this is always one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movie ever made.
