I had the privilege of viewing this film at the Film Film Festival in Rotterdam. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 movie movie on a father and her two sons. The father has a traditional basin somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local, especially aged men, relax and go swimming. The father has a son: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a great modern city and who comes to visit him. For this son the traditional village, the bathtub and his 'retarded' brother looks strange and annoying, but that's changed along the movie. Even though the story can sound cheesy or clich√©, it's not. With really great performance, especially in the father and the 'delayed child' (sorry, I do not know the names) and a great story of being touched and funny at the same time. you got a chance to see this movie doing it. It's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br />
