Is the future awaiting us? An overpopulated, unforgiving desert with a hellish, unwanted desire? This film brings to you a problem that always plagues us, so that the movie was released in 1973. Let's hope that the world will not end up like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed so much. It has a distinctive character, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a convincing and thought-provoking storyline, with the man-made man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film something very unpleasant, smell. You are almost choked by the stench of the city and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The wonderful characters. Charleton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. The man created the badass role, but likable hard-guy. I could definitely put myself in the Thorn shoes. He sees that something is not good, but everyone around him either does not listen (more like pay no cost) or he wants to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays the old Sol Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which he resides. The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Green Soylent Factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "shovels" (bulkheads that get rid of people) were excellent. The air polluted outside looks lousy and very embarrassing. The empty empty town filled with the poor and sad people are very unsettling. A final note is the finish, which even now always shakes me. It is green, but if you think about it, it's a very good idea. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: <br /> An excellent sticker in Science Fiction 70 which makes you think and lets you feel very comfortable.
