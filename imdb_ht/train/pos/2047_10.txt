This movie hit my home. When I'm 29, I remember '80 and my dad working in a factory. I figured, if I worked hard, if I was proud and never gave up I could have dreamed the American, the house, a few children, a whole car called my own. I noted however, without a degree of something (unlike my father who left in ninth year) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can not find anywhere. <br /> I would like to know if someone has this movie about DVD or VHS. he did for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. I do not find it anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, my family and other family, to see what they think and remind them that once upon a time Americans would work for the sake of honoring feelings and that we were proud in what we accomplish !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavily heavily armed and many things are done overseas.
