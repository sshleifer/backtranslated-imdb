You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's sleeping ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Up to April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of speech, but when we got it to the revolution, it seems that Portuguese people lost his opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech ! It's all a consequence of the revolution! I think this is clear! ... On the movie ... I think he has a few mistakes about acting some character, but by the way I used to watch his Portuguese movies in good shape !! I love it very much!
