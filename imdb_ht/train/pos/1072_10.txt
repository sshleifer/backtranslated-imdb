I would like to comment on the series as a major effort. The story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty good, especially in season 1. Season 2 however became more of a freak show, and lost the original DA charm. Season one story line was more interesting, a light side of the life of JM pony while a serious scheme focused and manticore chase the X series. I was looking forward to new season, in fact I am still alive. I hope the FOX guys and DA crews realize that a lot of ppl always wait for DA to make a comeback. Even after 2 years of it was canceled, DA could do it great if worked on well, and I think a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge.
