A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least give up for effort. "Hole" does not make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie on infamous teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in detail. The flashback scenes really make a goal and present several subjects that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit taken off by the gravity of the film. But soon I realized that we had endured these moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to this story this film also does a great job of questioning some methods used in correctional facilities. (An example where caveman strictly teaches zero it because they have dug holes in order to build characters, such as learning it will not contribute to that). "Holes" is a smart and beautiful movie. A must look!
