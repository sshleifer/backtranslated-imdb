Character completely rounded to the main role of this movie, that's the cop worn up in his past and on a path to self destruction so clear the viewer is unique for its time, 1950. < br /> <br />> Together with the horrific music and the well-written scheme, the movie is a first example of its best movie. Dana's blind eyes reveal the bitterness, Karl Malden excelled as his boss, who flok has no nonsense, but also has compassion for those under his command in the polls. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger has made this kind of movie just about his own. If there is any fault he should and the breath take the beauty of Gene Tierney that looks strange out of place with the stubborn cop. The scenes of the cafe, however, are wonderful and true rings. Tom Tully, in the bit part of his father is perfect as Gary Merrill as the hood. Great lighting and mood settings. The building where deadly deeds take place very atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
