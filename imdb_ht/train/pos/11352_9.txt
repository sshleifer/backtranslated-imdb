This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the first Soviet Union to become serial killer. I was hooked, just waiting for a half-movie television movie, but finding myself drawn by the way the story was said. As others have said, many admired here are sadly lacking in many large screen releases. Much of the credit must go to Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent grim and direction the viewer's draw, until it is impossible to feel emotionally involved. Acting in the entire cast is also superb, especially those of the two drivers, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Paintings are persuaded to give the arch characters a great deal of credibility, and scenes in which they first meet their first committee meeting after Perestroika is truly touched. If you prefer your crime movie with a bit more depth and a little less Sheen, I recommend you look out for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
