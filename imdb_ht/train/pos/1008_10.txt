I received this excellent program in season 4 and since then I've seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and keep getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. It can now be No Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black has always provided the show more forceful and original even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately now the sci-fi channel has got rid of this amazing show with no relay expected for a season 11 having to make two direct DVD movies and hopefully more. Atlantis is still strong about its 4th quarter. And there is a third turn off of the stargate franchise work is nowhere near to die. This TV show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and folks who have this because there are so many things to appeal to all ages and all kinds of people Watching it !!!!! 10/10
