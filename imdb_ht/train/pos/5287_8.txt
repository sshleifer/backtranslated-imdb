This is one of quite a few drawings with bunny bugs and Marvin the Martian - and a spacecraft called K-9 is also included. This Looney Tunes Episode is very funny, there is reasonable animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the draw is well done. The end is rather unusual, so be prepared for it, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martyr was sent to earth to take a beast and bring it back to Mars. With his 9-dog trusting dog, Marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks no other rabbits but Bugs Bunny! He salutes and treats, thinks are trick or tret in costumes. Little does he realize that they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> I recommend this episode to all those who love Bugs Bunny, Martian Martins and Monkey Loons in general. As far as the beginning and middle of the episode are concerned, you are most likely to love this. Enjoy "Hasty Rabbit"! :-)
