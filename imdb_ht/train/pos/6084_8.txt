I was pleased and thrown to reputable players. The story is the one to stand for a reason, even if you are at personal risk in doing so. At a time where violence and pain are often in film premiere, this film focuses on old fashioned cop good. Although plots just as they were repeated, these guys pulled it well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master of taking on a movie.
