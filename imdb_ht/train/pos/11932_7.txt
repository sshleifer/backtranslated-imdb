I saw this film on television many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on tapes. I thought this was reasonably well done. It was not best in any movie, but it was good enough. The movie has enough talent to inspire many people, especially the younger children. The act was good, with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot was not very credible, but the script was well written. This film can also be of interest to fans of baseball fans. It does not apply directly to an action-packed movie. It's directly applied to a beautiful movie that you can watch with your family and learn some hidden messages in this movie. In general, the movie was good, but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10.
