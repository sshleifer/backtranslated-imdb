This was a personal favorite of me when I was young, it was everything that was great with 90 children's movies ... adorable dinosaurs, cute kids, a unique villain, and a few big songs (and are not the typical little mermaid / beauty and kind of animal types, but the ones that are entertaining fun)! I'm running this movie again lately and I still love it as ever! I recommend that everyone of all ages should see this film, and I definitely think it should be in the younger generations! sorry by the most informative, I'm kind of a hurry ... just please trust me. Everyone who goes against this film will kill the children of the interior!
