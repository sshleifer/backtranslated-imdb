I can not accept negative feedback from other reviews. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe a very young person? I left the movie happy that I was not swayed by reviewing IMDb. 14 hours later I'm still trying to find the flaw in the draw but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it for yourself and make your own mind. <br /> It follows a pattern similar to Basic Instance 1 but the draw is less confused. It always leaves me asking at the end but in a most satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and tender as before and puts it 48 years beautifully; This remains its definite role. David Morrisey was satisfied even though he was not Michael Douglas. At the disposal of my support I particularly liked David Thewolf as the police detective.
