This film is incredible. With great characters, especially the old extreme that can fly in the form of fireball and jumping across the trees, this movie tells a classic story of fighting between the good and the evil forces. The final confrontation is especially enchanting and music scores are as cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable.For kids younger though. This deserves a 10.
