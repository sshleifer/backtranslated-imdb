This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know, I've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken it this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you do not like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will be very likely to like it. It's as simple as that. <br /> Now, if you're still reading this I hope you like Arnold. Good for you! It is good is not it. The Running Man is a very typical Arnold characteristic. It has received the usual retro-future we know well from the B-Sci Fi 80, having received a bunch of one-material terrible, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine with a sequel happy heart. <br /> <br> In this case, the evil opponent is the 1984-all-governed government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control and gladiator-type game show. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his confederates, and the good looking Amber. <br /> It's not a big movie movie, but it still manages to create a very good atmosphere in the future, with some beautiful paintings and lying to help it. It's hopelessly the 80, but I find that good. Acting is varied, Arnold does his usual grunt and shameless stuff, with a help of stone-faced a-liner covered. The heroine of Amber is placed lightly, somewhat stereotyped, and subtilly called Lady Killian is a typical male TV man. <br /> <br /> In spite of all of it's flaws, the movie displays its message very clearly; TV is an opiate in the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some of the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change face to a foolish audience video. This does not seem futuristic to all today, which is somewhat alarming. <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies before then you know when to look this one. Enjoy.
