There is an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training" movies, so it is surprising that this one has received little notice when first released. Watch lots of luck to have a well-deserved second life on DVD / VHS. <br /> Tigerland is not exactly great by any means, there are some very cliched characters (especially the painter of the NCO, making you long to return to Ermey Full Metal Jacket Lee) but the lead performance of Colin Farrell is the thing in instant speedboards. Charisma burns with the role of any actor would kill them to get.
