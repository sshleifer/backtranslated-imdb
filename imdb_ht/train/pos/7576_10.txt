The third, and final slice of the "Hanzo Razor" is the most concrete of them all. The "training" even completed in the first five minutes of the movie. Not for everyone, this movie details the Hanzo inquiry into loan borrowers being made by a monk blind order. He also made a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old Japan incorporating Western technology. Where the first movie in Hanzo was just a funny and gory ride with a small connection to his draw, "Hanzo 3: Who Got the Gold" managed to connect everything and bring it all home to the end. Definitely the perfect final. Oh, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is a lot of blood and blood (it * is * Hanzo razor's after all).
