*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad had stuck this movie to me when I was 3. At age 5, I watched it over 400 times. I just looked at her and looked at her. And I still do today! It has a grim storyline, a lamb is killed by a wild animal - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb was made in something really really looking. He and the wolf are traveling in his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing wild animals, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his ex-friends, he can not return to his previous way of life. Well, okay, and voice acting is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, you just * have * to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although, it is very difficult to get today. <br /> <br />
