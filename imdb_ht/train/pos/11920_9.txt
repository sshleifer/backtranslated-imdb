Christopher Lloyd is funny and truly credible as "Going Alone." This movie is better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a better and written draw. <br /> OK - it was written for kids, but adults were as fun as their kids did. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a taxi reunion. Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be very humorous in his emotions as well as showing some real talent to act for a change, a beautiful change. <br /> <br /> Look at at least once - it is worth the effort to catch it.
