I must admit that this is the kind of movie that I would normally eschew, but I rent it basically because of the stars. I certainly did not regret. In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and acting superior. Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who have decided to commit blood crimes in stealing parental jewelry stores. The crime goes terribly wrong - so start a test of the three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the whole relationship between father and child. <br /> <br /> Smaller fees, Hank are basically a vis-up. It has always been a problem to keep up with a very beautiful job and go in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, loose, and greatly under the influence of his big brother. Etan Hawke has Hank character "nailed to a T" and provides what's probably best performance it is too far. It shows us a man who is fundamentally good-hearted, but is so influenced by outside forces that he is able to follow through with any significant work. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - looks like a successful businessman, but we soon discover that she is addicted to drugs and has degraded her company to pay for her habits. He is Andy who concocts the plot to rob his parents' store, and it becomes weak-anticipated Hank to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors in our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to show someone who, on the surface, is a good businessman loved by his friends, but a real slippery ball bottom. He is absolutely perfect for the Andy party or he might say that, through his superior acting skills, Andy made the perfect party. Albert Finney plays a common father in his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad man or an enfeeling, but he has a disgusting relationship with his son because he never really understood what was needed to promote a positive bond between his sons and himself. He was still too quick to criticize and warn. She has always made it clear that she favors her younger son on her ad so causing a wide emotional rift between herself and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy, Andy thinks that a stolen plan from his father gets less incredible. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminds me of my own dad, and how many Andy and Hank remind me of my own brother and myself. Perhaps this can be one of the reasons I've been enjoying the movie as much as this story of a far, critical father, a successful successor, and a less successful less hit one so close to the home. Fortunately, my brother and I never reached the state of committing a crime against my parents - guess we made in star and more moral things .. <br /> <br /> This complex of personality and action was Excerptly joined the director of Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the chop to give the audience refreshing characters and corner-of-chairs actions that hypnotizes. 12 Mad Men was his first film made fifty years before Before the Devil knows you're dying, but he has not lost any little of his magic touch in showing us the characters that will be time to remember. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. However, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment that I highly recommend.
