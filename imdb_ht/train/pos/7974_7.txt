I found this movie to be the usual French calm in America's face. The camera, all too often, focuses on fat people, at home sloppy and on rural minish areas. While the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small towns that are presented to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and the demiors. There was, undoubtedly, the thin men must see Glencoe with his own, organized house, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what had to be seen. I can only hope that some Indian filmmakers will go to Africa to reveal to its public American worst elements. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that all is not well. Foreign immigrants are not easily integrated, thereby creating serious social inequality. But Americans are not eager to demonstrate the French for the prejudices of their own compatriots and jealousy in the U.S., so we can not see the film on the subject.
