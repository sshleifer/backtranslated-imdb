I just watched "California" on Showtime for the fourth time since I saw it back in July 2001. You would think with the recent wave of movie killer films, that "California" would be amongst the few The earlier films are worth mentioning, but no. Perhaps if this movie was released sometime between 1996-1999, maybe it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "California" is much different from most serial serial killers released during the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serious blood clots as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer films showed a killer but this man still behind a mask or we never see enough of them actually learn anything about them. "California" is a movie that is currently trying to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal idea. It tries to answer questions such as "why do they do things? Is it because of something that has happened in the past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do so because they love the thrill of killing? "These are some of the things that" California "are trying to answer but also leave room to try and figure things for ourselves. Brad Pitt has an eternal impression as Early Grayce. When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film, we see that it is obviously one disturbed by people. When we first saw it, it was late at night. Early is maybe drunk. We then saw him picking up a stone, dropping it to a bridge, and later landing on fast cars before passing a car. Pitt is bad in this movie. It's always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. It's funny that this would be his lead to playing a True Man like "12 Monkeys" and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum of David Seven "seven".
