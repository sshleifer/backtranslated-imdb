This is one of those movies that, after watching it, you'll keep thinking about and coming back in the same month after watching. Acting is spectacular for starting two kids (I usually hate movies and teenage teen acting). Bill Paxton is awesome, his first director is even better than what I expect from an actor whose most memorable line is "Game Over, People! Game Over!" (from the film "Aliens"). The best part of the movie is the dichotomy between scenes where actors play a family, and when they are doing "work." He really makes the movie credible and memorable. <br /> Hold it up, Bill. I'll wait for more movies I 'm sure you love!
