I do not get out of the ten star rating easily. A movie really has to impress me, and the Bourne Ultimatum has gone beyond that. In addition, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the biggest trilogy of motion pictures in our time. Though all three films could not have been more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in successful cinemas. The Bourn Ultimatum made me want to cry that the set was complete, but I could not even try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> At the time the opening title appeared, I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass did it again. All we love from Bourne's movie premiere is here again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the unstable camera. However for me, last one was never a problem. I think he adds in the suspense. <br /> I'll be back to see this movie several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfied conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy.
