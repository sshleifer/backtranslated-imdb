I really liked both Shrek movies. (Since both of them "PG" and have words in them I would never say to myself, so I do not like them.) But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," which I just barely Looking for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated films, other than Pixar. *** Spoilers front *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," is a horse rider that occurs and eventually becomes the leader of his hear. One night she saw a strange light in the distance, and she lay in her direction. This action eventually leads to his capture, and several more things. Throughout the movie we hear a narration. It's the thoughts of the Spirit, even if the horses never talk. This is what makes the movie so Goo. They (the movie makers) have renewed real horses to make their horses' horses sound; No of these sounds were made by people. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets rain, a beautiful tide, and Little Creek, a Native American, who owns rain. Little Creek later liberated spirit and rain, they went running home. <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy this film band in the near future. <br /> Look at this movie and you will not regret it. My Notes: 10/10
