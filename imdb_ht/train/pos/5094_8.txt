If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold on your hat and enjoy the adventure. I liked the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I saw it dozens of times, but this movie is every bit as good, only different. I will not detail the differences because it would spoil the movie. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a great Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze thoroughly Quatermain, and cast the support is superb. I get the quality of dropping to support one of the brands in a Hallmark Production and this movie was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
