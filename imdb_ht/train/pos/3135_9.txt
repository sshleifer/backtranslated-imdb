I liked this movie. I knew it would be full of camps and silliness as the original set. I found her warmhearted to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once more. Anyone who liked the Batman series from the 60's should be enjoyed Back to the Batcave. You could say that the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet it would be happy to fly back into his Batman suit the script has asked him to do so. I told a number of friends on this movie who chose not to see it ... now they wanted to be. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for the rays of Adam and Burt.
