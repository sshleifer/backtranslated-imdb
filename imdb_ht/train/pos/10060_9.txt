Wang Bianlian is an old street scene that is known as a 'King of Masks' for his mastery of Sichuan art to change. Liang is a famous opera performer in Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a human. Liang is worried that a precious art would not die with Wang and so he sowed the seeds of an heir to Wang's idea. The film is about prejudice, male domination, state of art, value and most important heat. <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long history that has been edited well as the film length is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes he is an artistic film, the next five minutes a sad film, his next five minutes a thriller. He just keeps changing his attitude as his protagonist changes his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. History and script are impeccable. The actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists you can tell them how they did. Very impressive. It was not even named for Oscars. 'English Patriarch' this year received the Oscar the best film and the category of foreign films 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and the youngest 'English patient' said the best. See it 9/10.
