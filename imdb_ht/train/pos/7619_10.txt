Entrigan. Exciting. Drama. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the iceberg's tip in terms of the grand tale that is lost being said. <br /> From the acting down to the scarce visual effects, LOST is the essential TV show for fans of science -fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and many and many mysteries. <br /> Each member cast is so well-chosen, and so good in the roles, that you either love, or hate them, or outright wanting to die. The visual effects, when used (rare), are actually quite well considered the usual production of shows. Let's "smoke the monster", in the polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of candy eyes. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, nothing can be compared to the vast complexity of this show made by viewers like I'm scared. Starting at the end, continuity is virtually perfect, the characters developed, and the ever-evolving history slowly gives answers to its very longing questions. <br /> <br /> In general, there is virtually no flaw in LOST. He made for dramatic TVs / sci-fi who was arrested Development for comedy: he set the bar. <br /> I highly recommend patient, intellectual, and love every moment of the ride, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> Look at this show.
