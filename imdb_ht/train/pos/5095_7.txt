The King's King Salmon brought us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decided that it was time to return to England and become his father. He finds that his wife's parents took care of her son, and she has very little chance to get guards in her with lots of money for a lawsuit. In coming Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom at Elizabeth's map was sent to him. Elizabeth is looking out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. There is a good cast of support characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russia) who want the card too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a solidly honorable man who comes to the aid of the girl in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actress who can show passion, loss and despair, ruthlessly silent people, anger and strength; In Solomon's mind, her character actually smiled some times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relic alive-again, one of which does not have to let him jaw and be quite so strong. Perhaps a little dance would help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and worth the time to watch it.
