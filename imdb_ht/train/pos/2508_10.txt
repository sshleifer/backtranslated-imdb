This amazing movie. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> I was very surprised at Gackt's performance and the Hyde, after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and musicians who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this movie, a young Sho (Gackt) comes across a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an easy friendship. Kei suffers because of how it is forced to live on others, half the life of a vampire. <br /> It's a sad movie, but not bad. The plot was very unique, and contrary to recapturing your typical vampire. The scenario was thick and twisted and turned and very tense. <br /> <br /> The only fault I would say the movie was, despite its lack of a happy - supposedly peaceful ending, would be it in many languages. I had the undead version (I'm lucky that I understand it all saved some of the sideways), so I would recommend finding something with subtitles. <br /> In all, the movie was just awesome.
