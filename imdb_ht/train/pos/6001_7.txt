There is no denying a masterpiece, and far from Errol Flynn's best, Istanbul still has a lot to read. Locals and beautiful techniquesolor cinematography, bring us back to a long time since past. Errol Flynn shows moments of his glory, and it's OK as Jim Brennan, a recent pilot turned into haunting him. The photo is actually a remake of the 1947 "Singapore", and the story looks awfully converted and clich√© 'by today's standards. Also many of the support cast seems to be simply "going through the motions" in this picture. Many have also compared it to one of the greatest ever, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie, I could see a lot of similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for it's worth. In closing, if you're a fan of Flynn, or old fashioned love story, you might want to give this movie a look. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or the Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood's classic.
