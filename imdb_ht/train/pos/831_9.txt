I saw this movie while it was under limited release, especially for the gift to see Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen all year long. It starts out almost as a thriller, but gradually progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-maternity that with great comedy energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say this movie is a comedy, she does not forget she has a heart at times and can be very touchy when she needs to be. When I entered the theater I did not know what to expect more than a mustache, but that I got was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater I felt very much in the movie and I planned to see it again in diversity. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy and a script that is well written with a big whisk.
