Writer / Director John Hughes covers all bases (as usual) and this film is harassed-sweet "Sunday Afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet, preferable orphan, taking care of childhood by "Bill". The couple live in their blood while traveling the great U.S.A. Fate match with a "very beautiful" lawyer yuppie, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Kids will love this movie, as they can relate to the heroine, played by 9 year old Alison Poter (who went to be "you go the girl! "in Pepsi advertisement). The character is assumed to be approximately 6 or 7, as he asks to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is daily at 9 or more. <br /> Like "Home Alone", there are many slap-stick and little point punching large pieces of fat. Again, this is "formula" to make films, aimed at a young audience. Interesting and happy. Do not look for any surprises, but be prepared to sink a water or two.
