Man on Fire, is definitely one of the best drives / krill thrills I've ever seen. Despite having a slow start the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together quite well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a guard, called Creasy who suffers from his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his last protector , Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Later, very clever, enthusiastic girl who loves so many things, and acts in a very compelling way, she has a great future ahead of her. As I told the story a bit complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times. <br /> This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing wrong, everyone in just living life happily until kidnapping in Pita and Kreasy, is almost dead. Then there's the second part, the rest of the movie, where suddenly everything gets complicated and a bit horrible and disturbing, when the Kreasy recovers from his serious crash and begins to chase and kill the criminals many and "La Hermamdad" were responsible for the planning and execution of kidnapping in later. Denzel Washington shows us that it is up to date talent to act with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It's a real shame that this movie was not recognized enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even perhaps the visual effects were of high quality. <br /> <br /> If you love excellent, a little bother, suspense suspense, this is one of them to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this movie are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
