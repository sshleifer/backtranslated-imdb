There were some great moments in reality in having described modern day life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how stifling their culture can and wants to break out of the mold it created for you. The dance was just a car saying "do what you love even though it's against the norm". Instead, Billy Elliot as I might say. I also enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the left between Sugiyama and his wife, emotionally in the dance hall. I liked Aoki - with that wig and excesses on the dance floor to make me plain plain! <br /> <br /> The actors all made a wonderful work, the story was well written. I watched her a second time and kept some little nuances that I missed on the first look. Good entertainment!
