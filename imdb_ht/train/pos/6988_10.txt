This is one movie that will take time to get out of mind once you've seen it. The dialogues are near perfect, which should be expected as it fits from a play. The actors simply give their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes to the most beautiful! <br /> Yvan Attal is totally credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still beautiful (but not so dirty) blonde gives much pleasure in their eyes as in their ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is giving an excellent appetite of total jerk (and proud to be such), and Marina Fois is the mute friend who always blonds when you expect it less. Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates to adapt this excellent game, with all the best for future production! <br /> I wish there were more of these in production nowadays. If you like it, you'll also enjoy: "In the Time of Familiar," and "Cuisine And Addiction". Both were written and played by the Bacri / Jaoui couple.
