Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credit runs on the screen. I soon find out that Florence Rice was, A real beauty that came to a merely wonderful performance. As they all do in this piece of entertaining ensemble. From 1939, it's a different time, but in that it lies the charm. It transports you to another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then gets very serious. Florence Rice runs gamers in heroine comedy. It is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable to being from a girl in a woman. See her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made about forty cinemas, and I'm going to look for the other nine. Alan Marshal is in the Flynn / Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and UNA Merkel give some excellent moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of the 30's / 40's movies, do not miss this one!
