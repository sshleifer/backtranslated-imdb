It started out slowing after an excellent animated intro, as the director had a bunch of characters and school settings developed. Once the bet is over, though, the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain amount of glass can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullies, helping others, mind about subjects when you do not want to do something. <br /> <br /> In special note is the girl who plays Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. Mom principal sneaks him in unexpectedly, and when he is on his screen is fascinating. He is one of those "Hey, she looks familiar" faces, and then I remembered she was the girl who Pepsi featured about 8 years ago. It was also in "Paulie", which is the film of the parrot who tries to find his way home. Eisenberg has made many TVs and films at '99 -00, but then has not seen so much for the next few years. It's now 14 and is growing to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warm up the screen. If he can find some more good roles he might have as a good career (or better?) Pass Haley Joel Osment, another three actress called kid, but hopefully without some of the issues Osment was in recently. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 son, who just finished reading the story, the movie did not seem to follow the book all that well, but it was fun not the less. The movie movie seemed like a great setup for some suites (How to Eat the Burning Jar? The kid's escargot style?), Which might not be such a bad thing. It was good for the family to take a movie and not to worry about language, violence, or sex scenes. Another good aspect of the movie was the respect / fear that was announced by the Baldock Director (Boilerplate). Movies nowadays tend to show faces of senior officials as buffalo. While he had one particular goofy scene, he directed the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work.
