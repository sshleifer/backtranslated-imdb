Fantastic documentary in 1924. The early 20th century early geography of Iraq today was powerful. See this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take note before making the Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably shaved while filming the remarkable landscapes of this movie. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this movie to be a treasure, and heartbreaking history of struggles, complimented by the land around them, never has the human ability to endure so obvious. The fact that this was done when he showed not only the wishes of the subjects, but in the filmmakers themselves.
