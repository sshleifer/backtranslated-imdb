I work with children from 0? 6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they start singing, "We are the Doodlebops We are the Doodlebops We are the Doodlebops Oh come and join the fun because we're laughing and we're singing all day" it's almost impossible to join them in singing. Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun.Each show is an adventure, the Doodlebops do not try to change the world and preach messages that all make it fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child can have reports. The Doodlebops are a refreshing alternative, high for regular children's TV programs.
