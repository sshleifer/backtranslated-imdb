Many and lots of information is digested, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his speed. <br /> Also if you have not seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc, you'll be a bit lost. <br /> <br /> And list the movie long. Directors include Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wildlife, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and the Conversation (Coppola) Segway Movie Star, Star Wars: Episode III, Matrix ... but these I suspect are apart. For sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or if you are) analgesic to the psycho, then you will be annoyed by no end. <br /> But you should not, like the environment, clips, the movie way interleave with these clips, Zizek's point is never boring.
