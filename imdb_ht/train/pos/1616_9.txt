Deliriously romantic comedy and subtle glittering is very mischievous with actors who bouncing lines of each other with precise comic distributions, a nice feat to see. When Cher's despair wife asked her to help her make peace with her alien, Moody little brother, no one could dream the consequences that follow. Symbolic operators, confession of the Catholic Church, love bites and snow fall ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to rhythm the picture of the kicker (there is an early sequence with the grandfather and his dog in the cemetery of a little rough, with a scene with Cosmo and the senior man at the gate which seems obtuse), but the plank of the plot is confused with nimble skill, and tone of the film manure and kooky spirits are both infectious. *** 1/2 from ****
