I do not understand your objection in this movie. It is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created by "Instrumental Instruments". The only part of the story is the least unrealistic bit, is the fact that Sharon Stone's characters are still alive and are not jailed at that late date. <br /> <br /> featuring three theories of what is happening: 1) Sharon Stone's characters are killing all of these because of crazy (Addicted Risks); 2) David Thewolf 'crooked cop will kill those people in character Character characters Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst will kill those people for revenge. What encroaches most people on the film seems to be that none of these theories ever explain as the "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care center to kill the cop; the only killing occurs on screen.) I think this is a brilliant tracing device in the spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey." WHO WHAT ARE REYNOLDS? The really crazy bladder, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants to revenge. What matters is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone who thinks of reality is more complicated than a movie. Get on it!
