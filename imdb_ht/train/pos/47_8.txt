It breaks my heart that this movie does not appreciate how it should be. its very disadvantageous. Those who forget what the movies really are, nowadays they think only about Boom Boom movies, which can be fun with popcorn and friends, such as transformers, movies that are oriented, and hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher, on special effects only with which is dumb movies without scenario. It's kind of a movie that I am most. Of course it is fun looking very much to make CGIs, but we do not find anything essential in what kind of movies. <br /> <br /> I honestly think that performance was excellent. Especially busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this movie an Oscar worth. Emotional performance by occupying Philipps was amazing, as a shame we will see Oscar in his hand, which he deserves.
