If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, with any sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of materials very absorbed in this film. It probably was originally a play, and that's why it's heavy dialogue, but I can not stress enough how these icons that we only have a deep understanding of made of really complex and wonderful characters. Movie is better than any college course to tell you how to create a character-driven story
