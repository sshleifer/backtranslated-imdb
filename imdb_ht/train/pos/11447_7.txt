This movie is probably yours. She has a general meditation of the music, the beautiful photography, and listening to things that are often clich√© about the lives that Andy Goldsworthy said she worked or in between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhist- that's the sort of sense I got from this movie. Disappointment of life, beauty of nature, interconnectedness of everything, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused, and finally forced me to leave without ending (I saw about an hour in it) was the redundancy of everything. You only get bits and pieces of why it's commissioned, and how it can even pay live to this kind of job. The artwork comes alive, but all of its words have no conclusion lead to dead end.
