Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. By surviving the government's elective securities, it has given him a choice either for electronics to a greater degree or to agree with some experience. He chooses the experimentation and is placed in a large metallic cell and a criminal offense that has also survived the electrochemistry. They can also have the desired place in the room (of reason), but they can not leave. After a few days they eat down to one single per day and the room temperature is set to over 100. After some more alarms are sounding at intervals so they can not sleep. One day a 'witch' enters the cells (albeit a glass cut portion) What happens next I'll let you get out. I can of the minority here but I liked the build, it was my intriguing. Now, if the settlement was half as good as the build I would have rated this higher. <br /> <br /> Media Blaster 2 DVD Set Extras: Disc 1) Cut the Director; Trailer for "Versus", "Aragami", "Gas Station Attack", and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theater Cutting; Comments and Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview with crew; Make of; Original trailer; and promo ads
