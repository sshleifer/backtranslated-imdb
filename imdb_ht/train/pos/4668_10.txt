This film is now appearing on digital television at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or more times, and it never stopped to have fun. If it was the next day I would have to look at it again. These are the artistic styles of Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the acting profession can create, helped in no small way by superb trio supported by Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Remember others in minor roles. It's a simple story, simply said, in a former con, an adorable embezzler, fighting and succeeding and then "new tech tech" means computer and find affection in the process. Though it is a tad (tongue in a blow) plausible, even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all there are no terrible methods that are so prevalent today. A real lesson for modern movie-makers on how to make a great show, and with, virtually nothing ... except exceptional talent.
