If you did not see Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wife" then you are missing out. Eva will be one of the biggest stars in the Latina and you will see her in the theater soon. This was Eva's first movie and she performed a fantastic job. She was 24 when she shot her and looked hot then. As for this low budget film, it is very good for the first time the director, who has another soon to be released movie "Juarez, Mexico" now playing film festival across the United States. In fact, it appears that it can have a limited release release from some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
