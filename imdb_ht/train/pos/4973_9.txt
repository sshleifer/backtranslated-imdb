I remember watching this original original in 1962 as a five year or six year old and really enjoying this. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since then, as it was revealed on "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I would forget most of it, and some of it was geared toward the kids, but it was always enjoyable. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephew.
