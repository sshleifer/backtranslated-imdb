If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic movie or one with a strong and credible plot, then this movie is NOT for you. Nope - you will hate it. However, for those who love sweet, komed a little vicious, then you will have a nice time watching this small movie. <br /> Tony Randall is working for the IRS and investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needs to file a return on income tax. However difficult it is trying to convince them of the gravity of his visit, all of the family is thrilled to have companies. They are scrubbed on him and treated him as one of the family, ... and they plan to find him hitched their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plots there. But the movie gets high marks for a fun and decent acting script. A really cute little curry from the late 1950s.
