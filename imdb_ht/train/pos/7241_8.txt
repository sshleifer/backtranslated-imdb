Paul Lukas has played a Russian intellectual to make him live as a waiter in "Grand Slam," directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire in the building up of celebrities. The man and girl's Russian restaurant hat played by Loretta Young to America's sweethearts as a bridge partner with no squabble. With the help of publishers and McCain's ghost-writers (beautiful Frank McHugh bites) they become advertising markets <br /> <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system," a "system" in the offer whichever one feels like <ou There is no reason for rigging.) <br /> A duel and moving moves to Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? and I suspect the character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a slam to another kind of system), a wealthy plumber played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across America as a prize fighting by Roscoe Karns (another big rapier talking funny actors in the 1930s). The same bridge bridges in a roped-off square, even though the audience is <br /> <br /> above, unlike the "ring" box. <br /> <br /> Variety of varieties of Americans prefigures the comedies of Preston sturges, though for manufacturing celebrities, "Grand Slam" most appeals to the idea of ​​the best cinema of the same era (pre-code) and Lee Tracy play fast-talking <br /> <br /> publicist: "The Naked Half Naked" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has its <br /> moment, especially for anyone who has played bridges and points serious <br /> <br /> counters. Loretta Young was already a horse dress. (For me, her face looks a bit long <br /> and horsey, too. Noting another era of beauty, I guess ...) the movie <br /> unfortunately all but gorgeous Farrell drops, which plays McHugh's forgotten <br /> <br /> girlfriend.
