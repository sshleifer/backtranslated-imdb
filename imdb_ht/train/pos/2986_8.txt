I'm surprised to see even one-dude criticizing this old movie. We do not normally get good opera movie, and here's a true true surgery. Understandable, the visuals are not great. It's dated. But as operas it can not be flawed; and I'm an opera scrub. I can not even detect one lip-five; if we did not know that the Tebaldi had nothing audio would convince me is not Sophia Loren. It does everything with Flair! Her black makeup is fine; and it brings the role of gorgeous life! The rest of the cast is wonderful, as is that stunning ballet troupe. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren is really wonderful. His rival Amneris is also terrific. Anyone who did not care for this 1953 job is to blame remittances. Verdi would like it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I like this old movie!
