All my favorite movie ever. Oscar-caliber works by everyone involved, both in front and behind the camera. The scenario is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfied way, unlike the novel. The care and the other leading characters are a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have Oscars for director Mike Newell and Cinematographer Rex Maidment. Josie Lawrence's best work is near, and transforms my opinion into Joan Plowright. Having watch this movie at least 50 times, I can find any fault in it. The music, not renowned composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a wonder.
