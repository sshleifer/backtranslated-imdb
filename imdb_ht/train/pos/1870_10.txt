This movie is great! It touches my heart cold. I could not relate to the racial discrimination that Elder has experienced because I live in my own country. I thought it was really hard to discriminate. We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University, and I did not know that it was a true story, I thought it was just created by an intellectual who wants to bring a fresh air into the industry. It is very good. The part that shocked me was Nadine abusing anchored (just six) sexually. If I was on his shoes, I could fly a high-rise building high story. I salute him for being very strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touches me here is when Andron finally sees her mother Eve face to face. He did not bitch him or whatever, rather he told him about the achievements that he had received over the years that they had been separated. (I think I'll do that when I get the chance to draw my roots.)
