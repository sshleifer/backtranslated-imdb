Fudge a very odd movie. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /> <br /> First I thought after watching, how was the hell going to walk this stuff? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombie, Fido is a boy and dog dog entrusted with fifty comedy nostalgia and zombies. Not exactly trip to the language. <br /> Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. It's a different animal altogether (forgiving the basket). Fido kicks off with a black and white information film that explains the story back - people had a war against zombies by developing a subtle control of the subtle meat-dining domestically. <br /> At first I thought we were in for a cold parody parody smoker in a martini, but we are soon dropping into a world of bright colors and fifty soldiers - class nostalgia. Young Timmy Robinon is a kid who does not fit into the school. Her mother is ta-climber social, and her dad is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Find the Joneses, the mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is not interested in the first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves to be a good friend for Jimmy. Until her necklace goes on the stick ... <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie will figure out exactly what it is. Humor is in the variety of family lights, and sometimes the drawn line is too heavy depending on the boy and his dog / family moments. But the film is shot in and beautiful black, really funny, while being welcomed, will ensure a R rating for what, for extended periods, a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie looks gorgeous, and it is nice to do not all involved. Its difficult problem, I hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a bit gem in this year's Deluge of Cinematic Crap.
