Tony Hawk Underground came to a point where the series really started to lose its glamor, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series which should be different and interesting. <br /> Underground featuring the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro skater fans. Another feature featuring very attractive fans to discuss and what could be found in the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually ride, run and do all kinds of new stuff. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and was the length of the level drawings. The first two games for the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long with some hidden features of some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed their system to their limitations. In this version, they reduce these features, not as many as demanding the streets, in fact there are almost none of the few levels, and the graphics and artistic tones are down a little, but not a lot . > <br /> This game has only one, the storymode is a little short, of course this is Neversoft first time doing this with Tony Hawk Pro skater, so that is understandable. However, with being told you will definitely finish this game in a day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition was very refreshing.
