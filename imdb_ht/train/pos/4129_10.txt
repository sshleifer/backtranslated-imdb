It is a show competition for cooking, Americans. It will not make the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity set to the dishes by the chef of the jump president. Surely a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> You can criticize the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's fun enough to look and generally the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and i'm bitter Jan Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> Happy Cuisine!
