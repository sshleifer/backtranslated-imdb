My very favorite characters in films, but in almost all of them the character of Zorro has a small piece of cloth like a mask, and if the villain `can not tell who is under that cloth then they Daft. <br /> But at Reed Hadley `s" Zorro's Fighting Fighting "(1939 series) the mask full of his whole face makes it a real mystery as to which Zorro really is. <br /> But anyway Zorro is one of the best characters in films and brings it up to date I think Anthony Hopkins in the "Zorro Mask" (1998) is a fun .My concern in film is vast , but it has a real sympathy for the sixth series in the 30s / 40s .... <br /> Bond2a
