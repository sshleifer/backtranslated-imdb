This Hong Kong packboiler package packs more melodrama than worth the week of the 'Young and the Blood'. This one is more of an original throwback 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a Amy Amato Amy. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) underwent a stunning transformation into street-to-street street nurse. Future Italian porn star / politician, Illona Staller, who would later go on behalf of the Ciccolina (and sex with a positive HIV John Holmes) play Emy's competition. Exotic locations and some soft-core scenes round one this out. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', in which I am one!
