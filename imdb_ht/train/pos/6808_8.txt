The cold blood of 1967 was perhaps more like the "real thing" (Think about it: we would really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a color world, and a lot of people did not even know what it was, and had an opportunity to notice it for television. Plus, if you notice it, you can show some things not shown in the original. The Book of Blood Cold by Truman Capote was the first "novel of nonfiction". Truman's book was in fact not 100% true in the real story. I thought the Canadian site was pretty much for Kansas for a TV movie. Look for the elements of gender, drugs and rock 'n' roll: dick's educator, Perry being a junkie aspirin, Perry playing guitar blues.
