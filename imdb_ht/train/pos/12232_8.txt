As a collector of film memorabilia, I bought the movie poster for this film that, now that I've finally seen it, had to be the best thing about it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man. However, there is nothing more horrible to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long images of the melting man. At first I thought this movie was garbage pies, but then I realized that it had some kind of to make me laugh. Character Doctor Ted Nelson has to be the most personalized perspective of personally carried out in the big screen. His dialogue is so trite it to incredible! ("It's incredible! It seems it's getting bigger!" And somebody could tell me how exotics know exactly how long Steve left before it completely dissolved and exactly what this plan is for "help" him? If this film meant scary audience, I think he missed his appeal.
