I was accountant of the producer on this movie, and I also made some voice-on work on it, so I'm not totally fair, but if it was awful, I would say that. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critical acclaimed masterpiece, by any means, but there was plenty of laughter on the road. The Bible says that laughs are good as a medicine, so watch this movie can be good for your health. <br /> So many of the actors in this picture have not yet reached their peak at the time we made this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one that has since gone on to fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on television on a weekly basis as a photographer of the TV series "Thirty-One". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, always haunting people in dreams. One of my favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. It was an excellent actress comedian, and a really nice, sincere people. We all had fun working on this show, and I think fun comes in.
