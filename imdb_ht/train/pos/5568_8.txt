A typical cellar of Cheech and Chong facts including drugs, songs, more drugs, cars and drives, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, up comedy, amazing drugs and coke space !! It's not as coherent or compelling as the smoke rises but it's still incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, including the opening scene where they get some fuel for the cars and the drive to work. Also funny is the Cheech Song (Mexican-American) and the Chong follow up songs. Another remarkable scene is the social welfare scene with Jones (human noise machine), from the Police Academy series, and the old man laughing. All in all, this is a great follow up up of smoke and is quite watchable when moderate or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
