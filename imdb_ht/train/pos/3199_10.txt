OK, I do not really think Boy Trailer Park has bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just ... conflict with each other. For example: Near the end of the movie, she shows Ricky and Julian saying "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and walk away. Then, in the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying they were in jail for 2 years. In the TV set pilot, the first clip to show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian called "Patrick Lewis". But in the television series, supposedly only been imprisoned for 18 months. <br /> <br /> Also, we give you the impression that the movie's storyline line and TV series story lines are connected (because of the screaming scene between the guys). But some actors show totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then plays Sam Losco in the series. Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking. The thing is, they never actually confirm that the story lines are connected to anyway, other than the crying scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep on blabbing.
