Another classic study of the wealth of a southern family is the mastery of Writing on the Wind. Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an aircraft, or its name. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always got her out of trouble. Mitch finished college, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch does not come from a wealthy home. Kyle's family, and Hadley oil, control most of everything in the city. While in N.Y., Kyle meets the girl in her dreams, nicely played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlpool romance, she got married and brought her home. There he meets his bophie in warning him how difficult Kyle can. Kyle slept with a gun under his pillow. Bacall's character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a hog if ever there, played by Dorothy Malone, who has been the best actress to support. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. br> <br /> A year of bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle was told by the doctor that he can not have the kids. It is when her wife reveals to her that she's really pregnant, Kyle, thinking that the child is Mitch, goes on a drunken frenzy and she accidentally shot dead in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who still loves Mitch, tries, but is unsuccessful to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable court scene, Malone pulled all the stops to finally admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. His Oscar was well deserved. Robert Stack, surprisingly like Kyle Hadley, was nominated for the best actors to support and lose in an angry victory by Anthony Quinn, as Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. br> <br /> Douglas Circus was the master of soap opera films in the 1950s. Writing on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
