Now this is what a family movie should be! Some films in recent years have been targeted at families or children who are truly worthy of watching public; but this is one of them. All my family was away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzling, and happy. We always quoted a little anecdote in it here and there. The kids loved it and so we (hubbie and i are 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from the beautiful animation and its hit, the characters (bit, and imaginable as they are) are very well developed. None of them that you can not empathize with. The personalities bring these little creatures into their lives properly cast talent, combined with the skill and artisticness of some of Disney's best entertainers. This is a worthy movie for Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney would approve the film of this new movie ... Flick, Dot and fellow heroes of small heroes can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is one of the family left the theater wants to see again .. and buy owns on video or DVD. I want to see him again .. pick up what I might miss the first time. (I never saw my children quickly and clearly identified and embraced previous characters ... My daughter constantly talked about little "dot".) This movie is funny, heartwarming, smart and fun for all family!
