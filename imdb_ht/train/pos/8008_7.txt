As far as I know, this show has never been repeated on UK television after its original run of late 70s / early '70, and most episodes are now sadly "missing presumed wiped". from 1971 however still exist in its entirety, and I recently had the chance to watch it all, the best part of 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After your home noise from the school, Freewheelers was essential to look for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of pants started, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watch it again to carry a single nostalgic neck in the throat. <br /> Never mind the bad action, the unintentionally funny scenes, wide plot pits enough to pilot a big sea off of the yacht and RADA's "frightfully, frightfully" accent to the lead players. <br /> No - forget all that. Because Freewheelers has turned back to a forgone (dare I say "gold") the age of children's TV dramas, when the shows were simply about fun RIP-Roaring and did not take it seriously. Before being overwhelmed with all of the bitter "ishoos" that screenwriters today have protruding cold weather, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, spark etc. <br /> No doubt if it was "redone for a modern hearing" In the days of all-ubiquitous policy correctly, the boss face would be a black girl, one of the young men heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a white boy confused about his sexuality and girl The should be a go-getter all-action with an IQ on the scale, who should forever get the boys out of scratch and make them look foolish - in other words a million miles removed from Wendy Padbury's deference, the upper-legged chevrolet machine. <br /> It's a show that's very "in its time". But is it wrong? I do not think so.
