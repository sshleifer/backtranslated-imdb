I said the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and had a jacket. Then, when all the men were in camp, it turned out there was a character that seemed to Bill Paxson, but it was not. I told the location of Bill Paxson? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said it was 21. This was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the most memorable camp director (Alan Arkin). Later, this girl was interacting and talking about her camp experience. This made no sense. It would be one year old. That said, the movie turned out to be very good. Kevin Pollak was the lovely guy who was still being teased. A guy was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his lovely girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admitted that he grew out of touch with modern youth. The best part was that none of the grown-up farmers were successful in their lives. None of them have a lot of careers. This seemed very real life. The movie was compared to the Big Chill. In some ways it was not as interesting as the Big Chill, but it was a lot more realistic. So even if the start is not promising, the film ended up turning into a very good one.
