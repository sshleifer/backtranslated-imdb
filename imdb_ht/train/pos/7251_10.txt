I saw this movie only one time over 25 years ago, and that day I always said that he is probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue I had to find the movie to be enthralling and I even found myself holding my breath so no sound. I would highly recommend this movie and wish it was available on DVD.
