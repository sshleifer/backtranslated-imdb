I saw this film without knowing what was ... I'm a Branagh fan, even more his Shakespeare movie, and, from the beginning, I've seen it just for that ... and I end with tears in my eyes, because great, great serenity, value, affects and brave philosophy on life of Helena's girl. Recommended to those who are bored with TV programs (in Spain, at least).
