The plus bomb explosion scene is very real. <br /> <br /> What do you read and teach just do not happen !!! <br /> Has increased your BP level by 10% <br /> <br /> All actors have played their role very well. <br /> There are some scenes that can be avoided including adolescents. This film is quite adult in nature. /> <br /> Not a movie that can be seen with family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
