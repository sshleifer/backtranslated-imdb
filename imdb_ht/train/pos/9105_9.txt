Women never looked so attractive and pathetic as in the film Piedras Salazar. Although the editor cuts here and there can help the movie, it is interesting and enjoyable with an intense brand from Pedro Almodovar's latest film. 5 different women will survive with their male partners and their families. Starting with several different tidal stories to meet as the plot goes on, Salazar portrays his female character in the same neurotic and boundary-lane behavior of familiar to Almodovar. A key key kleptomaniac society with a fattish on smaller footwear, a housewife home burlesque cares for her disabled daughter, a drug addictive drug obsessed with her former companion and a taxi-driver taking care of late-born children his, all roaming the streets of Madrid in well-performing scenes. Using some of the familiar actress Almodovar, the director succeeds in his first film to provide depth of all the characters to share the movie, and to create genuine sympathy with each of them. Women are controlling the drawn line, and the men are bound to be left with each other, eventually ... Amazingly good for a movie first, and worth the time of any standard. It is apparent that Salazar hesitates in some guides that are needed to actresses, but it is an impressive act to show anyway on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who plays in his short film film. <br /> A must of all Almodovar's fans, and enjoyable at all.
