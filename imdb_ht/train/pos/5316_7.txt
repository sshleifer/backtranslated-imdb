This is the second film I saw in Ida Lupino as a director after 53 in the hitch hitch. I think this one was a better movie then that one. This one has a girl who is going to marry and is then sexually attacked and does not like everyone looking and talking about it to run away and was taken by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
