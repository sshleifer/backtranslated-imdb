This is a fine drama and a nice change at the pace of more agitated and loud movie today. It's another based-a-true store, which always means much of it might make up for dramatic reasons. Frankly, I do not know but I love the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man back in fifty soldiers who become interested in rocketry and wants to enter this field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else, like his father, , do this in this city of West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think has been prevented. I would like to have a little less strain between the two. The boy is still a boy, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first fixing duties, I think. It is unmatched, as the schools are browsing here. It is good to see beautiful children in a modern-day movie. Two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (Dad) and Laura Dern (kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.) The cinema is decent band in the 1950s is fun to hear. Again: I wish there are more of these kinds of films made today.
