This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's ... terrible. But it is so good! It's probably best if you do not expect it to expect an entertaining draw and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro hair / bad hair, you're in for a real treat. The harder you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a competition to spot the most drawn holes / ups, in this case you had hours of entertainment ahead. I would only really recommend this movie for the boredom or the Dead-Hard Smack fans. And even then, the letter would be a bit of attention, because Japanese Goro's fans were a bit upset about it, they thought it had sold itself out. (It was not really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do this for him).
