"Yokai Daisenso" is a child's film by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & ​​scary for the least. However, older children can properly eat this, that is, if you play it armed in English. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a young boy, who moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. During a small festival the boy is chosen as a "Kirin Rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes many dangers and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil ones are in hand as a woman in a mini white skirt, go-go boots & a hair-do-weh, team up with a wrong Yokai to turn resentment of people and articles abandoning their accounts. And this evil manifests itself as a city flying in the form of a monster that heads the city to rage itself, Tokyo. A very funny scene has two drugs watching the monster flying over the city ... says one, "Oh, it's just Gamera". <br /> <br /> The boy was befriended Yokai, which is monsters of a kind, especially benign, isolated from people, and the whole Yokai of Japan band together to fight the evil. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & the crew have taken the end / 60's film in Yokai movie early and turned them into a modern adventure movie for kids (older) who also combine some strange mechanical monsters which made me think of "transformers". The look and feel of the movie is great, the fun effects, and some of the humor will just sail right on the kid's head, but still, older people might enjoy it. As for adults, there is not much here not to love, if you're a fan of your Japanese monster movies you will enjoy the heck out of this. <br /> <br /> Cool & Fun stuff, kind of dark at times but maybe that's just Miike .. and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
