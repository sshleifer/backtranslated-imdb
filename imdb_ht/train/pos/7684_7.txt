Reading all the comments is very interesting. but it may be someone to tell me the name of the real artist who painted the photos for the time of the broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist of the family but there was a real family that has the real artist, and has not gotten any credit in this front again. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of real artist I would also like to tell him "work well". I know this Sight is for those good times cast, but you do not agree that it also touches the hearts of all of us. I would like to know if it is still painted or, if it is still alive. I would like to have some of her work appearing in my home.
