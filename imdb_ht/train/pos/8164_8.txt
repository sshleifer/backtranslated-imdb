This movie was very enjoyable, though you will only love it if: - you hate going to the dentist, but do not be afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love movie movies <br /> <br / > I particularly liked the fact that they gave some care to explain the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he was totally obsessed by cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then catching his wife gives some fun oral to the mud-pool pool is a very reasonable belief beliefs to go further. . I give it a 8.
