I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it haunted me since. <br /> One sequel particularly stayed in mind, and could only be fashioned by a great director, as Michael Cacoyanis undoubtedly is. <br /> <br /> The context: The weight of history and a warrior army and fleet all lay on King Agamemnon's shoulder. A sacred act was supposed to be the sea, threatening its expedition to Troy. He said he should sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia Apollo in order to find the winds for the veils of the Thousands Boats. He initially resisted, but comes around, and his wife Clytemenstra tricks carry their daughter to the Greek camp in order to marry the eldest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, find information about sacrifices, and rage of the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, Achilles is proud to discover that his name was used in this fake way, disarmament. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect it. <br /> <br /> The shot: The circle camera of young people, without looking directly to each other. They shine their fate, and the weakness of those who deceive their loved ones and the lust for war. At the same time, they are contemplating each other, and, for a moment, we feel both the power and beauty, and the instore - except by camera - irony that at other times, elsewhere, maybe could love with each other and be married. It is a sharp and sad epiphany lasting only for a moment. <br /> Which direction! Which camera? What storytelling!
