There is no sense of the story since the appraiser enough did so. Here is a little different hanging on it in one of these "black nuns," as a bigoted review put it so tolerant. <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps classic examples ever to put on the movie how women can manipulate men and gender. There is a lot of truth that Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look nice, sting eyebrows, offer your body for free ..... and men will fall on their heads to help you out and whatever you want. > <br /> In that case, it was the beginning of work with the ultimate goal of money ..... much of it. At least four people in this film give only that, even if it breaks their lives in the process. <br /> 2) Finish - which many of the reviews here seemed to hate - gave another big message: all the money and goods in the world will not make someone feel fulfilled. A sad comment that many "critics" here would prefer to have immoral messages, preferring to sleep on substance. No surprise, I guess. <br /> Either way you look at it, the movie is fun start-up and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly at the start when it says to his father unruly customers to give up. In a little over 70 minutes, this movie moves in a fast and it's about before you know it.
