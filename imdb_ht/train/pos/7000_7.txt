When I first saw the title I had already deduced the theme of the movie - it's clear was not a reference to British money, so it was to be Shakespearian and on body books - take them, or give them. Will Smith is a charming actor, so the serious assassins came out. It could only be a bargain, so to be somehow guilty. I spoil everything for myself by watching it and knowing the story before I look, as the beauty of the build-up is the parts of the main character to drip the foods to slowly grow the audience as to whom it is and why he does what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Feeling a very difficult subject is simply because it's deeply comfortable and sad, which is not a site encouraging when waiting for a roller coaster roller - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say the movie glorified suicide; it delves in the most extreme form of self sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> It's also exuberant with symbols everywhere, which is a tell-story-telling storyfull written sign of great thought and leads to multiple meanings and a deep reflection nature. The most important thing that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but he gave it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan to call again does not fall in love - what a hassle of 2nd act. Absolutely mastery .. Yes it's very slow-paced, but I am sure it would be best to delay at a smaller timeframe. I did not feel the strain with her terrible inner torment as much as I could have, but maybe that's just I've lost it for myself in advance. Saying all that, though, it is a deeply moving and original movie that is an incredibly powerful and think-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.
