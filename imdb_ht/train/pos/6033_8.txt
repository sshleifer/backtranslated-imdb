I would just like to point out that this can be partial, as I'm a producer on the movie. However, I'll keep some sense of dignity. The star of the movie, Oscar Ovies, provides a stellar performance as Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish ipokondriak who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him, by stating himself often and with a sense of comedy hard. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant support beam, which without, it would be confusing about himself. Her friends also borrowed a hand in Jeff's life, often making choices for her rather than leaving her using her free will ... that often times she is neglected to be there. The report is superb, and the conversations are flowing like scenes from a movie by Kevin Smith, and many Ben Affleck boo-hoo fests. <br /> <br /> The camera work is a little shoddy at some point, and the sound might also use an increase, however their performance comes out to light the minor details. It is also backed by a beautiful band with local talents and an outstanding composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a treat. A rare gem, among many jewelry.
