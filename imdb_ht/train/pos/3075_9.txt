A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like the party of a neurotic sex object, but does not have the chops to work with him at the script called for. But it is like a good actor that he plays down to the level of performing stage performances. I applaud the filing of Tracey Ullman as the wife neglected. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. His way of moving makes his character look higher (and even smaller in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Macy's time in the only situation in which her character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery.
