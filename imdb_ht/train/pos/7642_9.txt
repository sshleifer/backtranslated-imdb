Not really a big box office draw, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> and this movie. James "I've done some things for Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-writing and directing this movie on an ordinary, average guy <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows who thinks His life was <br /> incredibly different if he hit a homerun in a key baseball game <br /> when he was 15. But thanks to mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry gets it right, but soon realizes that his new life <br /> is not exactly as expected. <br /> I must say, this movie really impressed me. The criticisms given <br /> mix, and I must say the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> pull well. Yes, it's a little standard, but pack enough <br /> funny moments, drama and excellent acting to make it really <br /> <br /> good. James Belushi (I think) Oscar was worthy of his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, with Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shining in their role role. Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender. It's <br /> just a good movie and a good lesson. If you have never seen, I <br /> highly recommended you check
