I still love it though. Warren Beatty is just just as the comic book hero. What saved this movie is the series, thrown in incredible and it cuts a single clone. I really expect something more important to the terms of action, or draw but I got so much. The main reason to watch this movie is to look at some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time of such a strange movie. <br /> <br /> One man who did a terrible job and did not even belong to this movie was Madonna. He did not belong to this movie and his acting job was very bad. The movie at some point just stood still. You expect something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad tip and does it very well. He and Beatty make a good guy good and bad guys. <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman, and Warren Beatty in a movie other than Isthar. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is good, but it could be so much better. I love it as a child because I thought it looked cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is just fair, and these cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> I particularly thought the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for these grand scale movie I just thought he might have ended up with a little more of a bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The movie only uses the 7 comic books to make it all that is excellent visually anyway. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeups were damaged as well. The facial makeup for bandits was great. Beatty is just not up to such a bigger life character. Still, this is a good movie that might have been much more. It is me better than Batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out close at the same time. Of course this movie was bigger in terms of gross.
