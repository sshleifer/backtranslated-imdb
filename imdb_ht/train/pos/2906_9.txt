A hilarious Action Comedy in which Damian Szifron takes in the lives of Díaz, a cop who has his wife cheated on her. He lives in a hotel feeling guilty of his wife's failures, falls into depression and stops caring, runs light red for fun, feels sorry for himself. With Silberman, a Jewish retreat on probation, a left liberal who does not trust the cops all. He said they accompanied Díaz in his daily duties, unable to deny due to the conditions of his probation. Soon the situation returns when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, someone he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear scheme, stealing cars, international spyware, a hysterical wife. Strange characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and courage.
