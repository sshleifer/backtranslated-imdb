Normally, I do not watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all very similar. This film has many stereotyped movie scenes, but the characters and originality of the movie cited made it easier to watch. David Duchovny lowered his normal approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and did a great act. Greatly cast all together. A must see for those bored and even films of old actions.
