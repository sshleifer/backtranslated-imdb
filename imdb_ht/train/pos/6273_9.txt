I really like this movie, yes, I know it was fairly far sought, there is no way that Shelby car could manage to stay on the road as well as the 540i and all it's in control of traction and other gizmos but other than all the films were well put together. Cages were excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also very good with the exception of the Guy Guy bad, it was a little too "too" many do you think? Anyway, big movie, great cars and acting. I for one assured that my car was locked and scared in my remote parking control this night. :)
