I felt it was necessary to respond to comments posted on this page's front page page because some of it was a little misinformative. Original I've posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was appropriate to give this the "comment" the index and not a message board (though we used to use that em which way back before IMDb was add movie message boards) so I'll modify this to make it necessary. <br /> Well, first of all you can not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin movie "panorama", she wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the role of "two shoes" she played in most of her films (excluding "Myself and My Gal"). Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to build a new story set in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway though Warners was outbid MGM for the rights of "Pal Joey." In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a wreck, though Sinatra was inappropriate for the role, but other problems shed the film (script change and poor direction ============ == ===================================== <br /> You complain about Kelly's photo Not quite well, even citing your art education proves the point. But you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story / character .. The pictures are to be Wrong, the audience knows that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition. Even he knows, even if Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes it. But it's important that the audience should not sit down there saying "But he's a great artist, if he only had the chance!" You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficits. Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show; again you Does not understand the structure of the story It denies because it does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he's not really ready for exhibition "His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not like the great enthusiasm" Joey "to" start a nightclub ". But it serves the same function of the plot. Remember, it's essential to "Pal Joey" (the game) that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he does not deserve it. Even with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were actually good, it would have mined this entire point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I guess it's the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should, but for me it was fine. Compare it to even worse "forcing" romance like one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in the "Pride and Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the great dance final has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it just shows that you do not dig under the surface of the movie of its symbols. Many elements of the dance sequence relate to the story and character, and in the conspiracy dance to resolve in images and symbols. She's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (she looks around and loves her away). The movements of the symphony are constructed for the part of every dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you did not see it, it's not the movie's fault. It certainly is not a "load of crap". ==================================================
