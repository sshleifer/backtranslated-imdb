For what it is, "Asking Victor Vargas" is about as close to perfection as a movie can be found. Either absolute genius from a jet writer or just one of those who mixes luck where everything clicks (probably some of each), this simple little slick-of-urban-life ethnic first likes flicking meat from her young character And the depths you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong taste in "street", but its work in a Latino family affair and then focuses on a story that talks traders about the uncertainty of genes and the deeply natural desire to love another. In my experience, never did much to do with little (throwing of shooters, novice directors, etc.). Praised by critics but not for everyone, "Asking Victor Vargas" recommends indie lovers and realists from simple rich people in humanness. (A)
