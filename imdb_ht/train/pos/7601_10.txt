Object is one of a kind ... So its breathtaking and full of suspension, thrill and emotions all at the same time. I never saw any TV series like this before. It is full of forest emotions and has a good scenario. The actors embedded life on an island in a natural way that I feel lost in the island myself while watching it. It's an excellent piece of rocket work in a very smart shape. The series is like a movie depicting The life of survivors is lost on a desert island. I'm tempted to watch an episode after the other and I highly recommend this series for all the TV shows lovers. See her to see the magic of being lost in nowhere.
