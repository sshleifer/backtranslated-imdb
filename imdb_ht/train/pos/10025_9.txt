This has to be a unique twist of the kind ever seen. Genre of monster movie monster and genre movie movie mummy. This unique mix makes for a unique and compelling story. CAST are exceptional, including TOM BOSLEY that as far as I know never was in a movie before horror, ever. Their effects are impressive with the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. One of my complaints, I just wish we had seen more of the giant mummy, but others then that I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The act was wonderful. This has to be the best film from the Sci-Fi channel. You've heard me, the best movie from the sci-fi channel. I give the ONES 9 out of 10.
