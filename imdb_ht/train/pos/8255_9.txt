Fido is a wonderful comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that would have to entertain us these days. As already been pointed out, this is hardly a real zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead at finger point. While there are necessarily some hundred scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is featured (feel-good 50s style), I can not imagine anyone who was actually scared or was turned off by Fido & his fellow sufferer them. > <br /> While the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. The humor is not in-face, but rather submits; There is a lot of attention to detail and I keep myself smiling at benignly several of the movie. This is certainly no masterpiece in movies, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering a heart-heated black comedy.
