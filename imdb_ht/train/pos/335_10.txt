I tried to find out about this series for ages! Thanks, IMDb! I saw that as a kid and I could never get it out of my mind. As a 6 year old, of course, I was particularly hit by the Cyclopic episode, which was absolutely chilling (I talked about it so much older brother had made me a cyclops out of a cave plastic face man, which I still have) What do I remember too, though, was the atmosphere that was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious, hard and authentic. When I read the original many years after I experienced the same sensation. It's a very hard thing to take - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Each 'Odyssey' I've seen since been an enormous down-down. The characters of this series seemed genuine, real people - ancient Greek people - and not a few Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a real masterpiece! But - Why is not it better known? And why not read about VHS or DVD? I would just like to have a chance to see it again!
