Two war labor stores in a leather-goods store turned out to be secret sweetts as they correspond to aliases box-number. In this simple idea with a daily environment, Lubitsch produces a rich rug of wit, drama, impression and irony that never allowed up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-cemeteries and jokes-. Although poorly operated by Stewart's big movie at 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia story, Mr Smith), this is easy on a par with us to enjoy a whole set of unseen subtlety acts in the other films.
