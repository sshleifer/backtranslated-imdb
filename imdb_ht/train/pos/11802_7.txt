This is not the Bigfoot ever better, but by the recent standards in Nature go fake cinemas, especially showing on the Sci-Fi channel, this is quality stuff. It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so there are some F / X practices, which I like. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie is worth a look if you're a fan of Horror / Sci-Fi B and needs a range. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not an end to it, so do not be fooled. The act is better than you can expect to get into a movie like this and the LED is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are "developed" but know that things will be collected. If you watch a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two.
