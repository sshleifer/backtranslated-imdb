Get Clair of Inauguration Music. If you want to see where the first song was driving a story this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who finds he has won the lottery as his lender calls. Unfortunately her ticket is in her dress, which is in her girlfriend's apartment, she gave a run on the run that then ... oh, but that would say. This is a light and stinging story where many of the dialogue sang (most people think this did not happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It sort of film that they do not do any more, and rarely did when they did. Sound her a movie from the early days that play as a movie in five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in the way that not even Busby Berkeley did (though honestly compared to the movie makers is unjust since Berkeley has done essentially step tone numbers and Clair has moved the camera to the "real world"). It's an amazing little movie. and a good movie that will just make you smile. It's just a fluffy piece of fun. <br /> I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's really all you need to know.
