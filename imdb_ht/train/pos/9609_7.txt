This was a very good movie, I like it. I thought it was a very accurate look at Bulimia and how it's not about regimes, it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and to choose this. Animals were a very well-trained character and at the scene where he met his mother on the food disorder you can see the inner pain and hear him in his voice and you know how deep the pain Is that it is feeling. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth hears the words, "It's not about you." her mother. These words were so true and were added to this scene in the movie. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
