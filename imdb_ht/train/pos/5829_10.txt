This is one of three or three favorite Stooges shorts, and without doubt Christian Christine McIntyre's best performance with the trio. It is good in a number of other shorts, but here it is absolutely brilliant. His song is not funny at all, in fact it is downright beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the song improves the humor rather than lousy from it. We listened to McIntyre the whole song of the Spring Voice not less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we do not skate in his voice, and partly because it mixes well with the Stooges antics. The use of soprano surgery in a comedy is reminiscent of Kitty Carlisle's role in the Marx Brothers "One Night of the Opera," but the song is more part of the comedy here than in "Opera," and McIntyre ( perhaps more of other performances than here) exhibited a comedy talent in his own that Carlisle never did. Buffoonery Stooges, McIntyre's songs, and a well-constructed draw combined for 5 out of 5 stars.
