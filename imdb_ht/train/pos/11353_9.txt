This movie was excellent. It details the struggle between a committed detective against the ignorance dedicated to the corruption of the communist regime in Russia during the 80's. I give these film films for it does not look at birth and development of medico-legal investigations into a globally isolated (thanks to the "regime") community. This is a graphic movie. It presents an image of unskilled violence and remains tragic. There is nothing that "candy-coated" with extra blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on Russian reliable assassins Andrei Chikatilo. I'm familiar enough and the true story has a very deep appreciation for how real they have kept the movie. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate humor and black humor, this movie is a must-see.
