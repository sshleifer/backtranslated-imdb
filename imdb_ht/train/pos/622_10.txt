While I'm not considering myself a big fan of Fairy Tale movie, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailer as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the baldy Velma Von Tussle's Hairspray) . Boy, is it so compelling evil here as a witch, especially with his age-ugly makeup at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" protects his "reputation"! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others doing fine works here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are beautiful classics, there are also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Bernard Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is good at Tristan's lead and he looks much like his dad Dunstan as a young man I thought he was in early stage with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have been compared to this Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblance, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginative story as told by an old grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you see and hearing could actually happen even with all the happiness that is happening at all. So, on this note, I highly recommend Stardust.
