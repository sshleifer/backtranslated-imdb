I love the Doodlebops. My son looked at them for more than a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. The Doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but are concerned? were you serious? The TV should not teach your children about the number or alphabet. parents should. Get on it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a nice voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them to have nice singing voice and NOT lip singing. Imagine, dance, jump around and always sing. They have talent, kids love them I enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show on television for kids. AND a stone band for children. How amazing is that? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear that? If it is not, It is awesome! Leave it alone. It's not like it or anyone else promoting the inversion of our kids!
