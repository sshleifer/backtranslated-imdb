This movie was beautiful. She was full of memorable imagery, good acting, and touching subjects. It would be very easy to write it as being too sentimental, but that's the feelings that a movie tries to achieve. I was totally involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There was a few cheesy shots, but what to expect in a religious propaganda movie. The only complaint I can confuse was not a ton of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumph, contrast, failure, etc.; It was designed for a quick look at a few highlights of one of the most amazing and historic figures in the most amazing time ever.
