I enjoyed the movie and would suggest giving anyone just out for a good time. Do not take the movie all too seriously because it's worth it to Disney and it's rated G. It's good fun though some parties can be recognized by adults but kids would never notice, particularly the "triangles" between Cruella, Le Pelt, and faithful Cruella's Value Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really made her own Cruella, it's so terrifying even when she is "cured" in her fur love way, she can bet the audience scared and shrills it that literally shakes the theater. (I even found myself jumping in my chair when he catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as Ella's favorite dog.) All in all I'll go see it again in the theater, I get to enjoy it very much.
