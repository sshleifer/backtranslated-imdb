As I watched this movie I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child grows in a rural area I felt as if I was a kid again! The black pond (it is called a "tank" in central Texas), running into the country as a free wild spirit! The story was very credible and I totally lost it and cried in the direction of the end. Through the pain we go in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
