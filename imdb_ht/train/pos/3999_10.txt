I'm embarrassed to say that I missed the "Mom" when she was in the theater. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few I gave here. This is English independent filmed with such care and high quality. He drew me to relentlessly. The story, low-charging and purely human, is brutally honest and absorbed, thanks to the act of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The note is hard-wired on the field. The scenario is seasonally, glossy clothes by Hanif Kureishi writer in mundane life. This story addresses great and subtlety issues in an Impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards, despite many nominations. It's simply one of my favorite movie ever.
