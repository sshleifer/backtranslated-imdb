The "Purple" is truly amazing. There is no such thing, and I do not think there is ever going to be. It's a roller coaster of emotions and pain that the viewer takes on. The actors are impeccable and the lead is superb. I absolutely love it. A movie never made me so happy. It's nice, that's the best way to explain it.
