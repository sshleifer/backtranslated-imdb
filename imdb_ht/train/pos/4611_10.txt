Version: Universal / Hong Kong legend R4 DVD released. Cantonar / English Translation <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsolete with the 'Matrix', and I was perhaps one of fifteen-year-olds who still believe that 'Terminator' was better than 'Matrix'. I was but a simple young boy, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a shining light on a TV station I never really looked, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - 'Police History' would be about later. They were fifteen, and saw only 'Rumble in Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "WOW AWESOME", she sat for her look, and always cried out "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progresses. Two weeks later, after SBS showed trilogy 'Police History', I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong cop who busts a big drug-Lord, Chu (Yuen Choir). Secretary Chu, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), was kept by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things go bad - bad reyaaal - when Chu's case is postponed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan to die. <br /> <br /> 'Police History' is one of the greatest movies ever, and certainly one of my favorite movie films Jackie. It starts strong, and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. The whole thing is great. However, some of the funny parts may seem a little flavor to more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. For a movie action, the story is very good, and Jackie is a better actor of this past than it is in the current and intensive story of 'New Police History'. This is not 'panacea', but maybe that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police History' is one of Jackie's finest works. She got me hooked on Jackie Chan's movie, and should give a good start to any Jackie potential fan. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan's movie does not come better - 10/10
