This film was nominated for the best photo but lost from Casablanca but Paul Lukas defeated Humphrey Bogart for the best actor. I do not see why Lucile Watson was nominated for the best actor to support, I just do not think he did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and three children are leaving Mexico and coming to United States at the first stage of the movie. They go to the Davis Family Rail. Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis from being tired of the need for rest. But when they come home, they are a Nazi who lives there and they are not much either able to do about it. It looks like the Nazi only cares about money and wants to make a deal with Lukas. They are much more in the scheme, but you can get that out for yourself.
