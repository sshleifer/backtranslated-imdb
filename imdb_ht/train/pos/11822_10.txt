Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movie ever. I must admit to those who did not see it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone is expecting to be so high that many have left down simply because the plot is so simple. But it is based on a comic strip ... what did you expect? Creativity, this amazing movie! Their composition, make-up, music, costume, and acting impressive make this film. The film has bloody blood and no bad language - it's one of those rare days. Directed, produced, and star Warren Beatty as the Fighter ace fighter goes up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his crowd of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the Breathless seduction Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. It has the best of a cover that I've heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the movie is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is really a piece of artwork that sadly neglected by the public. For the sum of these, this film brings the child to all of us. It's a movie that will let you smile at the end.
