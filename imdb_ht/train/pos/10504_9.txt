Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser is up to its usual shenanigans (yes it is a mute word but the only one I can think of) and Mario must stop it again. This game is very fun to play, and it has plenty of my nostalgia. The only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are terrible in today's standards, but everything else is very good (especially the small mini-games you can unlock) It's the second best N64 game (the best day Conker's Dead Dead) that I recommend to any fan of Mario, or any fan of platform games. It beat out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> 9/10 or: A
