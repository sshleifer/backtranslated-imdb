Pierce Brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns to an outrageous top-parody, as the aging malignant Julian Noble killer, who has a particular fondness for girls, calves and minish clothes. During a job in Mexico City, she met Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-faced Denver suburban business-man, who's in town making his deal in-a-lifetime-time, at a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and gross and Julian comments, they become friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, . She proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold-war spies. The scene in which the two meet in a brilliant hotel bar (stunning and beautifully photographed layers) is really a brave piece of acting skills. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully screened, two actors are hugely impromptu, but they succeed beautifully! It almost feels like a new standard of screen acting. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEETS STEETS IMPROVED and add one of the most subtle basements in the genre of genre and their own typecasting actors (James Bond Brosnan in particular), and you got one of the most delightful couples in the delight the latest Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story puts thin after a while. After an hour, the movie just ran out of steam. But and I can not put my finger on it exactly, I enjoyed this much. It just feels very cool and original, with some imaginative use of lying with lighting, with some suggestions from Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other characters do not give much to do, but this movie offers something new, in which respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in mixing all conventional ways into a fun parody. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
