I saw this movie literally more than 100 times ... it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment !!! Power Boothe provides a stellar performance. As an actor as William Shatner (Impulsion, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up Academy, 1981) I never thought an actor could take "intensities" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie captures its best performance !!!
