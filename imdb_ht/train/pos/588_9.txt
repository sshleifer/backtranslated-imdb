I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciate his love for the American people and the country. In a river running through it, Redford displays lyric's romanticism and beautiful visuals in the Rocky High Mountains of Montana as if it was a painter landscape of the 19th century ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes the visual love of the word and text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Kiss The Serpent, Reigne Margot). Redford's throw is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man with educational methods including flying fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt created a family of interactions to reflect the same issues all meet and grow son, and later, young men complex. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally credible as the brothers who love to fly fishing with each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationship between men, father and son, brother, and women in the world outside that one River runs through it through a vein in telling stories that are missing in many of Hollywood films that produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these special relationships however, Redford's attention is given in the language as they speak in dialogue. This is a literary, beautiful listening and unforgettable script when coupled with the stunning Montana Montana and rivers. Words and settings are equal to performance by a cast of materials. While the idea of ​​flying fishing can seem an odd device to a story, it's not so implosable by Redford's direct hand. Given the material, Redford's in a simpler and life-time is worth reviewing again and again.
