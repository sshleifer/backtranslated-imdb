I've seen that movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you've always dreamed of - you can win it. This shows a great desire to fulfill happiness happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can do different things and you must be happy.
