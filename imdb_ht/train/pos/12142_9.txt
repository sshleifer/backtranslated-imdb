After 21 movies and three years of work in Hollywood Bette Davis finally got a role he claimed as his own and set him as a force to be identified. As Mildred Rogers, Davis broke out with a completely unsympathetic role in a slutty waitress who became Leslie Howard's target, and was already eager to lean his teeth into a role like this, he had no calming of these things terrible character was meant to do throughout the movie and the terrible transformation he would suffer. He also widely noted that his performance here, one of the few things that made this movie a bit uneven look, was one to remember even after two remakes and scenes where he was torn in Howard did story movies .. <br /> <br /> At about 85 minutes, the story moves at a nice speed, telling the story of Philip Carey (Howard) as his life crosses those of the destructive Mildred Rogers over and over again. Howard and Davis' chemistry are all but non-existent - Davis sustains in an interview much later in his life personally did not care much for Howard's icinity towards him and helped him act even worse ( of character) towards him like Mildred. All the same, they look awkward with each other; The scenes together remain stiff, only saved by acidity of Davis acid bearing in line with his own nervous presence. Then again, the Cromwell's direction has a certain stiltedness on itself that fails to come at times - it tries to fill in some space (each time Davis is not) and dissolves and the montage indicated last in time (a superimposed calendar about a change to Frances Dee). All in the style are back then. This was before the techniques and angles of intricate camera entry were, and in essence, the visual story is a simplified essential translation of the novel Somerset Maugham - which says a lot, from page 600, to "Human Bondage" was indeed tough movie even then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in the go-go. Howard's performance never seems to go to many external emotions - his eyes are still sad, his expression never veers too far from losing (he could almost be a cousin far away from William Hurt's "injury accident" - injured , pain, and absolutely passive), but this is perhaps part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women (played by Kay Johnson and Frances Dee) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affection. Interestingly, Norah Johnson, once he realized Carey would never fall for it, is one of those who picked up the story and observation that people are tied to others - it is tied to Carey as Carey is tied to Mildred, and Mildred Itself is tied to Miller (or those who fit the role of supplier). In his short but memorable scene, he is one of those who holds the moral sense of the story.
