I watch movies for a living, picking that people are good enough to distribute ... Launch on those who do not make the cut. I do not say that I know more than anyone else based on this, I just brought you to how I came to watch the "Gospel of Lou" ... Anyways ... So many bad movies about My office and I actually sit at all of them. I do not actually "watch" everything, usually I just watch over the TV periodically while I'm working on the scan for output, performance, and how the story is being presented. If something catches my eye I'll take the time to watch it. "Heavy" took me in during the first few minutes I locked my laptop and wheelchair on the TV so I could completely tune in. Without saying anything, I was enthralled in the whole movie. The story is said well, the characters are either endearing or repulsive (depending on course on the actor and director of the intent of the character) and all very well played. At times I take occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes these easy easy to dismiss. I've heard other people say that at the film's film brings tears, other extreme time elapses ... I laughed a minute and cried the next and was extremely touched by this movie. Unfortunately I was able to get it because I was - as it says goes - a late week with a short dollar. This is the way he goes sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one and I can not wait to see what kind of response he gets. Good luck with your fortune or Bret Carr (if you read this), you are without a doubt a talent to look for.
