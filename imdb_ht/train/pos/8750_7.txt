Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who went on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and went up to prison after being captured and drug planted in their luggage. In this way, the film has the potential to turn into a serious film and move, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls situation and more about their friendship . <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn into excellent performance, and the movie is more about the interplay between them - the suspect, the jealousy, the questionnaire and the test of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship . This film is chosen by digging too deeply into politics or even in prison life difficulties (which is somewhat glossed over), and focusing more on these friendship issues. <br /> There are some draws drawn here, and some parts just did not seem credible or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or despair of the situations as well as we might have. And we get a lot of life out of prison, and Bill Pullman plays supposedly slaughtering lawyers who actually turn out to have a golden heart. In short, this would be, not all right, being a darker film than it was. <br /> But in general, I loved it. The act was good, the band was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth to see.
