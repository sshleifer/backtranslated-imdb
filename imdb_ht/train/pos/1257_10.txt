I read a number of reviews on this movie and I said "What's wrong with you people ?!" This was an excellent movie! I thought that this movie was superb from beginning to end and the story was very well said. I am convinced that the people who did not like this movie have not paid very good attention to the movie. There are a number of scenes very important that if you do not pay attention you will be confused and these scenes can not make sense. I encourage anyone who did not like this movie to watch it again and look it alone so that you can really pay attention. The story made perfect sense for me and as I said, was very well said. Each stage of the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All actors have done a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good at her role as always. Laurence Fishburne was superb as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was a nice touch as well, and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a nice surprise, I did not really expect anything great from him, but he pulled on a great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem of the movie. She plays a really sick person and really makes you see how disturbed her character is. Watch her in her scene, just superb !!! Also, there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of his first roles ... not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the cast members or just like thrillers. This is a great movie and should be seen. Do not listen to the opinions of others, go to the movie and get your own conclusions. I hope you will see the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for reading, <br /> -Chris
