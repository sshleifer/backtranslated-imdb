Is anyone who notes that James Earl Jones is the man who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while in the restaurant next to the lake. I watched this movie on a video that I stuck on the TV. When I was watching this scene I thought I recognized Jones voice when the "male" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape then slowly stepped in this part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen as well as laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they will have a baby, then look good or slow the scene when the camera shows the waiter, albeit, quickly.
