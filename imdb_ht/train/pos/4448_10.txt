See this movie yesterday for the first time and well liked it. I'm a student in writing screen and I liked the way the minor characters are banned just when something pivotal / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> I think the dialogue was very sharp and the quote of history is rather shocking - at a particular point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's companion; AND repelled some passions of her husband whom she had not seen in ten years; AK with the signal shot 'and then one' he hooked up with his old dog Dutch pig (why he left town in the first place!) ALL at the same time! The moral majority were totally upset when they saw this cops back in the 50's. Love the costumes and cinematography and straight out of the hip dialogue - just to look at Barbara Stanwyck and Ko making the 'Hug Bunny' good enough reason rent this movie on DVD. One of the best films in this period I've seen in a long time.
