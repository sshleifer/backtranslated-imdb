Though Cher and Cage are the focal points in this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are the best counterparts for them - this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50-year-old in love. The entire cast does a nice job from Aiello to Jan Mahoney - it shows a real slice of life. Even though I've seen this long-lasting happiness he finally catapulted cages to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From the music to the opera at the kitchen table-argument this is a very entertaining movie.
