I saw this first movie about ten years ago and I thought it was very funny indeed. It was not as bad as some critics made it out to be. The fact that he was typically described by John Hughes' s earnest show that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (By the way, I think Weird Science is good that has also been penned at lightning speed by Hughes). The movie has a very garish look at it using the main colors - red, yellow etc. - which makes it look quite unique. Throw in them also well. The prudish bunny packard and the Satan-owned Delores Salk is a stand out. The movie has certainly dated a little, but I personally prefer it to the other 'lamps' series.
