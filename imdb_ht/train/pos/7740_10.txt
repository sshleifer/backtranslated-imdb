It is rare that someone comes across a movie as impeccable as this. It's really one of the best-acting, well-structured films I have ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in many ways, with respect to each of the three main characters differently. The film tracks an intrinsic web of motivation and double crosses that traps you and refuses to let go. Adding to this the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything that has ever been engaged in celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. He exhibited romance in movies such as "Titanic" as the ancient clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while folding laundry, this is not it. You must commit yourself to this movie. You can not have a conversation while running in and out of the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat her with respect that you deserve and you will get a lot out of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the greatest movie ever.
