I enjoy the first part of this two parter, the Planet is impossible, and they were a little worried that the second part would not hold well well that it was true of the past of the two parters in the past 2 that series. But fortunately my fear was unfounded as I found myself enjoying this episode as soon as the previous one. Anyway we start with crew survivors on the run from the Ood, who came to plan the Devil. There is also a bit of philosophy on the part of the Doctor of the episode that I enjoy well. Needless to say it was a good Doctor Doctor Which story. Could it be too intense for the viewers to be smaller though. <br /> <br /> My Class: B +
