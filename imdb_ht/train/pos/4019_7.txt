When I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, which made me even more worried to check out this flick. I recall being interviewed on "Jay Leno," and said he turned down a role in the great-budget Adam Sandler comedy "One Longer Backyard" to be in this movie. So, obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove he was acting chop. I will not overprise Snoop for his performance in the "tenants." There are certainly better rapaces / actors, like Mos Def, who could have done more with his role. But the point is Snoop has done a "good" job. It may not seem to shake some of his body's trademark motion and vocal inflation, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem to do. The point is I find him convinced of the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's fascinating character. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance of the movie, though his subtle act will be more likely to be covered by Snoop's not-so-so-subtle act. Being a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I could not help but find the characters and a bit fascinating scheme. She has aggravated me that Snoop's character would always be asking McDermott to read her work, and berate her to criticize her. But do you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers like that. His character was supposed to be flawed, as was McDermott, in his own way. I only mild criticism of the film should be its completion. For some reason, it just felt too much for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than conspiracy.
