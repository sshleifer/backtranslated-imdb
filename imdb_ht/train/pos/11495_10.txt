We saw this at one of the local film artist in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, TX. It was a total surprise compared to the writing-up of the theater ballot but we were both hauled by the artistry. It was very well done and (apparently) photos of a shock (German name for castles) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit explanation of sexual relations in a group of men and women isolated from the day-to-day constraints. It's fantastic on more levels than I can remember. We came home after the movie and talked to speak up to about 4 am in the morning. The version we saw was in English (mostly) so there must be at least two versions since the first evaluator saw the movie (probably the original version) German version. I searched and searched for a video video version but never came up with anything. Would like to have a VHS or DVD version. It explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great lesson about how to deal with your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince him to release again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine getting tired of watching the frenetic performance of the actors who are now probably all of their forties. Please bring it back.
