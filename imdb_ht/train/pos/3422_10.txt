I desperately need this on a tape, not a DVD, and soon! <br /> I have one nephew of the infantry, but not yet deployed, although it is set to go to Iraq soon after December 2008. I lost my dearest son to Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 out in a sense of rocket in a green area. I have another nephew coming into the army as soon as he graduated from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some ideals and romanticized about what the military service is. My foot has died after only 10 days in land and never goes out on any my mission to have no way to refer any of the experiences shown in this documentation from any kind of personal experience that might They were targeted by my now dead son. There is nothing I can do about who's in, or now goes, but I have one left who does not raised his hand and swore in YET. I desperately want him to be informed, not one of the others. <br /> <br /> Fun to help me with this .. Ground documentary film is the best visual reference I've ever seen. I need to somehow make my youngest nephew look what he is getting himself in before he is late. But (do not laugh) I need my mother to see this first. It must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of ​​them, but the truth of these will be bathed in, maybe forever. Then he will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this movie and once he has then he can then have her son, my youngest nephew, look at it too. Then my nephew can begin to take this seriously. <br /> ((who has another time then will show on TV? if is time, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is, mom I do not own a DVD player, it still uses video (that's incorrect? and tape?) so I need to find a way to read this movie. Can I buy this to anyone in this form? If not, is there another way I get this in the form of a tape from anyone? Is there a legitimate link from which I can pay to download it on my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so, who would contact me. I will be happy to pay the privilege of giving it a legitimate link. If you have any alternative ideas, I will consider anything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I can not release the three and the emotional number for everyone who makes it too high a cost to every son of my family in this generation. Please help me. I will happily call you, email me a number if it is the best way to get the information needed. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
