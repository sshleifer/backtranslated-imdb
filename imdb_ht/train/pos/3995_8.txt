Kureishi has not been exactly blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. The latest adaptation of the travesty as 'intimacy' has lost much of the writing. But Mother's surpassing all his previous incarnations, eclipse even my lovely Laundrette. A middle-aged woman has victory over the hood for having a very carnal relationship with her emotional-weakest daughter. The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of acting as it is the finished gift of the writing. And in Daniel Craig we have a strutting, brash, anti-hero gruff who denies the audience of ever question why a young stud would contemplate a grandmother's sagging bed. So much injection, the film fails only in the weak sheet of the peripheral characters, but as a study of subconscious lust, it's a winner.
