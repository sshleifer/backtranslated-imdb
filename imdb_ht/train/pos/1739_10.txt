From the look of a NASCAR maniac like myself, the movie is interesting. You can see many race machines from 1983. Even hard, the racing scenes are not so realistic. But I have to admit, that I have not seen any race before 1995, because before that time, they did not show any NASCAR race in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the look of a fan of Burt Reynolds like I, the movie basically is what we used to see in Reynolds in the 80's: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, as in his bandits cinemas. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you only love one of these 2 things, I also recommend watching it. If you love both NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, you should always give it a chance, but remember, this film was far from an Oscar Academy award. <br /> It is the typical humor of the 80's. If you like movies like the Cannonball Movies, and Police Academy, you'll also love one.
