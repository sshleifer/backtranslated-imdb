WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 Jan Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) -miss-21st Century "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> Jan Cusack ?? who co-writes the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser ?? star as a hit knocker-who called Brand Hauser who burned out, but decided to follow thru one final placement by icing a Eastern Middle Eastern minister called Omar Sharif (yes, by Omar Sharif but you get tone here from this misfire for a laugh) by the former vice president of the USA (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Big Pointe Blank" co-hort, makes a mean Dick Cheney manipulated to turn here), overhead Brand made the deed under the guise of a trade show Ticqistan mythical producer (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the American private corporation Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> While browsing Brand was faced with a moment of clarity when he came across intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually fell in love with her. Tamerlane is sponsoring the unions' union in eastern European sensation of Japan Young Yonica Babyye (an amazing decent Duff Aping celebrity and language-to-beched) and son of the idiot of the country's leader. > <br /> What follows is a bold attempt for a 21st Century black comedy in the "DR" .Gran for all intentions and goals has Unfortunately more lacks than hit in this great attempt to laugh at political message ( an unjust war that was outsourced by American capitalist, check!) While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned "Pointe" he adds some nice touches to his man in black (he vaccinated in Tabasco sauce corner of the cut), the rest of the cast play catch (except Joan Sister who is a riot as the high-nursing-de-camp support for Hauser and has one of the movie cinema's films: "My Mass Communication Skills they finally pay ") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq War earlier this year at 180 different degrees "Grace Will Gone" and here it permits political views put on its sleeve; while the overall admirable movie rhythm and rhythms are largely no-thanks to the first-time filmmaker Joshua Seftel makes his first directors here (and is apparent) except for perhaps the choreographed choreographer who involves intimate habits the fiancÃ© babysitter. /> <br /> A beautiful attempt yet a misguided failure; Maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the idiocy in war to speak for itself instead of making the heavy lift in his head.
