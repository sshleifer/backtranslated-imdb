Sammi, Curr a rock stone metal, tried to stop him, tried to ban him, tried to sing his music !! (such as real life Dee Snider, from Twisted Sisters, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Kill A Fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play on Halloween in her old high school for a dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how Sammy was, and what he felt (or he was?) Nuke, the DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gave copies The only Eddie's record is Eddie's record. But when Eddie tries to play the record back, she finds Sammi talking to her from the dead and tell her what to do to get back to the bullies in her school which hated it with his music .. All work out until Sammi starts killing !! A big movie and must be seen for metal flying heavy fans, with a great sound track by Fastway, and just in case you do not know which song songs like or know Fastway and do not like them, they have to change their voice a bit has style as well in sounds like the more known Cinderella, or Ratt .. Is the movie a true horror movie? Well that depends on what you call a horror movie, For me a true horror movie is a slasher, and lots of kill, or just plain scary .. This movie is neither, not enough death, but it can not be called an action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so that's why I'd guess it has to be a horror .. so if you want to "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' on midnight among your soul! " Pass Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is yours .. I mean "what are you afraid of? Only Rock 'n' Roll!?"
