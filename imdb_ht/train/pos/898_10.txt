One should be very jaded indeed not to be swept up in this gem in a movie (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies, too). The actors, the beautiful surroundings, places, and surroundings, the deep emotions described, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just beautiful. The human element (imperfect) also woven into, creates some drama and drives the draw, as well as allowing a sincere resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open and the emotions of the characters he shows, he nearly steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this movie to all those who love true romance - those who go beyond superficial love of beauty - as one of the best films out there, Hindi or otherwise!
