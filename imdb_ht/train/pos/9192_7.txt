Let's start this review out of a positive note - I'm very happy they did not decide wimp out with Tony being shot and doing a retrospective season like some people were rumors. Actually, creators and writers of this episode David Chase have done quite the opposite. We do not actually know if Tony is alive or dead. It's a coma and his chance to retrieve them very thinly anything. This episode seemed to move slowly, and coma joining Tony dream was in involving identity identities and robbery Asian monastic slapping in * t from him was absolutely, flat-out strange. After 45 minutes I got a little sick of everyone in sorrow, but that would not be a reason to slam this episode. It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was always well written and intense. Edie Falco has given a career-defining performance in this episode as the wife of conflict that has to deal with her husband was able to be broken. I also found it interesting to AJ to fall out of school and swearing a vendetta against Junior, which most likely AJ will not have the zoom balls. Silvio is now acting-boss who opens many doors in the episodes later. There was a lot of great looking at this episode, too, and I thought Spidafore Peito 'Paul-Smoker' might meet her crush if she was being a vicious sob <br /> This was not a great episode and just because even if Tony killed, we as a audience worshiped him and felt he is our hero in the show. This was an episode that was needed for the series, though it was a little bit induced towards the conclusion. Kudos in performance Edie Falco, and David Chase and the writers to create this complete and unpredictable complete twist. This is the only season in the 'Sopranos' where I do not have a F * Cking sign where it will go. I can not wait for next week's episode. My Rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> Best Line of the Episode: (Paulie AJ): "Let's Go, Van Helsing!"
