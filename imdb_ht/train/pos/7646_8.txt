This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. He plays right in theory in "Multiple universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not really matter is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has such a tough time understanding what happens, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
