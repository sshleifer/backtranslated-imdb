The story: On the island Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets Kathleen's mysterious. His free spirit and lust for Bob's life, who suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. His life is not so simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Can Kathleen be trusted? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds although although it remains a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if 'psychology' would have worked out a bit more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates the choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my look. The story never came to an emotional point, even though the characters go to enough to justify that. So you do not get to know the characters on the deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'creditable way' way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen was played by a younger actress, as this character's future does not work well for an adult up women. Camera work is beautiful, and there are some great shots in the nature of the island. I give the movie a 7/10.
