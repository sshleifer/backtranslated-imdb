Chan Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" might very well be labeled in big water in the film cycle of martial film film film. This dancing kung fu season has a lot of amazing cast - a veritable person who is in the Shaw stable. Even if the scheme is fairly standard and choreography in battle is superb as usual, it is the cheh touch in the matter that makes this movie remarkable and enjoyable. The essence of reverence appears for the story and tradition of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every frame. Not Unlike William Keighley's Paid 69th Fight The film of the same film with John Ford's same title or salute at West Point in the "Long Gray Line," The Cheh "Shaolin Temple" is a fondly decorated oe in this same style . <br /> The cultural correlation I tried to do is compare the Shaolin Alamo Temple. Watching this movie will give the same feelings and feelings of nostalgia that you have experienced many years ago in the school history when you learned the courage and sacrifice of those heroes who ended up in the Alamo.
