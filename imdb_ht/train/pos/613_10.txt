please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> Never before have I seen such a bold and original story created for the big movie screen. Bold, because the script is still doing a very fantasy fantasy stage to safely avoid - a step into something new, creative and daring. Just when you think 'oh, I've seen this before' or 'I'm sure this is what will happen right now' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more in the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and does with the energy that he simply steals the show in each scene. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names perform exceptional roles. I had everyone in complete trying to give her best for this movie. But once again, the story by Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply exceptional. <br /> I watch this movie in a pre-exam today, one day before the official release, and hoping it will be great success. There are many humor but also moments of tension as well as beautiful sensitive scenes. Look at the eyes of Yvaine, the 'frivolities' of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of the Witch Lamia - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me this is the number one fun movie in 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - bumper <br /> <br /> peace and love
