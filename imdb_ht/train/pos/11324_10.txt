I agreed with everyone else posted. <br /> I watch it quite a while ago but I'll tell you, every time I hear certain music from this animated I remember in the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I got when it's watching it, and it makes me cry (like a happy feeling sad again). But I found that the love story of it felt alittle run and did not explain good thing but it did not ruin any part of the look experience. <br /> I was in this anime so much that after the end I just did some research (and watch the finish some times more) and I found all my answers with a whole lot more. I love how to configure historical legends to fit into this animated, it was amazing and just made me want to search a lot more. (I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this animated) <br /> <I think it should have a longer range but if this is all worked and then pull it cut nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who loves emotional animation with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a bit of fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Also, though this is based on a H-game it does not have any of the things in it and I actually prefer it this way. (I have no problems with animated maturity, in most cases I prefer it)
