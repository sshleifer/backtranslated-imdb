For fans of 1970 film film horror movie, this movie would be a treat. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie. If not Amikus's best film, it's certainly one of them. The best episode, just saved for the last, is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - it is really excellent. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he did not do more of these kinds of movies. All in all, this is a fun movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which always gives me the ramps to this day.
