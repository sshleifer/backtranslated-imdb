I saw the first trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back to the day, after hearing Stephen King praising him in the high sky. Not really a fan of stars, I always wanted to see it because I'm a big thriller fan. <br /> I was not disappointed. The act was superb, especially in the two boys. I usually destroy the children's actors, but Young Adon and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job to direct her too. It was very good shot. <br /> One must also note the twisting draw. Three twists at the end struck hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final sound of the movie, coupled with the gravity of what has just been revealed, gave me thrill to this day, even though I was re-watching the movie for many times. <br /> A true joint.
