Let's find some right things first: zombies do not exist so the film maker may have to walk, run, hell fly even if he wants. That's what makes this original zombie movie so good. All of these were so damn original. I hate her when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when boy fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should only roar like a typical Romero movie, once again zombies do not exist so a kinast can make whistle zombies if he wants to. The zombies in this movie all look pretty good, but OBVIOUSLY they do not rotten corpses since they just jammed dead! They are very messed up though with full face cuts and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-feeding cat. She looked so damn real to my daughter crying when he saw her. This film had really good reviews at Fangoria and Rue Morgue so I wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to tasting the real horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go to her rent!
