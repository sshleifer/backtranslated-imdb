So we compromise. This was a fairly good movie, I loved the art direction (it felt far more "real" than most kids movies), and the costumes were not too cutesy. The children actors were not bad to watch (the adult performances are trendy in cheesy direction). It was great that they showed how a kid bullied bullies to other people as well as children standing up to intimidation. <br /> I do not know how many UPS would want to see that for themselves, but it's a great movie taking a kid. And since "Barnyard" has apparently been attended by 100+ children at the same time, I'm really pleased we have chosen the little show face of "glass" instead.
