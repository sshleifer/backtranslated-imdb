I love this movie because I grew up around racing. Bo Boone behind the sulky reminds me of my dad who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike good jockeys, men at normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 House of Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, a good movie feel. (Incomprehensible though Bo Boone's religious / moral opinion banned her from ever kissing the girl! Well a change in standard fare today.) Houses in Indiana and Walter Brennan (films in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever sing in singing) captures the stress and struggles so much to make the ultimate achievement more satisfying, but it requires a greater emotional investment.
