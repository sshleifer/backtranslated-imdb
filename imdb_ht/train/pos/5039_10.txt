Stunning. Absolutely stunning. This is a movie about two children at Dad suddenly there is a vision. He claimed an angel to visit him and told him that they needed to kill "evil spirits". It gets instruction later, and begins to round up the demons, which is, in the naked eye, ordinary people. They killed the so-called demons with an ax at the top and cut them up and buried them in the field. Fathers claim that he can see their sins when touching them. The movie continues, with a twist at the end. Things I love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception. Are Dad Really Angry? Or does he say the truth? The hearing is decided. Go to the trial for yourself, and see the movie. Right now.
