While this movie style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a very good movie. In fact, he was seen as an excellent film in his day, as he was nominated for the first time Oscar Picture (lost in wings). I still consider wings to be a superior movie, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general of Czarist Russia who lives out his final day making a few bucks in the 1920s was not an extra Hollywood. Luckily it seems to change as it gets a drop of appeal - to play an Imperial Russian general fight the Communists during the revolution. Of course this is not a lot of a wise-acting stretch, but it also gets old in thinking about the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what's next I'll leave you, but it's a very good movie - particularly in the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, with the makeup she does not look younger than she did in many of her later films.
