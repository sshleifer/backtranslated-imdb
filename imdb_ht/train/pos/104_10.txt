This film had an interesting cast, it dulled not a cast list but the actors in this movie did a great job. I'm glad we have a movie theater as one, the story is the basic actors are basic and so are the ways to execute it, you do not need a million dollar budget to make a movie just a mix of ordinary actors and a basic draw. I love the road being on the street to the top and that there was no other person around and whatever I was interesting was that they did not close a coffee they had gears and that they did it all from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a great job of showing the role of the hostage situation. This was a great movie and I hope to see more like it in the near future.
