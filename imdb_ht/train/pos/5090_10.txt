I liked this movie. Great scenario with actors and good movie together. She tells the story in a way I can fully understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I would like to know where I was able to get the band. I can not find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I was able to get the band. Other than not being able to get the band I thought the film was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is some of her best works. His past film was OK, but this one really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as being one of the best TV movies ever revealed. Congrats producers and writers in such a great piece of work.
