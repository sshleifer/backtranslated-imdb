Ok - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond her good looks, the film is carried in a predictable plot but draws reasonable. <br /> Starting out, we're presenting in the lead women three films. One of the top - very concerned about his image and never married. A police officer - with kids and an old bad guy to go on. The third - a power and status of hungry doctors who have a desire for recognition with the three senior. They are almost the "first wife of the club", and indeed there are many verbal bashes in the former involved as well as some "left the credit card" behavior. Character set - the movie continues. McDowell's character, the head, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organism, fills in for the regular player (Doughty) captures his eyes. What will be his friends say about this incident that ensuing? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A tissue or two recommended if you are the teary type - the end of the uptake, but maybe not what you would expect. All in all a big movie that stands out from the current choices of action, special effects and horror horror.
