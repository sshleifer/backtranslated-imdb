Well, I'm honest: It's not exactly a Sholay. But you can not find a Sholay weekly. In fact, you might see different signatures of "Without My Daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this film. However, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a well-inspiring, well-organized and well-done one. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysteria, but everyone else is laudable. Especially so on Dipti Naval: Take her away after a long time, but she has not lost any of her favor. In fact, he did better than I last saw him. Another of the Bollywood stars seems to grow as beautiful as they age? <br /> All in all, a nice look.
