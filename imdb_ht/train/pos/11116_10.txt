"The Godfather", "Citizens Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of the above compared to the complex complex of the "Sopranos". Each and every character has a layer of absolute layer, completely and completely three-dimensional. We care about Tony Soprano with all our heart, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil, it is wrong. Soprano is most provocative, complicated, and fascinating protagonist ever created at this point in history. If you are in the mood to be open to challenge as a viewer, and must forever change your feelings towards entertainment, see the "Sopranos". I challenge anyone to sit and watch the very first episode of Season 1, and they do not want to continue with the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential to anyone's **** collection of out 4
