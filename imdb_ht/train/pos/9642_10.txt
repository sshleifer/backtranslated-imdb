The movie is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to the genre of Cinema Hollywood where each line must be pronounced in a perfect way and where every move is accurate. The actors are playing the role of lovers doing a great job that represents the feelings of their characters and thoughts - their daily life adventures. In general, the movie climaks the viewer in a depressed state. This is where realism in the whole story is apparent. Not everything happens the way we think it should happen. I can say even if this film does not end up with a bad score. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
