I swear I could watch this movie every weekend in my life and never get sick of it! Each aspect of human emotions is captured for magic by the acting, the script, the direction, and the general feeling of this movie. It was a long time since I saw a movie that actually made me laugh at the street, reflected from sadness, and felt every sentence intended to come in to the most excellent work! We need more pictures like this !!! Mike Binder: Do you hear ???
