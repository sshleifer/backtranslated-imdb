My 3 year old likes it. I loved her, my wife loved her. So, 10 out of 10 of our relatives. As for the level of violence? Not really violent, especially in the variety of slap sticks. No one really dies, there is no gore, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is suitable for children, much more than that much Saturday morning cartoon. <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should go. First of all, nice graphics, beautiful textures make, and true depths, do not try to be realistic, but form a whole artistic. The moss on the rocks, the rust on metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone, everything adds to the whole. <br /> <br /> Character model, unlike CG CG contemporary CG, is original, not beautiful, yet in a whole artistic. Faces can look less permissible than in other movies, but the characters are more marionous-like than people-like. I think it's a good thing, it's all about the truth, how strange it can sound, it's easier to stop your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothes, on par, at least with the likes of Pixar. Just remember in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant sluggish; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and all of them have retail clothes that have caused me to pause the movie just to admire it. Far from the car love, and even mi ?? Space was made many times, but the settings surrounding Dragon Hunters are only comparable to some scenes never end up with Lord of the Rings, but yet it is a whole artistic, with many good ideas thrown on effortlessly. Beautiful visits such as the scene of Monsters Inc where they ride all the thresholds at its storage facility, or Wall E where we see the garbage towers it did, there are many of this film, everything is grand but not never stay; it is just the background of the whole road! The intermediate location of the area and the fantastic falls. The Chinese wall, the floating islands in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is truly where I believe CG should go, do something that takes you to go and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music varies and not only epic, and fortunately without any song, and purely original for the movie. <br /> <br /> Animation is quite good. His inspiration borrowed from cartoons, especially some good use of stretch and weigh. Sometimes not that realistic, but the 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is well done. Lian-chu gentle giant and uncertainty is gradually growing in basking confidence in the attention of bone. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo the vicidiary manager of Lian-Chu redeems himself in the end, while bone is not really changed at all but wanting that cute kids change anyway? I at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley of Monsters Inc <br /> <br /> The internal conflict of the group gets out of external pressure, as it should be in a story suitable fantasy. <br /> The story is mostly reminiscent of the story never ends, especially how the world brakes apart. Monsters are pretty standard fare, except the one flickering. It lacks Emotional Impact Wall E, which is really strong point in this movie, but it is a much more fun ride, and misses the annoying scene replaying into the former one, and has action from the first stage. This movie is what you want to look for a fun and exciting time. The movie all there, as I mentioned a whole vision, which seems to have been strikingly strictly at all. <br /> It seems, that the environment is ready for more adventures, and I hope one would expect it. <br /> One side note, the French actor makes Lian-Chu sounding a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad he did not, even though he's one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new, me, voice. <br /> I give it a max rating, somewhat surprised at the ratings and mediocre given by some; I tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote. This movie approaches as an adventure, and as a European film, not opposed to Hollywood, but different.
