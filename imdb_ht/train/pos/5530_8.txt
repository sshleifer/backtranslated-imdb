A must see for anyone who likes photography. Stunning and grandiose, leaving you in ore. See it twice once in a movie and now on DVD. It holds just about DVD, but on the big screen this was something else. <br /> <br /> Take my two daughters to see this and love her, my oldest was called to the end.But it was the one who wanted to see her again tonight when she saw it in the video store. Its simple say to love a child in nature and in particular a fox said well. in some ways he reminds me of the bear in telling him a story by documentary format. which works for children very well. Did not teach them very important, you make yourself clean. <br /> But the star of this film is cinematic, how to do what they did. amazing just amazing.
