Just have a look at this film, which is very upset. It has also been in South Africa twice, around the time this film is set. <br /> It is certainly hard-hit, and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. Increasing but getting into hard drives allows for a break, and there are certainly some light moments. <br /> <br /> Never see Nigel Hawthorne even longer. He came across as a very twisted person, and I found myself neglecting him more every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Totally agree with the Steve-thomp knuckle and well thought-out comment.
