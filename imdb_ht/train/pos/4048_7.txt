Rohmer loses out of his usual portrait of French midfielder saying this drama suits the difficulties of an aristocratic lady during the French revolution. What's more attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has achieved. The images were digitally decorated also to make them look like baroque pictures. At some point you can not really tell whether you are watching a movie or a series of photos of the Mus√©e de Louvre. Each shot is like a piece of art. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
