Originally I rented this movie for my daughter since she is keen on football - and I was not disappointed this way (except the scheme interferes with the football scene). As a father I think I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I must admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to kids nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the subject). In such a way that emotion was a right tune in the main mainstream of the movie - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is being introduced by a British girl born - Jasmine (Jess) - in eastern-Indian heritage that dreams of playing soccer professional. The wedding that hangs from her older sister in a traditional Hindu wedding provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a beautiful way) to expect her and her fears for her future. The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration and her parents expect it - yet no different in substance than most parent-parent relationships. <br /> In SUMMARY, the GREAT FOTOS scenes (much to learn from slowmo) and while I did not need the storyline - something needed to keep the movie going.
