Trawling in the Sci Fi section weekly section of the Local Rental Video store I had lost hope of finding any good movies I had not yet seen. Rent Cypher was like a punt on a very hostile horse. My son is so jaded with the current "B" Science Fiction that he has not bothered to see this again. <br /> It must be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> Well this was a really nice surprise! This is also by film B. It's not a "blockbuster" of the epic variety and does not try to be - plus a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for drawing it to be completely savored. The special effects are powerful when they are used - my only complaint is the super hell is a fantastic explanation CGI at first glance, but to find it right in its 2 appearance, & that's where everything else is top notch. In any case, they affect high. <br /> I will not give anything away on the field. The scheme structure has a Russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instincts (though with many different content). Just I will say that Pick Jeremy Northam for the lead was a stroke meter. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and accented her for this movie hit the ear as a very strong sort of forcing New England dialect, it's a tad off key. See the final twist of the draw and you will see why this is such a brilliant choice! She Lucy Liu is just right with her "she kisses me - she'll shoot me" corner. <br /> I rarely watch movie several times in the day - this is one of them.
