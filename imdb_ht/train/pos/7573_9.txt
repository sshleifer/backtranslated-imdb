One of the most fear-free experience ever is that you will keep the lights on next to your bed. Great storyline with a romantic, horrible, and ironic plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a surprise to a return character! Not to mention that the voice-act improved the improvement over the previous set of series. Do not miss out on the best of the series.
