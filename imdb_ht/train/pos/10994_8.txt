This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watch it all by chance a night on TV. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but afterwards I understood that an amazing product was this. <br /> I suggest to some friends to see the movie, just telling me that it was a bad movie B. How wrong. Superficial criticisms. <br /> I think the film is almost a product of genius! The well known director does an excellent job here and it is a shame to say that he came from the game all the time.
