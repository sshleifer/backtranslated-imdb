What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you will not regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth brings the film on his shoulder and although nothing more than him, I still love it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after hearing it a few times, you really start to sympathy.
