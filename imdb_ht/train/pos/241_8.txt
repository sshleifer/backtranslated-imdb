I'm tired of those who judge film about their "historical accuracy". He's a MOVIE person !! Writers and directors should put their own spin on the story! There are a number of outdoor movies that are not entirely accurate and history .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, The New York Gang, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of Mohikan .... all the fantastic films are mildly incorrectly historically. If you want to see a few big actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you view this movie and not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.
