Well not actually. This movie is very fun though. She went and saw her with the girlfriend last night and she used to "I think there could be something in my eyes" routine. The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a down on his lucky reporter who gives power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not too funny or bad, flick is good for you to see the woman. <br /> All in all 8/10 .... note * I'm not an easy sorting. That's all from BigV about and out!
