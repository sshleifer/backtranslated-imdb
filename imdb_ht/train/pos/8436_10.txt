Not only is this movie much better than the final season of H: many. But it was better than any movie that I did for TV I ever saw! <br /> Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only one small screen movie did it: How the Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise this group 2. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that the original set showed several that were better than this, but I did not mind. I just love being able to enter the world of the homeless Baltimore Squad again!
