Starfucker (which read Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best films I had ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why she is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a dark side in Hollywood. I forced someone else to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick of films.
