Hurray! A space movie that does not take itself too seriously and everyone can come together for the fun ride that is space camp. The film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together in a dodgy soup. But when the will becomes difficult - the hard to find themselves sorted out and not an unbelievable change of the characters as you can believe there are some responsibilities of young minds. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY annoying as "I'm right with you all wrong" to the instructor. I would recommend this as a wonderful night of movie with a 7 Vote.
