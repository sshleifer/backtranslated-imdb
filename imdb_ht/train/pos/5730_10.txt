Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland maybe in for anyone except Lynch and that's what makes it funny with a collective design. Violent? Yes. Uncle? Yes. Absid? Yes. A piece of garbage? Do not ever. Dumbland is a wonderful photograph of some Americans who do not have brain and swat wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- my teeth are bleeding, all the noise around and violence makes me want to cry and put me behind my bed. 2- Find the Stick! Yeah baby finds it and learns a lesson: some people should never be grateful for your actions. 3- Ant. The Lynch episode is more of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge.
