Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of the mystery films of the Sleuth tradition that could be very easily spoiled to give any real test of the plot of the movie. That's why I'm going to say that he's anxious about a play, one who is a dramatic famous mystery, another who is a promising writer, the wife of the dramatic playwright who is younger and sexier than the role should be , and a German psychic along for the ride. Director Sidney Lumet, not the film's alien, is good for the most part in creating the film's tension in need of motor. The dialogue is quick, cool, and witty. Michael Caine excelled in role as such. Christopher Reeve is servable and actually grows on you the more you see her act. Irene Worth stands out as the psychic comic. How about Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet packs it posterior to those really tight fit pants and has put it possibly the top snuffs around, but it is terribly miscast in this role - a role that should have been giving a great actress and a certainly less seductive. But why riddled with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it right now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty, and stylish. The mystery has some blatant flaws that have been destroyed somewhat, and I have not been completely satisfied with finishing, but looking Caine and Reeve under the direction of the Lumet and Levin's breeding habit was enough to undermine my interests and keep it prisoner all the time whole of the movie.
