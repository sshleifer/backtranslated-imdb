I would like to comment on this movie. Alas, my search always ends in vain. If any good citizen could help a person who is desperate to stay in this planet sick and restore his trust in humanity by offering either a UK VHS UK or his / her copy of a DVD copy of the VHS; It would be, without reservation, to be eternally grateful ..... <br /> <br /> Blake wrote "The Way Out is the Way of Wisdom", one hopes my weary way out will offer the way to fruit . ... If not, I'll have Mr Rossel's excellent gay reputation in knowing that those who saw haunted summer (for better or worse) were rich enjoying their look at the events of July 1816, too , a fellow member of this melody draw, rests his solitary solitude in solitude.
