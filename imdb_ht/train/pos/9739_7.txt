I had fun watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box office draw for comedy films. <br /> It is hired to work his dead end in London publications by NYC Media Shotgun Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his great celebrity clothes. After paying his payments, he made it to the highest honors of hackdom writing celebrities (the "seventh chamber"), where he came to be a minor celebrity himself. The scenario is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive impressive role as a cutthroat advertising agent. <br /> <br /> <p> The formula formula aside, the movie was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was the best interest in love. The rest of the support cast has done his job well. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy and well worth checking out the theaters.
