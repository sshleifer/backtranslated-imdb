I'll give it to the right ... this movie is amazing. Foreign gay films are so fast beyond American gay movie of quality acting acting and history. While many indian Indian gay films are true, bad sounds, amateur acting, line story lines, and a surprising lack of any stripping or erotica, top-quality foreign gay films are popping up as this one of France . The movie is beautiful, thought out, meaningful. The story is adult and complex (but not hard for anyone to follow), the act is intense and professional. Both the fantastic leads, as well as the entire cast. The boys are more than just good-looking and have full full nudity. you follow all the year of these boys, from the meetings to the end. All the little nuances of a relationship, the details of the fall, and out, in love have very well done. he let me want more. look at it!
