There's something about every movie "hammer" I see that really takes me into a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, nothing can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of these kinds of movies. It's adventurous fund of the occult and hypnosis brings a different kind of fantasy horror. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
