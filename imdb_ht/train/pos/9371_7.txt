One thing I still love about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. There are many twists and turns of this movie that I have a sore neck of watching. One thing I like about director Jan Dahl (Kill Me, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it can be dependent on direct and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) a good story. Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and JT Walsh the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they play characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to carry out the best of folks, and this will keep you interested, and guess, until the very end.
