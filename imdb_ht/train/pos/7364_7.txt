It's not always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time I think I've found it. She reminded me of the two movies: Trainspotting (small criminals who scored some drugs and made some stupid things in Schotland) and the Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). <br /> It's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them coming out of jail, the other one was not caught again. With a stolen vehicle driven into Scottish land, but running out of petrol. As they try to get some fuel, they find a firm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to steal him and point to a gun at one of them. Spend all things go wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a hunting person in the fields and woods of Schotland. Two friends literally have to run for their lives. Apparently this film was shot in only 12 days time. OK, that's not exactly incredible because the bigger part of it is still in the same place: the Scottish country, but I still find that quite amazing. Especially because this is not actually a bad movie. It's possibly not the greatest movie ever, but still be proud of what they are accomplishing. I had a nice time watching her and in general I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
