........... like I was when I saw this film) I will never watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scares me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English professor decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we have read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class have been terribly when the Black Woman comes to the window and floats on the kidd's bed, although, just before there's something too scary for you, that's when Kidd finds the game soldier under his pillow, and he hears the voice of a child saying "Be yours". That scene always made me today, almost 7 years after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
