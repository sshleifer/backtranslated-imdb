Just keep it in the Toronto Film Festival Festival. This is a good story, said in a compelling way. The portable camera approach to scene action adds to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not a Witch Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a great budget for producing a film to attack. The actors were strong, particularly the actor playing focused on the events of the movie, Boz.
