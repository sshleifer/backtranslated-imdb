This is a dramatic dramatic dramatic drama. It's not really a horror film so people looking for something like the ring or the steam will be disappointed. What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to details of the plot and the effort was made to be consistent internally. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or new age revisionism. Rather than advancing an agenda, the filmmakers just told the story, said it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreams were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective. A great example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, without great studio, star actor, great name director (this was far better than many of Hitchcock's films), special effects or "smart" twists trace.
