This photograph was from 1975 and was the second in the series of three parts of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser was wearing a hospital bed after him and his wife who died on Sunday morning drive. After Pusser restored it after the men who killed his wife. Will Pusser be able to complete the revenge that it is after or make the crowd attempt to take it out before it's successful. The only thing that bothered me about this picture was that this was a true true story. How could you leave in a city with this kind of crime and yet do nothing to it. Since there was no name actress in this picture I can not give it 10 Weasel stars but I can give 8
