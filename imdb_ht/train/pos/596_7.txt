This made for the TV version of the legendary stand against hopeless hopes is much more objective, more realistic than earlier earlier filmed versions of the events, though the one movie made after this was gone maybe far too humidifying the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett .. The focus here is on Jim Bowie, played with sharp detachment, cinematic by James Arness who apparently still lives at age 85. Then, 65, he make a comeback acting after years away from the screen to do this part. Puerto Rican born of Raul Julia Humanity There is Santa Ana as there is no one since J. Carol Naish back to '54 made. However, the Mexican dictator is described as a universal, universal, never seen before or since. He received excellent advice from European officers he had hired but convinced of his own inability, he did not listen to it. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the actor of one of the age-appropriate characters he plays: Col William Travis. Its painting is reliable. It is almost in awe of the older men who share orders with him. One note of jarring was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a caponskin cap and carrying Betsy Ol ', she broke off as if she was running out of another movie. With no penalties in the painting, the character is reduced to a few step conventions. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical fact neglected or suppressed in earlier movie versions. We learn that Jim Bowie was, in Santa Ana, fighting his own brother-law. The Mexican soldiers fell apart because they were armed with rifles leaving from the Napoleonic Wars a much earlier generation. "Santa Ana loves a bargain." Bowie wryly explains. The whole project of defending the ancient Spanish mission as a military fort was mentally ill - a fact explored at the highest film depth in the 2004 "Alamo".
