I'll start by saying that this has undeservedly be hanged by just about everyone! The fact is that he was not what someone was expecting, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone was expecting was a genuine cock and good a covered coverage "Do you like Dag?" etc., but this is far more mature than his previous work. I would agree that it is confusing, but all the facts have for us we just have to see and listen harder, this movie requires all your attention! Looking past the cool and dazzling of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire their performance and I think we'll all get a more complete understanding of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Yes this has its influence from modern classic (fight club, kaka fiction etc.) but it is in the whole original in both directions and rhythms with a second score score of none. I feel that if everyone is watching this movie over and over would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and I also hope Ritchie continues in this prosperous way away from this mockney "chief".
