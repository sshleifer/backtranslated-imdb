This is the film for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a neutral atmosphere in post-war Germany completely captivating. You get absorbed in the dream and you will let go only in the end credit. The plot necessarily comes second, but it is still a thrilling story and difficult issues have been raised. Just wonderful.
