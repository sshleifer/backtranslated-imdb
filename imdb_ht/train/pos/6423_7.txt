This film is an awesome non-stop stupid laugh incorporate all the usual ingredients into a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling hero, buffoonish character supported, made-up dolls for heroines, nasty villains, wisecracks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in the double role of policemen and comrades. The heroine of the Amitabh Cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposed to the Govinda Cop. The eroines are only red-etched accessory as usual. The cows do not have any heroine. Paresh Rawal brought his villain into DAUD forward (He also played a similar donation to KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani shines in a short run. He made a retweet about his famous "Intention to Zamaane Jailer" acting in SHOLAY. Govinda is impeccable as usual - like a wisecracking, good-anime policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan. She imitates Bihari style in Hindi talking to hilarious outcomes. Amitabh Bachchan, believes he or she does not, in comparison with him. But AB is good. Madhuri Dixit makes a comedy as herself in the song "Makhna". It dances like winds. Viju Shah's music is awesome. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the scenario is in comfort completely. Just enjoy yourself.
