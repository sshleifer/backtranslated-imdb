'Rene Virgo' is a story of young boy falling in love while staying in the ocean. I do not mean the draw, because it's not that most important about this movie (but you can make sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is the cinematography. The visual side of 'Presque Rien' is so amazing she deserves to score higher. It leaves you seduced with its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it shows in uneven, rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology nor have the answer to all the film issues of wear. But this is what makes 'Presque Rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all people around the artistic side of film very important and will not be disappointed.
