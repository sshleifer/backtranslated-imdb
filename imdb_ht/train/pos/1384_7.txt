Also known as "Water Lilies" this film tells stories of the two girls as they struggle in the world of love and sex. This story is said at a slow pace and works very well. It provides plenty of time and space to find different characters and grow a little bit attached to them. <br /> Use a small throw to put some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen than normal, but the people playing in this movie touch that well. Everyone is completely credible. Visual environment is great, especially the underwater shots of the pool adds a nice effect. Many films are made on the subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them. He pulls some "standard" pressure methods from the high hat and work on them. It's not bad, not all, but surely it's not big night and I feel it could do better if it took some less exploring angles. <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
