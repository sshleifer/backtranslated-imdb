After seeing this film at the Independent SF Festival Festival, I could not wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q & A) on the film following his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a movie that shows minority (women, non-white) working on resolving controversial issues (newspaper pregnancy , youth maternity, racial identity, one-mother), and how to write a faithful script on all the subjects of being a Mid-Thirty White Man. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly adult-raved on the film's fantastic scenario, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of "real-life teenagers." Most of the youth, however, left the building - leading me to think this is a movie that is best seen by adults and children, as a starting point for discussions rather than, as many adults felt, "a young The film should be seen because it's about to be. "So, the question of distribution - how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a movie that will be buried, like "Pups" or other radical modern teen movie - and McKay seemed to respond. As for his credit as a writer / director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work - allies himself in the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to show characters in their own vision of what they think should be - and the results being disarmingly realistic.
