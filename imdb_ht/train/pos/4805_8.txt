when I first heard about this movie I thought it would be like the Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of Young Victoria I knew this would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also nice shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really left me is their performance. Emily Blunt (The Devil Put Prada) is the star of the movie, bringing Victoria to life and this movie shows she is a great actress and maybe picking an Oscar nomination nominal for her performance. Rupert Friends is almost crushed as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although I expect more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supported the role of forgettable. For me the movie feels like finishing. Maybe the screenwriters change a lot of the script, I do not know but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> But in general it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria and a Great Performance from Emily Blunt.
