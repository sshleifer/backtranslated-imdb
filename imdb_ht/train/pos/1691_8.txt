This movie is funny and suitable for any age. It is definitely family-type entertainment. Throw to perform a good job playing as in the mid-west city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume anything never happened since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is new (and only) ramps from the Interstate. The place of appeal as decently boring and totally easy for the invasion of the earth by the Martyrs. But these martians are totally stupid, despite being well equipped with a ghastly and very dangerous weapon arsenal ... including a series of eliminate martians, too! The Marians are dead-cornered lines and throw in just the right accents to make us viewers and locals want to help them ... leave the earth. J. Anderson plays very young Halloween carnival rides just great lines. Watch this movie for forests and entertainment; thought-provoking is not. But subtle and enjoyable it is.
