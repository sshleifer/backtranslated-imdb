I have never heard of the book, nor her care, but the movie I'll probably see many times. <br /> This film is unforgettable and perhaps the richest imagery I've ever seen in a movie. It was as if I was looking at painting many times, which I think was the idea. <br /> <br /> Terrorist movie, story, actor, and cinematography. Full of deep emotions from all angles. Although I'm not particularly fond of romance movies, I liked this and was deeply moved by Winona Ryder's prayer to her father at the end. Irons deserve a premium for its performance and closing was never better. <br /> <br />
