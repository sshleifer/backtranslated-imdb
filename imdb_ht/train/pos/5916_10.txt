I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin '), a night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), admitting the characters to the characters is a bit rude and bloody today, but I think it is a Satir and a very, very unrealistic story of the old Remus Uncle history of the American Black Culture, creating right down to the main characters and the shake Blatant of the "Tar Tar" and the "Briar Patch." These are not grandoted stories, ideas, but cultural icons created by Black Americans, and I've been a white woman and love these stories. And I also found it an interesting look at the time-capsule about the black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70's. <br /> <br /> Well to get to nitty-bravest in this movie: This movie is a live- action / animated film, which begins in live action with a fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and The preaching (Charles Gordone) hastens to help their friends, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escaped from prison, but stopped by a blockade and wind up in a shooting with the police. While waiting for them, Randy says Pather's Pather (Scatman Crothers), as it begins to tell Randy's story to host the Rabbit Brother, a new youngster in the big city that quickly rises from the obscure to all Harlem rules ; You know, my Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the preaching. A juxtaposed abstract of stylized animation and live action animation, the film is a saturated graphics and condemnation of prevalent stereotypes in the 70s. racial, ethnic, and otherwise. <br /> So, anyway, it's another good Bakshi movie; And do we have to sweep the movie like this under the carpet? do they pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think that would be a shame; I think we should watch these intact films, and learn about what goes on back then, just how far we come since then.
