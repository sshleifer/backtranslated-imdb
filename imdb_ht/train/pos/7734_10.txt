I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this unusual role that he played the director? I'm not too much on it ... and I do not care.The scenario is good, that's to ensure. In just a few words I must say about this movie that is strange, weird, even black, but it's a good. I've seen it a few years ago and never saw it since then I want to see it again and again. I know that I will not get sick of watching it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors , the story ... everything is good. The film has to last longer I think the 120 minutes should be perfect. I was hoping for a party 2 for this bad movie.Too it did not happen. Jason Patric: you're the man! very good movie. in the end. :-)
