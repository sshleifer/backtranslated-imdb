I'm usually skeptical about watching movie or mini-series based on novels because the scenario is still different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! Just was very close to the novel (I guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. I can not describe how much I enjoyed seeing as a bunch of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The place of setting ... I was hoping to see the houses and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was a little different. However, it was not enough to make me the mini-set flu. <br /> I recommend this to anyone who read the novel: you will not be ashamed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
