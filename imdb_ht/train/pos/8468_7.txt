A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. There's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. Hearts are very subtle, by pressing the jump-offs that seem to be the most popular Asian horror films. The "crises" to create are similar to the disturbing moments of the "Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong Shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly the same gauge. The film does a great job in balancing a classic ghost story and something that is most unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance.
