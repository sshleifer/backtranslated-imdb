I rent this for my son who recently got interest in 9/11. It was a Kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding. I love the way he says as a "documentary." If there was one movie that I would recommend to see about 9/11, this would be the one! Normally you see a movie she has well-known actors. This movie had no one known. Also, you see a movie about 9/11, you hear about a fire-fighter or two lost lives to save people. I did not feel this was any of that! I only rent this movie and I would definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done! My heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims 9/11!
