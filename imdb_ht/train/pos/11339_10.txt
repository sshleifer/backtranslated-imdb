Anyone who has experienced the horrors of divorce will empathize with this independent movie protagonist, a little frightened boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a fascinating Anthony DeMarco) simply "transmitting" the shock of two brickering parents in an understandable image? Or does the animal be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and holds the puzzle audience. His choice of using one setting - a suburban home - adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very compelling as angry, but their parents love. However it is the minor clerk characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), an unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sleazy Real Estate Agent who is delaying the mind. Jake's Closet is a portrait of darkness inspired by infancy as a special kind of hell.
