Wow, this was another good turn off of the original American pie, not as good as band strip, but definitely a lot better the naked mil. Dwight and Erik Stifler led the comedy of this one, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one of the naked miles. The script was written a lot better with the comedy flow more smoothly, however most of the comedy came from sex, but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right? <br /> <br /> The midget rock also had a really good cum, considering the intense effort given to him in the nude milestone, his scene and stifler was awesome and was laughing at my ass when I was see it. /> <br /> The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile, if you liked any movie before the American movie, you should love the beta house, unless you see all Americans spin a turn waste of money.
