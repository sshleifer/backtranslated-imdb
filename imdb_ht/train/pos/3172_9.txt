First? Wow - Cross-eyed is one of the most enjoyable indirect films that I've been looking at over the past year, making it hard to believe that Eyed Cross is the first movie writer. I mean - I'm looking at IMDb to get more films by this writer ... because Cross Eyed has unique signature - you want to see what else this writer might say. These days, its scarce has seen a well-written, well-directed, well edited and well-acting movie. For me - Cross Eyed imposed that film making should be over - combining best of all movie elements to create a smart, artistic and intelligent story. More, please.
