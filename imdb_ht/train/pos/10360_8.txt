This is a docudrama story about Lindy Chamberlain's case with a view of its impact on Australian society. It especially appears in the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectations when dealing with real-life drama. <br /> One story of the story deals and is the way that he hopes people will all be giving the same emotional response to the same situation. Not everyone goes wild wild melodramatic to every major crisis. Just because the characters in movies and TV act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially just for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the great sob scenes that will pull the ratings. It is a problem that must be addressed regularly. <br /> <br /> Driving to play the characters and depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are skillfully supported by a great cast of all-based players. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the support cast in this story are the best known people in Australia as a comic actor. It reappears my idea that funny actors do some of the best supports in play because and the comedians know how to establish quick impressions of people. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning!) <br /> I must say something very personal here; in that I actually was an ancient Adventist who was a member of the United States at that time the incident occurred; So I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think that the best scene is one where the couple are hiding by the new drivers. He captured the terms of the brilliant story. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for the characters they could." While this is especially just for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should be applied to all acting as well.
