The first one saw this film in 1990, and absolutely died laughing at her. It has become a favorite cult and my circle of friends, and we would mention it in the drop of a hat ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition in the time of Halloween exposed many of my new friends to this movie (good thing you can always buy it at Ebay!) I found that Halloween candy tastes better and the tongue you planted firmly in your penis This movie gives it all - pathos, suspense, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano gives an amazing heartfelt performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in the "7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. Here, you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will miss some of the humor levels in this movie. The creators got real subtle in many ways and comment comments, little dig subtle costumes of other sci-fi movies, and even a torn scene from the pages of Will E. Coyote! <br /> Do not pass too many Thinking processes are trying to analyze a movie, people - this is fun farefoot without the need for nitpicking, and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people but they will not know they're mocking ..). <br /> -Now if you will excuse me, I'll go to a bar 'Zag-black' .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / host
