I will begin by pointing my first encounter with Prince's music. She was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl dancing to "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I said it was Prince. It was so good that she distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. Then I started to hear other Prince songs and really "searched" them. When the red rain came out I always knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I immediately became Principle No 1 fan of the "baby war" generation. Later I found out one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and he got me, and my nephew at a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sit next to her mother ... how cool this is! When you come back to the subject, I agree with Siskel & Ebert called Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it about 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought that the Prince had acted fine, Apollonian struggled a bit, but all of the act was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play the 'Kid' so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly rhythm (it never gets slower), and terrificly directed. I rank it among the movie musicals of all time. The last time I looked it was after a 7-year difference and it was still delivered. I'm so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would like to tell him personally. He walked right before me during the above concert mentioned, saying, "Hi", in my nephew, but not me. He argued with his mother. I was a little broken but it's still No. 1 with me.
