I was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that he still lived in my mind as one of these memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il State of a Man's Fault ..., most of which I love). I find that other Japanese similar designs of this type published later can not match Mazinger Z, as they started boringly repeating the same pattern. <br /> <br /> That's very much, the gift, can be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is to invent it, with many unusual monsters, unusual devices and rare characters; Actually, we've been looking forward to seeing each new installment to find out what kind of new car or car has been waiting for you!
