This film came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well actually I look at both the Simpsons and Futurama and it's a mention of both so I figured out "what the heck". The film brings home a few "if that" makes you realize how lucky we are on this day and age where we take such simple things as soap and water for granted. Interestingly though that in the year 2022 people are still shabby and one razor razor safety! Nice that the Guardian did not overload the movie with special unnecessary effects, ray gun, etc. Some nice 'furniture' will look once you know what it means. Remember, "Tuesday is Green Soylent Day"
