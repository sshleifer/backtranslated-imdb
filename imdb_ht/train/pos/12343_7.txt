Artistic speaking, this is a beautiful movie - the movie, music and costumes are gorgeous. In fact, this movie is more beautiful than what has been led by Akira Kurasawa himself. In that case, he only wrote the movie as he did several years after his death. <br /> So, as far as the writing, the dialogue was well written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways - after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It is interesting that although prostitution was seen as a more acceptable business in Japan, women are always long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie films in shame, though Streets of shame are a lot less likable and more one dimension. So in general it gets a 7 - mainly due to everything, but the writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this film is the story by the great Kurasawa.
