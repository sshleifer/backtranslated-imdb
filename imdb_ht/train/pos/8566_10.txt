I really like 101 Dalmations when it came from 1996, now 5 years later I went to 102 slimming in 2001, I thought it was fantastic but I think 101 is better because I think it's more funnier, plus Humor, and also the movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one slang (1961) I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there, maybe yes, maybe not have none, all of us slumber fans will have to find if there will be 103 gusts in the future.
