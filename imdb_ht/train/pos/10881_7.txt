"Cut" is a full-scale parody of the slasher genre and in the main it realizes what he sets out to do. Most of the standard slasher clich√©s are there; The old creepy house, the woods, the anonymous indigenous killer assassin, bucket of gurus, and of course the couple cut by the killer while they're gender (this hardly a shovel). -up is simplicity itself: movie-nerd nerd set out to complete a slasher finish "masterpiece", ending because of the murder of a couple of the cast. This is also noticeably - okay, messily - thrown at Kylie Minogue in the first coil. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original movie, played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely robbed the movie because it gets all the best lines. The rest of cast fit their role well, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it right while the destruction and gore burst around. There are many red herrings and suspectful moment moments, and there is very little time to try to work on who the killer is because the movie moves at a fast speed. It also has a low budget budget, including some clumsy corrections that are probably deliberate. Good band, too. If there is a difficulty with this movie it will decide whether it's a sent-up or homage of the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
