I do not think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it when presenting the depth of the characters and the plot is not all twists and turns keep you on the edge of your place. <br /> But what this movie has: an interesting study of how families deal with grief. How when the tongue for healing and over-tremendous losses leave us dumb, and we rely on raw emotions rather. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the movie is given more than just sharing it in it. He eventually left and moved in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who made it clear to him that he was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew in his heart, but he needed to hear these words from their parents, and to receive forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: lack of dialogue. There was a tremendous childhood on physical reactions, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really look at the reactions of the actors. Something we do not get much of today's movie. <br /> <br />
