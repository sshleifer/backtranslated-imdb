... and the series lets you forget everything. I am about three years older than children described in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and I received the first post-college college graduation during the second fuel shortage in 1979. 70's was a really dreadful time to be young - inflation, competition for minimal after-school -Working jobs with set-off thirty-somethings, awful music, clothes worse. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, this series does not ignore any of that and still manages to make fun of the 70's, even for those of us old enough to know better. She managed to look at the 70s directly in the face - complete with time-authentic dress - and yet complete the show with young people's hopes and things that make high school and college years both better at times and the worst at times. Then there are parents. Two young lovers of the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have the terrible parents and the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60 were finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who were waiting for the 1960s to show their whole lives in order to give their unusual legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, quite incompetence, and snobbishness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show on the suburbs, but it largely represents someone who has to play the cards he faced even when those four were hugely hugged and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight episodes though eight seasons lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.
