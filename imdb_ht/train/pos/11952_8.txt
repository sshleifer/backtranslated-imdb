Skoup *** from **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I enjoyed "Point Match." It was a beautiful romantic romantic movie that chuckily was not Woody Allen star. She had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in her. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and though she looks at this one, she's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and two of them perfect work together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the effect of a lifetime from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe hears the effect while on a boat and gripping into the pit and a bunch of souls in others The Reaper was taken. One of these is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) He told Joe that Peter could be the killer in roaming series of streets in England. Joe, with the effect of a lifetime, travels back to the living and gives this information to Sondra, during a magical act. Sondra is in some magic shows and Sid Waterman magician (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer going to a missing box and while in the box she gets to the visit of Joe. Not knowing what to do, he encouraged South Waterman's help to help him crack the case. <br /> This film has a nice light-feeling feeling in it compared to "Point Match" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's Humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the "suspect" assassin series. <br /> <br /> This is a little movie fun to see if you ever look for one look. Together they throw works well with the story flowing and you sometimes forget about watching Woody Allen be himself. I say it gives a chance because you just love it.
