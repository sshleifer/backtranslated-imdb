This movie is funny, good, and easy to become a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious story lessons so I simply accept it as is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, does well, Hank Martin, who is not accidentally transported back to another age, the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Aliseand, or Sandy, the object of Hank's affection although it is brushed into the brave and horrible arm Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> I just love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up in tattered clothes and take in the high road and the knapsacks experience the kingdom of eye. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we're not alone" while giving her scruffy clothes a good scruff, is one of the hilarious moments in the movie. William Bendix's paintings are superbly ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at strange "Ye Old English." <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It's great family entertainment too. <br /> <br />
