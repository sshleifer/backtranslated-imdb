This movie is a great way to finish the series. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) is all grown and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl came to destroy the puppets and learn the Toulon's secret but instead listened to the story about the puppets. Most of this film is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and retro puppet master (sorry ... But I guess Paramount would not let them use scene from 1). Personally I Wish Puppet Vs. Demonic games would ultimately have to make but the way the movie ends are basically saying "This is the final movie in the series ..."
