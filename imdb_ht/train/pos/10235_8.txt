An unusual film of Ringo Lam and the one of strangely under-appreciated. The mixture of fantasy kung-fu and a more realistic illustration of the sword and spear of the body driving is especially alarming during the first ten minutes. A horse rider gets cut in two with his waist and holds the horse ride. Several horses get cut up. It's very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazy crazy general and prison in the Red Lotus Temple that seems to be more of a torture room then a temple. The general has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he sprouts the deformation of filth and makes scary and human pain. <br /> <br /> The output is very impressive and the environment is weak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time. Sometimes the movie films of absurdity or effects are cheesy, but it's never bad enough to break the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this one, it's one of the best HK Kung Fu films from the early nineties. Just remember it's not friendly kids.
