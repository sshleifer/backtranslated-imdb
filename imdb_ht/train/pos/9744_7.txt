"Yes, Georgio" is a light / interesting and enjoyable movie with beautiful environments and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviews suggest if one wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they might be best served by picking up a DVD opera. Although, a full opera might be a better representation of the Pavarotti's operational talent, often, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice voice and shows a personality and character in the way a opera would not. <br /> <br /> Many reviews seemed to find the incredible story; I do not agree. Large talent people can be both self-centered and spacious - spacious enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people very different from another often get overhead and grow in positive ways from communicating with those who stretch them or take them in the direction they might not choose independently. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unknown parts of themselves in relation to the other. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself go to a visually rewarding and rewarding movie with Pavarotti's peak in its vocal abilities. The end performances from Turandot Puccini alone are worth the time to get there.
