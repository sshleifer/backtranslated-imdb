Diagnostic Diagnosis is one of the only programs I watch regularly on television now. Ways of all the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes to make it so unlike today's show where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is pushing on the side. The way the brain moves the way is so dark that you never really know what it is thinking, and if you think you are doing, you're wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder has tackled a variety of diverse topics, not only in cases but in each of the personal life characters. Everything comes from racism and adoption, terrorism and technology. How was it for old people? I am 24 !! I do not think I can be considered old again. <br /> I just want to know when they are releasing all 8 episodes on DVD (by NTSC) so I can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing it with many other programs in the same time so they can hurry up a bit!
