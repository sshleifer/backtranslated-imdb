Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the movie, essentially a movie about a Hispanic / American girl who moves in Spain and her mother at the time of Hispanic Civil War. It turns out, the mother goes home to die, and is left with his grandfather. It also makes friends with many experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at the forefront of his nuisance then gets close. The film is beautifully shot, bathing in soft colors especially. Carol is surprised by his father, who is a pilot of the war, and you can feel the love for him. While the war itself is kind of takes a back seat of this movie, it wraps the character's life. I think you'll love it. Watch it especially for Clara Lago, who does a good job as Carol. It is definitely one to look.
