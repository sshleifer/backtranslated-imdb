The title exists the content of this film a bit, which could lead to some unrealistic expectations. Frankly speaking, there are very few "panic on the streets" to be seen here. In fact, throughout the movie very few people actually know that there is a loose murderer that may well spread the epidemic of everyone and anyone he meets. After saying that, what we do is a very well-done story with a level of suspension that starts out reasonably high anyway (because, unlike the people "on the streets", the viewer knows what happens) and that director Elia Kazan builds a lot. As the infected epidemic assassins are looking, one of the more exciting framing I found was the relationship developed between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Captain Warren Police (Paul Douglas). At the beginning, the two really do not like each other, even though they have to work together. In the end, they were forcing a real bond in respect of each other. Kazan has done a great job with that. Pretty much of all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was well taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little criticism here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came as a little dish as Nancy Reed's wife, but her role was not really central to the story. All in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10
