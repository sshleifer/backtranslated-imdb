"Now in India's centime, where I used to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her Majesty the queen .." So go the famous poem puppet by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal framework on which the film "Gunga Din" is based. If you are fortunate enough to watch this legendary classic, you will enjoy the way films used to make them; for the absolute fun. It comes from the script of the novelist and poet, this is a story of a native native named Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as 'a Regular Beast' during the British occupation in India during The 18th century. Her bigger desire is to become a soldier. The Water Boy is part of a Kalvary Calendar Container threatening and killed by a notorious culinary culture in Kali called the 'Thuggee.' Three particular soldiers stand out from this company who noted for their courage and comradeship. First is beautiful and debonair, Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Kouto. Next is Victor McLaglen as vigorous. MacChesney and finally there's flamboyant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three and their fellow soldiers were surrounded by a hedge of stranglers mountain led by the leader of the band called 'Guru' (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the chaos of war, the brave water-boy is hoping to earn somewhere in the army by playing a bugle he found. A solid story for an old black and white film that needs little fanfare for anyone looking to enjoy a classic. ****
