I waited briefly to post a review of this documentary because when I saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> I found in a documentary viewpoint that this is a darn good documentary. He did what he set out to do, showing me something I had no idea about and holding me interested in this world he explored. I did not know anything in the world to drag and get out on them and the "bubbles" were just spectacular to me. These people were just so talented and what they did and how they did it for competition. The Catty people complained (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the Queen of the Dragon dragon was wearing a man's garment!), Jealous, it's all like in each other's competition. Like any other competition like it. Which I felt was a point. <br /> You've got the queen's queen to talk about how the "used" bumps to be compared to the most recently dragged queens that have changed their ball and made more competition categories - and even those who are aware of the future The ball would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the competitors were living out on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to compete, it was important! Then there was sad story, story in which the "house" and "mother's house" carried out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting. <br /> Now, after 10 years of adding to this film, I lived in the so-called 'Madonna' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary that ended with Madonna during his "vogue" phase and just so. If not for these people, Madonna would not have had a "vogue" phase, I know now. Credit should be provided where credit is DUE. Make me wonder if anyone else from mainstream America would look at this documentary, they will be taught not as "mainstream" as they think.
