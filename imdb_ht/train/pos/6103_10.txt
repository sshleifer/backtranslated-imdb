I saw the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very fun and is something I believe the world, and black America is ready to see. He has comedy, drama, the band is great. It's an all around good movie. Characters have been well developed, and the film has a wide variety of important actors, such as Wood Harris (Remembering Titles, Paying In Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000), and the Wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline , Pirates of the Caribbean). The film tackles many important topics in today's society in a short period of time, and doing so with class and grace. This is not just a story about life at the hospital, however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are, or who they are going to be.
