seriously I liked this movie..and started reading the book and i loved it ... the way everything was up and everything was a goal ... i think that movie was doing that well was because Louis Sachar wrote the scenario. and of course Andrew Davis directed her ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for her first film ... The story is very cool and exciting ... there are humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book I found this movie to be not least bit boring ... I absolutely love it ... and I encourage anyone to read the book .. all through this movie is very well put together crafted ... of thumbs up for me in every single way
