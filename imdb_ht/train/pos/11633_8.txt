Eye Red is not the kind of movie that will be to have Palme D', but Wes Craven has never been the kind of director, anyway, and branding it is a good indication of what a movie-goer can expect. > <br /> The fact that red eye is a little tight, undemanding pack of 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's craft in lightweight, but generally enjoyable, fare office boxes. In fact, it's the perfect type of movie to show as entertainment, attention-keeping entertainment without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer. In general, there is a cheesy feel on the field, the wave of substratum terrorism motivation and characters are supported, and the main section has a feeling of TV movie. However, there are definite elements of Hitchcockian's suspicions, and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and firefighting) play on the same idea of ​​emotional crisis being played out to suppress the public. For a movie focused mainly on two people sitting in place of plane, he lives or dies on the characters and script. The Cactus Ice, but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams Lisa's resources are the main reasons the film has brought in. Not only do the dialogue but also give some sort of dimension to the Ribbinian Adam in the battles of 'male logic' against 'feminine sensitivity'. In the final portion of the movie Craven indulges himself a little scream style as man-chases-girl-and-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the 'Just for Men' treatment, its ubiqutous appearance of various films as Super Troupe, the Ring and what makes it the sexiest version of Jude Law. /> Short haul fun.
