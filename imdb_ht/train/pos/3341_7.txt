I saw this film on Thursday night after a really boring day. I had no expectations, those I had had rather negative. Being the only movie I've ever looked at Jimmy is the American version of Taxi and Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so nice! Drew Barrymore is still sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet a nice nerd like that. :) Movies like these are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on a Thursday. I'm not even a fan of sports, but it's something about American movies and baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we do not have sports here in Norway. <br /> (first my comment ever.) Haha
