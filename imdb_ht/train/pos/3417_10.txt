Before seeing this, I was removed from the subject, but this is not your average triumph over storytelling. Although this is technically on blind infant mortar climbing MT. Everest, there is much more to it. This movie shows very strong, the often contradictory personality of two adult blindly leading children, Erik and Sabers. Erik is a mountain climber / Indian blindman and Saber is a German German blind who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own way, but agree on what will really build confidence in their children. Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabers want them to enjoy Erik as a role model and have fun at the moment. The nuances are complicated and one walk goes by really being sure who was good or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan kids themselves and the challenges they face before finding their way to school. Most moving for me was the story of Tashi, a vulnerable teenager who grew up in the streets after her parents abandoned her. I was able to watch a whole movie about his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he is currently running a small business success with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love this.
