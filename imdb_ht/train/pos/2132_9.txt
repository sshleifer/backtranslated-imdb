The cast really helps make this a wonderful surprise with a cut above the man-vs-women-arguing-all-in-the-time-but-van-up love-type Hollywood romance / romance tournament / comedy. <br /> I usually do not go for that kind of movie with that tedious storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, with oozes and charms. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play in each other well and make a very beautiful couple. Thrust in support is exceptional - from the still-likable Felix Bressart to the villain of Joseph Schildkraut. Frank Morgan also plays one of the most exciting characters I've ever seen him doing in his career. He takes the movie and turns it into a whole different mood for a moment when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason that this movie rises above others in its kind. Again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of that. In this film, it's romance, comedy and drama and well done. I'll take this on re-performing "You were the Mail," any day. By comparison.
