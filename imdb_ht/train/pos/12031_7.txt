(WARNING: Minor defeat) <br /> I went to this part of the party and watch out there, not knowing what it was or what the draw was. It certainly kept my attention; I did not know until the end that he was based on a true story! The guy she used to make the deck out looking like a seriously cute guy who just got herself twisted around by a devious girl; I have to question how real life is imaginable. Anyone who would kill a husband and wife asleep just can not be entirely beautiful. Still, I had some sympathy for her, as she established and took advantage of; I brought my main complaint with the completion (here comes the biggest sponsor! Skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there seemed to be no way for the truth to be discovered. The road she discovered was in a "poke" operation, but my question is: how police were convinced to go along with it? The film did not show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient to absent explanation about how to take it to do it. <br /> I think the busy ways that made for dramatic reasons, as the explanation explains lent an aura of suspicion of the critical scene that otherwise would not have been (we'd already know what the scene was about, and that who went on with Brad in it). <br /> <Otherwise, this is a very good movie; I give it 7/10. She made me think. Now I'm interested in getting the information in the real case. <br /> One more thing: The movie was done in 1996. Some of the comments here seem to be treated as a most recent movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I did not see it before. It can act a little, too (always a plus in her line of work, LOL).
