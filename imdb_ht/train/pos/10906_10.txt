I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I have never been lucky to meet him but never heard anyone say a bad word about it. I hope he knows how much this program helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this horrible condition. This person has touched people in such a way that a million dollar charity could not. I believe this should be mandatory to look at the schools. I agree with other comments - what I had to moan about? He took everything that life can throw into him, he still managed to maintain a sense of humor. God bless. I could not watch the party that showed her bandage changed. I have enough problem with my son.
