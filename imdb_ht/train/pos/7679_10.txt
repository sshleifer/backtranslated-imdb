For my humanitarian project for school, I chose to conduct human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I always thought about it. All I can say is "Wow". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The finish leaves you breathless, and although it's not an endless finish, it's really realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and break your heart for her and because of her happenings. I loved it very much and now I want to know what happens next!
