EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me a bit of Warren William), the beautiful cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at an animated speed and runs just a little over an hour. Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who seems to be intent on his own (hypnotism, anyone?), And the suspects include a good amount of support - everyone from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, there is Nat Pendleton as a dummy detective - and, in addition, find a burden of decorating this decorating art for the fancy interiors of a rich home. You should be a series that is used in many of the following films. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot and reasonable assurance of being not too baffled. It all suddenly clear detective Philo Vance - and then he had a final confrontation with the murderer who gave the movie a fifty-five minutes of unknown suspicions. <br /> <br /> Nicely do and spend the time in a fun way.
