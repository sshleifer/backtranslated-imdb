I really addicted to Caprica, because it's a really good Battlestar Galactica prequel series. It really has a slow start to slow down, but surely pick up soon after new episodes continue to air. <br /> I've heard a lot about the future episodes and stars invited for the first season. <br /> <Sci Fi Drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both folks. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does an amazing job, as well as Polly Walker as Willow Clarice !! <br /> Always worth checking out !! <br /> Catch Caprica On Friday at 9 pm / 8pm central on SYFY
