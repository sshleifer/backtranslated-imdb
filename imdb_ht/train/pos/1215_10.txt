This is my favorite in the care of three cinema bearers. Again I loved all the songs. The big problem however as most people pointed out was that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the movie first remember the bears met "cousins" that they apparently never knew about. It was not until the end that the cousins ​​got their vantage symbol after they proved how much they had taken care of. In this story however the cousins ​​grow with care of bears and have symbols of stomach altogether. That said this is not a bad movie as long as you keep it apart from the first. I thought the Darkheart character much more wrong then Nicholas in the first. But at the same time I felt he added a sort of balance to the sweetness of their care. I also liked the part of our care at the end, although I know others had mixed feelings on this stage. And of course I love singing. My favorites are growing up and forever Young. Care in bringing movies has always been the good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
