Love trap is not a short, quite obviously a full-length film feature and a long run of 105 minutes. <br /> While writing this, I might as well talk a bit more about love trap. I often wonder what makes different traps ... this is how I answer the question: 1) It introduces character - one particular - that has never seen before in film, period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love, and delivers more deeply into many designs of love, than any other US film ever made, in my modest views. <br /> 3) structure, as in the way the story is said, it is unlike any love story you've ever seen. <br /> 4) It offers very timely insights on various cultural issues, both in and out of the Black Community. <br /> <Over time, people will come to see Love Traps as over as completely an original work as possible in this era, delightfully refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare morality to play full of foods for thought. Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information on this movie.
