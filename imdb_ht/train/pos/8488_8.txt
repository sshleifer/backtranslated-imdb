I just have to throw my cents in. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes for the most part the characters are widely written and acting. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new release, it's out on video and streaming on almost every week. Would I see it in a theater? Sure, I did when she first came out. It's funny ... that would be enough. Even though I did not like it at all, I would always watch it on cable for Michael Keaton. She is an actor biting and under appreciating. I can not think of another that is so capable of every genre. Nor can I think of someone who's been successful. A comedy actor who is also an action star (short live, but still), who is also a romantic lead, who is also a dramatic actor; a cruel and a hero. I can not think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly no one has succeeded in all of these. I mean there is Tom Cruise but I read the best of being Tom Cruise than becoming a character. However this is not about Michael Keaton vs Tom Cruise so I'll move on. Gung Ho is worth leasing, its excuse is worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less in stores like Wal-Mart. It's worth watching on cable (if you have cable or satellite). It is one of those who enjoy watching movies. You can put your brain on pause, and just relax, and chuckle away. To ask for more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.
