The 12th Disney Disney Classic is a reasonable film said in a simple story. Though a small date, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classic. <br /> It's not among Disney's top job, but is satisfied. One of the most "simple" Disney works, yes, but holds a certain magic and magic (which old Disney is well-known for). This was an important movie because it saved Disney out of a delicate situation. If this was a failure, there would have been any more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somehow as a return to the 1st Disney animated classic ("Snow White and Seven Nose") because it brings back genre of fairy tale. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I think it's a place in France because this is based on a story by Charles Perrault. There are many unmatched characters, such as Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy stepmother (for a sure make sure it's funny), the birds, the King and the Grand Duke . <br /> <br /> Jaques is very clever and entertaining. I love his voice. Really have that kind of mouse-like. Gus might not be that spirit, but it's funny. <br /> <br /> The King is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his short temper. The Grand Duke is a very cool and funny hat too. They're two of my favorite characters in this movie and are responsible for many of the most fun moments. The Prince is certainly the best one in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this masterpiece, because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (motherboard) would not be supposed to be because she was cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughter (Anastacia and Drizella) are no better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughter. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, beautiful and lovable. By the way, I think beautiful pink dress is more beautiful than one given in the Fairy Tail. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously bad. The road she walks, sticks up her nose in the air and the arrogant and facial expressions make her funny. Ironically it is very like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitude toward Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because it is like a devilish cat and mean. But there is nothing annoying about it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple, but beautiful, although not the best Disney. The best song of this film is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". There are many well-known voice actors in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. Although being simple-looking, the film has good artwork, as well as its beautiful details, although never something "out-of-the-world". However, the royal palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.
