Yes, it's a bit of a funny movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget about this one ... but if you like Jan Candy's humor, this is a must-see. We lost John Candy before he made enough of his great comedy brand, and it is only the best of a movie: Plan, Trains, & Automobiles (and Steve Martin). Excellent performance supported by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever as the warm-headed DiPasquale Room. Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. You must view this dark and out-of-print movie if you are a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan.
