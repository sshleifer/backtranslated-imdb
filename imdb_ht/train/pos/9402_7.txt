I saw this film only after hearing raids on it for years. Needless to say, the current experience proved somewhat anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly, though formulated, bold industrial post-WWII England. This is the story unfamiliar to the misery of inventing the perfect product every day. Remember the car that runs over water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In that case, it's a fabric that does not expel, wrinkle, or even get dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and workers are afraid of the prospect of being driven out of business, and so the plot becomes a bit thick. Guiness makes the whole entertaining enterprise, and watching him blow up a factory research lab on them and over again is quite an explosion! (These brits ... still rigid in the air when under fire.) The film might be chug along just like Guiness's jumping invention, but it's a good ride all the same.
