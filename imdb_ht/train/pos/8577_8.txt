I think Hollow Point is a funny movie and some good moments I've never seen before in action movies. Well, both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are not so good at acting, but Tia Carrere is beautiful and charming looking girl, is not it? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role-so crazy gangster.
