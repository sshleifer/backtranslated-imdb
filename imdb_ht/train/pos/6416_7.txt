Men at Honor Star Cuba Buy Jr., as real life marine Diver Carl Brashear challenged Marine a man to become the first African American marine diver. Sometimes in his side, and sometimes his enemy was one person Carl Brashear really admired. His name is Master Chief of Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in a lot of ways pushes, aggravates and helps Carl become the man he wants to be. I loved Cuba in this movie. His portraiture here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in the hurricane. Through each stage we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to realize his dream. We can see the struggle in her as she enters her father's pride. I also liked how the director created and brought a lot of tension to some of the key dive scenes. Brashear's meeting with a submarine during a rescue mission is heart-stopping and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only fault I could see would be to lay down in the support. Cuba and DeNiro characters are very complicated and interesting to watch. Which makes you a little sad when they are head butt with these two-dimensional support characters. Lt. the sick. Hanks, Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), the Universal Colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba's favorite interest is the character I found not very much in depth. What could make these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop. Why was Colonel still in his tower? How was Sunday's wife so bitter and always drinking? <br /> <br /> Another curious question must do that. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean if this movie is chronically life this man would not marry it be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men Honor, however, is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops. This movie will inspire and make you feel for the man's fight. What I believe was the reason that this powerful story was said. My hat goes to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
