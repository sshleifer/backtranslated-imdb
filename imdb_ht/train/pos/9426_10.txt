This is one of the FRI series ever! I laughed until my side split and rolled around on the floor. If only one would drop in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> I know being released in the UK but this Region 2 and PAL exclusive! Let's make this series shake its assets. America should know this series. Moffat is a genius. I liked the original Tracie Bennett's role in this. Of course I love Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> Release this show in America! or Show it again on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please appreciate us, please! Please! Thanks for it.
