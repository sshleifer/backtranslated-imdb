An axial second installment that is managed to be the same as the first. <br /> Once again, the casting is just wonderful. I love how the first and second episode has nothing in common except for the understanding and intelligence. The second episode is just very funny, very funny and very enjoyable. She is the very first episode of Christmas, about a woman who suffers from a serious assassin dress up like Santa after she kills her own husband. Just like the first episode; kama. The most funny scene is a tie between the husband's assassination and calling his phone, first frightening him until it becomes real.
