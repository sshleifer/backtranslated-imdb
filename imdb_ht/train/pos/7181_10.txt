Ayline has torn nearly 6000 years ago in Egypt. Really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century. I also did not realize the flopped series. Is there a second expiration season now is not there? It's amazing for me when the reviews are made by people who are ill-informed or do not watch a show at all. It's a waste of space on the boards and in the other time. The first show in the series was perhaps a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but this is to be expected at any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can hardly wait for the second season to start in the United States.
