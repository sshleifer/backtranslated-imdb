I still enjoy seeing movies that make you think, and not just drip-eating the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of the films, and quite a lot of reporters have stated that it's hard to follow, with a bit of concentration and an open mind I've got it. First Time. True, it does not compare with other mind-mugs like "Suspicious Teaching" or "Memento", but in its own right an intelligent and think-provoking movie. <br /> Another thing I really like about this movie is how beautifully it is. Each scene, each camera angle seems to have been thinking about for ages. If you see it you will know what I mean. <br /> So, conclude ... watch it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, well, no-one ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
