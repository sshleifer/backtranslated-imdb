When it comes to erotic genre, I'm lucky to get in the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something to look. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I like you do not touch me) led two actors lead actor Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this enthralling thriller. Kira is convinced as "Kim" romance romance innocent romance that gets caught up in the internet in the seduction of Jeffery Doug in the "Man" of a beautiful stranger. Kira lost control over inhibiting it in the role, and as actress, giving what could simply be another T with a depth and credibility. I believe it to be his best performance again. With Julie Davis' direction is a great erotica gift.
