I like this movie / short story. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite part is the French song and in the opening title when the soldier spatula sells "OTHER!" I crack up every time. I would recommend this movie to Kloymation Knox fans, and those who enjoy Jason Steele's movies. His style of animation is very original. It takes a few opinions of the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also hilarious, and it's definitely not something you'd hear before. Like the Max Spatula distorted with a sound and light system in his head that colorful light and cheerful music every time he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch any time anywhere.
