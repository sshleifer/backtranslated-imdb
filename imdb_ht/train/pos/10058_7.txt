I admit that being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a child toddler heartwarming / guardian reluctantly. I've seen enough of them ?? Baby Boom, Kolya, about a boy, mostly Mat, and to some extent, whale rider ?? hoping to be bored by the formula. What kept my attention to the king of masks was stiff in the environment: China's small town in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the girls' children were considered worthless to poor parents being killed at birth or giving anyone who would take them to the black market. When Wang discovered the seed he had bought, whom he nicknamed "Doggie," is a daughter, she initially drafts it out, though she has shown great promise as a street-made legacy. Even after he reluctantly took it back, he was not too upset when he was kidnapped. The movie is bravest then, showing the lengths of a young, street-smart girl was to go to survive in this society. The lead two performances are credible and brutal in the context of society. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang to have not achieved more successful material. Wang is so well accepted his station as a celebrated artist and social status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie shows a level of prehistoric and cunning that might be suspected of a modern, suburban child, it's completely credible in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. After learning that his previous masters physically and mentally abducted him, his fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> Look at small town life in a foreign land, the natirelite of the two actors lead, twists are traced surprising, and of course, the happy joy all contributes to a very watchful movie.
