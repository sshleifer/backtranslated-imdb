Part of what was so great about the Cartoons Looney Tunes cartoons was irritated and how they did not fear doing anything they wanted. In this case, Marvin Martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling. Sure enough, it comes across Bugs Bunny, who warns of a mutiny on the part of Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally catches Bugs - by means of a summer acme-ejecting bazooka! - Bugs have more things to plan for the trip back to Mars. What I mean is, if you thought it was a big change in the solar system by stripping its planet's planet Pluto, then you saw nothing again! Yes, the "Hasty Rabbit" goes all out. How to buy acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean "rabbit" - is fun. And believe me, you definitely will. After all, a little space-out has never hurt anyone.
