This is a really old movie good fashion. The locations are great and the situation is one of these oldest preston movies sturgess. Girls want to watch a movie that does not require many other then they sit back and relax then this is it. The act is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was in Rounders, too. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. That's just what happens when two people on marriage meet one of them that they really love the weekend that they are planning their own wedding. I know ... sounds kooky ... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to look. It will make your girl friend either embrace you or leave you, but at least you will know.
