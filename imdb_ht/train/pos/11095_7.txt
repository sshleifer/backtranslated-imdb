I still loved this movie by Frankenheimer. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this was not just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His steady end and attention to little detail make all the difference, and even hire porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case by Roy Roy's latest movie. I always said Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III has received all the advertisements and her awesome performance and it's excellent but I really think Trebor has been standing out. Frankenheimer can not be proud of this movie as another but it is a full effective thriller of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porn actors appearing in partial scissors. What can you say about a movie with Ann Margaret being shot and drugs and rape? A fun culprit to say the least. Vanity has a very rugged surface and a young Kelly Preston makes an appearance early. A classic explosive thriller that should not be forgotten.
