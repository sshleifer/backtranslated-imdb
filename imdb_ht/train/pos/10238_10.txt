People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg steals a movie, and this film is no exception. Some movies I love hurt at the box office but I'm glad to say, this movie is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad for back then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not soft, and the music was modern, too, which is weird for an animated movie. I did not think Prof. Eye or his "Cirus Scary" was too scary for small children (the audience was aiming for this movie), but I thought what happened to the scary teacher in the end was a little too black for a child 'movie. In general, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I loved fondly for years.
