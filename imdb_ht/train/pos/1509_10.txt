The British horror film was in the decline of terminals by the start of the sixties, but from the shadow of the three film was among the best products. The Wickerman, without Satan's claws and the House that Dripped without making the future looks rosy, though a lot of people knew at that point would not be one. THTDB has the sort of cast that could easily form a list, if it has not actually been assembled, in the weakened hinterland in 2008 you may well find yourself hoping to wake up. Waxworks are most neglected in their four stories and, naturally, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can not tell where performance ends with start pain. One can only guess how this role affects a gentle, sensitive person. Death and maiden. RIP Peter.
