The Man Castle is set to one of these Jerry building colonies on empty grounds and parks during those times called 'Hoovervilles' named after our 31 unfortunate president who was stuck with the Great Depression who came to his administration. The proposal of this movie is that someone's house is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth to tell this guy even at good time would not work all that much. But in a very typical part of Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco, the start of a classic role killer, he played a tough, good characteristic of Loretta Young. Of these things about the Man's Castle is that it shows the depression effect on women as well as men. Women had some additional tension on them, if men had trouble finding jobs, women had it twice as difficult. And they were sexually harassed and some prostitutes just for a meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in facing these kind of issues and does not make any demands on him in his castle. Very soon if they are in love, though Tracy is not the kind to settle down. The favorite scenes had some extra zincs because Tracy and Young were having a tidal affair during the shooting of the Castle Man. And both were Catholic and married in those days that were a frivolous barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took faith in Catholicism quite seriously. <br /> Also at the disposal are Walter Connolly as a kind of dad dad for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau has been in all the Young incidents to meet and trying to direct it clearly with Arthur Hohl, a really sweet creep His eyes on Young too. Hohl brings the plot to the Castle Man in its largest in his complaining. <br /> <br /> The Man's Castle is look grimly at the Great Depression, not the usual film escapist movie for those trying to avoid what kind of reality in entertainment.
