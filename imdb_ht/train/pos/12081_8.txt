Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as the title character in this fun little nail-bitter fun. She accepted a position as secretary in a London corporation dowager (played impressed by Dame Me Witty) and her son clambering (the effect and harassed George Macready). Before he knew it, he got up to find himself in a seaside styling he never saw before, where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and towns nearby that she mad madaged. Of course, this fear can only plan dunning works, and even if we know that Julia has eventually escaped his trap, director Joseph Lewis is building real pendant in answering the question of just how he will manage it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> its-string and B-film pedigree. There is quite a moment that just can have you on the corner of your chair, and I find myself really rooting for Julia as he holds on to scheme ants and began to outsmart his capture. In any other gothic thrill, the heroine would have swooned, bursting and slowing, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing he had the heroine of this movie to use his brain and figure out how to save himself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> Class: B +
