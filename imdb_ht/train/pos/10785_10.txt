I saw that when I was little and was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and the wonderful Maycy mushrooms. Susan Bonde as Doodle with Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Prophet was interesting. Burl Ross as little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What Hiludus is Snoodle and Doodle Too Many Candy. The sad little Bunny Foo Foo riding the micky guys on the head then by a fairy will give little Bunny Foo foo some will then turn into goon. This story is about when Lisa Snoodle, Doodle goes to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. Show this is excellent kids will love this show, new words, songs, and watch to play.
