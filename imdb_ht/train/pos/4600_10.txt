This sad movie is this self should at least be in the top of 250 movies here. This is still the Best Action Movie ever done. The movie films of today are seriously making Actors and Action directors do not have any way to fight it with demonstration properly. Only few have no way to do it mainly in Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. Exhibitions are so intelligent and sticky I do not think we will see love at all times. Start where Chan and his team go down the car chasing the city's hill is just amazing. The fighting campaigns in the sequel is to fight the best stunt ever put in the movie. Cascades at the end slumping down the stalk crashed into Jackie's glass was very painful.
