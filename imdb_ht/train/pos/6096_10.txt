I know technically this is not the greatest television show ever, I mean he shot on video and its boundaries to show off both the audio and visual aspect of his. The acting case of time can also be a little crumby but I love this show many.it feared the hell from me when it first revealed in 1988.of course it would I was 5 years old.But I recently bought the DVD in the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear is now deleted.i I also hear the warner will not release any more due to the bad DVD's first DVD sales. The TV show did not even feel like the movies, in fact I thought it There was a much more sinister tone. Even if the color palette is similar to nightmares on street elm 4 (both movie and TV shows are made same year), this is more of a tone of gravity consider that the films were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing, i love freddy as the crap crap crap ker.but I think that was strenght of this TV show, you did not have freddy popping up every minuten utes cracking a joke before and after killing someone.in fact this has more of a dream to feel it, reinforced by The soft focus of the lens is not sure if its deliberate on the part of the creators shows or just the limitations of being shot on video. I love this show, and taken by as a companion piece of movies can be very enjoyable. Even better than anything on TV today.
