I watch a lot of movie, good, bad and indifferent; There is usually something in the interest set on, though it is only set design, or the reliable work of a good character actor, or the successful laugh from watching ineptitude captured forever. <br /> However, I was quite surprised to wonder this movie, one I never saw before. Graham Greene has translated many films of course, to the chiefs as "Thin Man" and in smaller cars. "Confidential Agent" is one of the smallest cars, but it managed to make me somewhere, despite the substandard direction, the pitfalls of Bacall and Boyer in response as (respectively) British and Spanish, and almost complete non-existence in any chemistry between the conduct. In some ways, the latest "problem" actually begins to work in favor of the movie, for how can they really love flowers in the murdered atmosphere of fascist and capitalist meetings on someone's tragedy? The most compelling feature of the film comes directly into complex psychology and guilty-related Greene, which prints the movie. I know some see the deliberate rhythm here as dull, and I can understand that. But I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was forced to look, not by any big act (although Boyer is beautiful as usual, managing to transmit a rich mix of world-trimes, tragedy, hopes, and scrubs with its magnificent voice and eyes of desire), but not Down-spiral rush into one's thin one's hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where only profit-making ends and OS starts? The film does not rise to the level of art, and thus can not be expected to answer those questions, but it is more than just entertainment, and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. Lack of glitz, in "bubble," in narrative "bounce" helps make this film very refreshing. There is no happy ending, for writing history ends.
