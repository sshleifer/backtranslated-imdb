I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and never forgot it. The film shows horror stories in a way that Hollywood usually gloss over. The relationship between the two warriors war is marked by differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we all really do not differ in the inside. If you can find any kind of copy this - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just awed.
