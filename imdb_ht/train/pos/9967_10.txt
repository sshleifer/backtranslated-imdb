There are some things I will never understand; why panties come in packs of threes when explicitly what is not enough is an example. Likewise, I will never understand this movie, and it's brilliant. If you approach this film awaiting an actual movie, you might as well approach Satan to await a hug; although this may be quite possible if you salute this satanic movie. Take pitch for example; The most effective, incredible, incredible painting of a demon since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten-sat Satan costume from the painted red body and cone covered with condoms. However, it creates some of the most hilarious moments in any movie ever. Seriously, this is no exaggeration. The same can be applied to all other characters, the girl's bar that acts so innocently it's probably overcompensating for some serious crimes at the party. Then again, if Santa's inter-space reconstruction station is real, there is no chance he could have avoided it long ago. Put simply, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious scrub. Characterizing achingly funny, acting, concept, and the almost-under-radar-radar make this a must see above any movie of the date (if you are after the most laughing).
