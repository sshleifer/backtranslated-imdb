While I'm not a big fan of musicals, I loved the films of Fred Astaire and the Rogers genera because they were just so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit formula, but even if you know what will happen, they are always very fun to look. However, despite that, I was a bit ashamed of this trip. Part of it was because this film has not been thrown in wonderful support as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL NOW DANCE. San Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be somewhat lacking - especially in the "fun" department. The funny antics of these actors supported gave the movie other films that you just do not get with the FOLLOW FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this one is more of a jerk - like head fat he becomes Rogers in trouble again and again. And, as a result, it's a lot harder like him or wants to see them get together at the end of the movie. Plus, although the music is not Irving Berlin, the songs just do not seem as memorable. In fact, none of the songs were all that special and I can not remember any of them though I just saw the movie. While this is still a beautiful and refreshing movie, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of the other films. Good but far from big.
