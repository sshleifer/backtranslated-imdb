Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedy genius, and this is Eddie's best of them. His material is very witty and hilarious, and his delivery is some of the best ever to witness on stage. Instead of insulting the hearing intelligence, it relies on her to draw humor from her wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the Moon, and the British landing. With very memorable laughs, one can not help but repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" They should consider one of the hollow lines ever delivered in a standing routine. Every fan of mind hazardous comedy needs to see the "dress to kill". By far the best British comedy I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage. However, its lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how very talented it really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, one that has found its way into video house, and can and should enjoy again and again.
