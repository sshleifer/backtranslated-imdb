I realize that this review will get me bashed by the movie critics to patrol this site, but I'll defend this movie. <br /> <br /> The dentist is actually a really good movie. The act is not always headache, but the good emotions and good stories. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobies. Not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great creepy dentist. It makes dentists what jaws do to shark ... they are. It obviously had a fairly limited budget, but it was well with him what they could, and developed the characters well (those counted).
