I was treated in a look at Bag Cracker last night before a screening of Disney's hole. I do not know who decided to show it but I am so happy to have done. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot in Australia in the early 80s as seen in a child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and his brothers were hilarious and, as with the rest of the movie, so true in life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my childhood (with the same age as the director probably helped a little) and the audio multiplied the feeling. I only hope I get to see Cracker Bag again a few days.
