I just watched the documentary "Mavericks City Fog" on Starz's cable TV network. It's without a doubt, one of my most enjoyable experiences I look ever! It's history in San Francisco Bay area artist and creative talent is responsible for some of the best films ever performed. In addition to the well-known artists listed, T also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment of Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD-this is a must for any collection of cinema and brilliant film-making stories. If you are the same adequately interested in movies and created people, you will not be disappointed.
