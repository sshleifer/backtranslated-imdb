Another fun, witty, girlfriend RKO music and Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW FLEET is a good movie. While it's missing out-of-the-minute tunes in SWNG TIME (although the final number "tune to the music and dance" is one of the best and equipment in the team), it is hugely enjoyable, as these could normally be Do not worry together in the 1930s. Again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is the absolute sky. These two aimed more romance and magic to dance than many couples in movies to make in a great love scene. While there are best Fred and Ginger music, this is certainly a must-see.
