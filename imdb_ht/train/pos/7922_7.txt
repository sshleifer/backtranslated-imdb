In this throwing-up of horror movie, 50 year-old cold paranoia of war, Reagan-era America, and high school film, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star star at Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) traveled to Communist Romania and while he was lost in the streets one night, it is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns stateside, he can not control his animalist incentive and goes on a murder case. Frustrating, he runs the city. Years later, Tony Immortal returned to the city and re-enrolled in high school. He still can not control his transformation, and the townspeople, and his friends, realize it is not quite human. It all culminates during the big football games schools. <br /> I hope this to be one of those 'bad ones in good' films from the early 80s. But I was surprised that the movie was actually, legitimately funny. Throw in, such as Kenneth Mars as a pervy trainer, Roz Kelly as lusty former Tony Blaze, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an oddball doctor, going all out, and hilarious outcomes. While watching this movie I was hit by how the writing looks and humor were 'Family Guy.' 'Full Moon High' has the same attitude and has never taken seriously.
