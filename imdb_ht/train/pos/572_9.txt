In response to those who commented on how the film jumped on and believed that there was no purpose in the role of Jess's brother here is my answer: <br /> The role of Jess's brother is to give a dramatic form of irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could predict the issues associated with life living in the whole not to look at how Jess's brother returned. There are several circumstances where Brad Pitt and his life run parallel, for example, when Jess's brother took Craig Sheffer into a disobedient bar and immediately found Brad Pitt a few days later. The dramatic irony was for Craig Sheffer's character to have a greater emotional turmoil in his brother's death, knowing he could do more to prevent it and immediately create a more compelling attitude in the movie.
