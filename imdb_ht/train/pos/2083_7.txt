This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of ​​many protagonists was progressive in and in itself. I found that the Chinese actors play Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then, there was not really any Asian actor in America (not even George Takei acted) and Rainer did a great job with his party. It was not the greatest performance I ever saw but for old-school pre-method act she was beautiful. The cricket scene was beautifully shot and convinced of special effects. I'm surprised that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turning this film into a allegory. Especially the political change has decomposed the peasant farmers and how they seem to be left behind at all. The film has some parallels in the style of John Ford, but I think the influence of Eastern affects it as well. If this was a western family, the crickets would have won in the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and taste. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.
