I finally got myself set up on DVD rental order order so I could get movie not available to me at the stores. I chose to oppose Souler because I love Christopher Meloni, and also loves little, often ignoring films. <br /> <br /> This one is like a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to pigeon his hole is you only ever see him as changing his name Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is an out of unattached middle-lifer stage who hit the skids in many ways, only finding a way to happiness in an unexpected person. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not about to do. I have not seen Busfield since 30something, and it was fun to look. But it's all Chris's movie. I became like a fan girl all over again .. It's a bit slow at the start I'm going to admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could be edited down. But in general, this movie will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest, refreshing view of today's relationship.
