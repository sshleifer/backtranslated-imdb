There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films ever to be not only in its genre, but also outdoors. I love the movie creepy movies like the whole it could happen here sort of Situation makes it frightening to think about. Also imagine if you were ever in this situation what you would do. This is a movie that I love watching very, especially around Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional I direct likes a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that it's best known film is Halloween.Oh's movie and if your thoughts on watching the kid's no radio radio. It's crap most and a True Halloween fans would like the 1978 John Carpenter version of the best. Myael Myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any movie, and it is a very well known one. So by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.
