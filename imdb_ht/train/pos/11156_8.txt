I typically do not like to show reality, particularly those profits off to the American Idol success. But this one I can live with. Comedians from all over the world make a brief routine of glamorous talent Scouts, and if they love them, these guys will send out a routine for a current audience. Then ten or twelve choose to live in a house together and make "surviving" style competition using funny tactics. Then one will be determined as "Last Funny Stand." I like to stand up comedy, so this is the reality of one thing to be stuck in my interest. There are usually some funny funny comics to choose from. He started his talent career as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May, and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that a lot of these comics were chosen for their contribution to reality show drama. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother," but now they did away with that, thank God. So, there are a lot of comedy I felt, they were only choosing not because they're funny, but because race, ethnicity, mood, sex, etc. when other comics clearly should be beaten out. But in general, it is a well-designed fact, which is two terms up until now I thought it was an oxymoron.
