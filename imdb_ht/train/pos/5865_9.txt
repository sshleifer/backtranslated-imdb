See this on cable back in the early 90's and love it. Never see it again until it has been shown on cable again recently. Always get it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why it's not much rated. I found everything about this compelling film. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situation brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this movie being more intensively now and our situation in Iraq. I hope this would be on offer more often for people to see. The human pay on our soldiers do not leave on the battlefield. He brought home for the rest of life. And this movie is one of the many that brings home in a very difficult way. Excellent movie.
