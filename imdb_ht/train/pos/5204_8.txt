I do not look much pornographic, but I like porn stars. And I like movies. So, when I heard about a star star porn star, I was really excited. Of course, that was years ago and when I heard about all the problem and done and finished the movie, I never thought I'd actually get to see it. But I did and I'm not ashamed to admit I loved it, even with all its flaws. <br /> <br /> First, the flaws. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story it seemed to mean is about the Sawn Beane family from Scotland. So why not just put it there and skip the third-class report on Samhain / Irish / Halloween immigrants? Also, it breaks their own rules by stating that you're safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start running ammo everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals we are dealing with. There's a huge stone castle that's obviously old, yet no one has noticed it before. The self-conscious films are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has a flashback mount of all his dead friends including a character he never met. The end does not make any sense. <br /> So what works? Gore a! Sure I would like more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that did not fear to be nothing more than a Gore film. The murders are on the head and Taylor Hayes has a stunned scene. Two wild murders even provide prolonged vaccine on the DVD. I've always been in the mind that Gore can overcome a stupid and wrongly corrected story of strengthening it.
