When the Grinch out I was excited if I thought she was going to make a happy go movie luck and she was. Even though he had a little nightmare before Christmas touched it. You know black and spooky types. I loved this movie because it helped to fill people with Christmas spirit. So mostly Grinch's save Christmas. And what happened then well in Whoville said that Grinch's little heart grew three sizes this day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
