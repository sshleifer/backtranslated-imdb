How nice to have a movie the whole family can look together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (married in real life) play a couple who are married in Las Vegas on a whim and then not just have to break the news of their kids, but then have to try to mele the house their respective (each has two boys and two girls) in a single family unit. What transpired when the group, including four adolescents, two preteens and two younger children, made one wonder at first if there could ever be happiness for Carrie and Jim. The fight between the children (and a little love affair between the two) makes one wonder if everyone can ever get together. More interesting than the Brady bunch, what this is a totally enjoyable way than a couple hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
