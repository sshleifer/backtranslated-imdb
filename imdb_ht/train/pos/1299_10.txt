I held a bit of this concert on public television and knew I had it. The boys give everyone in the Royal Albert an excellent, often typing performance completed in every way. Most, too - no synthetic, no smokehouse-shrouded and strobes, no adult appetite (and a harsh, hungry, and appreciated audience, everyone who left rockets at home). you are a fan of cream (or if you've heard only of them); if you are a blues fan; if you are a rock roll n 'fan; you will not be disappointed when you see and listen to this DVD. You also will never lose that DVD because you will never lend it to anybody. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Say to get their own!) It's too good and too replayable; you will want to keep it in easy reach.
