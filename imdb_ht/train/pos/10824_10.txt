"Still crazy" is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time-. It was untold compared to "This is Spinal Tape", which it has no relation to. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, quite frankly, not a very good, in spite of it's "outing" of many rocky stones). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care about people in "Still Crazy". It's all important. Oh, yeah, the very good damn music, too, written by Mick Jones at Aliens and Chris Difford in press. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy (Milieu, Actually, Pirates of Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Cinema).
