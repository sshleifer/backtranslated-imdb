I participated in a movieemaker's symposium, and showed this film after we had seen a movie so great and was involved in a 40 minute discussion. Even though it was extremely late and we were tired, the audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally I thought the movie was hilarious in all the right spots, and I loved the original cast of characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
