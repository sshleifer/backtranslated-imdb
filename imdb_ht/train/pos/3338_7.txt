Fever is a fun movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing show scene). Like most romantic comedy, she has a "dead zone" in the middle of all the heavy, "he broke with me" things happening, but other than it continues to be funny until the end. Even though the plot revolves around fans towards the Red Sox, it's not too busy with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Of course this is easy to say: I was a fan of Red Sox since I was a boy too. <Br /> <br /> 7 from 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
