Yes it's an artist ... successfully making a slow paced thriller. <br /> The story unfolds of beautiful merchants while you have not even noticed it passed. Robin Williams. The angles of the film may seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the basic scheme is highly engaging. The movie does not rush to you and you always flu just enough to keep you asking. The good direction. Using the lights to achieve wanting to affect in suspense and unexpected is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice 1 time to look if you are looking to put behind and hear a brief thrilling story!
