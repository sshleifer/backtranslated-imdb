Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-writing role. I liked exploding nuances, swinging in a long-lasting marriage - how many times do we find that in film, where usually the movie ends when boys and girls get together? This is an adult movie, a complex view of the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each fits adequately in the past and grow during the story. On top of that, she gave me 10 big stomachaches, and I'm one of those people who usually sit unamused when the rest of a hearing is laughing. This was one of the really funny movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
