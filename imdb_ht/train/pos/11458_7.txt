Greet again from the darkness. Insight in mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who must work ... does not matter the conditions, other things reason for life to stop. To see Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and to see its reaction to each of them is very much tossed. This artist creates because it must - not for money or fame. It is his life. When you see his failure, energy seems to be postponed from his body as a hot air balloon burst. He is not afraid at the beginning yet, it is that he takes his energy to work. Watching him create just to have control of nature and to remember his work is a bit painful but, however, breathtaking. It discusses the flow and time of the minimum dialogue and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one of the same. When he says he needs the ground, but he does not need it ... I implore them differently. Complaints only the music note seems to slow down a more relaxing speed.
