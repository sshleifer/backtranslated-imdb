Pick up the movie in the bug market for 4 bucks, make sure to get my money worth ... Care-less on the hot bees but the animation just blows me away after a steady diet of Simpsons (Sorry Mr. Groening) . The best part, facial expressions. Recommended multiple viewings and some cool tunes, good friends and a couple of cold people!
