There are several police dramas doing the judges. I do not know why. It's probably done with the old basic theme of good against evil. <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the hard novice of Anne, a raw recruit, in a police station squadron in the Baltic area. No attempt was made to glamorize the police. They are really down to earth, harsh and unhinderable, Anne on the other hand have a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all its rules sometimes hold back preliminary information found on its grounds research and other investigations. <br /> This is not a nice movie. No one to relax. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family break-ups, and children more distressed. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. <br /> As day goes by Anne becomes more intimate to participate in the police and families are investigating. The only real heat in the movie is that giving the character Benny, a 12 year old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of doing things patching. She looks like a blind eye to Benny's store and try to help her better she can. I was surprised though he went so far to Benny's father. He asked me to ask if he was considering the father or his own needs. After all, the movie made it clear that it was desperately needed by a partner with love kids. <br /> Well cast, but not my idea of ​​an evening entertainment,
