What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in it. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, apart from Ben Kingsley's performance, and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good singer. But Call Freedom has made my interest as some movies have in recent times. It is an interesting, fascinating film policy and great performance by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, a South African newspaper editor who befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a tough friendship, so Woods see Biko as a black black prepress against white. But Biko, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and complete transparency, wins on woods and introduces him to a reality about Apartheid that Woods did not know about. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizens who altruistically stand up against all prejudices and the system that keeps down its people. One night, from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. Authorities try to silence the issue because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But in Woods's efforts the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as Woods and his family become goals for the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. It was in fact of narration: first he tells life and death in Biko. It's an amazing first half, completely dominated by the charisma of Washington in what could be his biggest performance yet. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, tells Woods to try out to escape from South Africa to publish a book on Biko. Woods became an enemy in the state, someone prohibited, meaning he can not meet people or leave his country. Plus it was still visited by the police. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in the second half of this as well. Although the first half is quite straightforward, the second interesting and corrective things, do not give the resumption of Biko and the events that show the repression against South African nuns. Some may argue this is to make it more interesting, but for my second half just as fascinating, like Woods and his family elaborate a bold plan to save South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minutes were so heartbreaking I was in tears. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's notes certainly had something to do with it. Although I've never been much of a fan of Fenton (can not stand his Gandhi score), I think the score for Liberty Call is one of the most beautiful ever composed of movies. The film, thanks to the music marries the powerful images, at times incredible in emotions. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be taken care of in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis of creating a song for the human spirit of the human being. This film deserves somewhere along with movies like the pianist, the life is beautiful and redemption of Shawshank.
