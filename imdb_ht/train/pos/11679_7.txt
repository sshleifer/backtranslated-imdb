Clara Bowie's beauty and beautiful appeals are the main reasons for watching this movie. "Hula" is not quite up to date with Clara's best film but it is always enjoyable. He dances, it's sluggish horse, he pursues the man he loves. This movie is just about an hour long and led by the future Oscar winner victory fleming (go with the wind). The movie quickly moves and clara bows has plenty of screen time. If you like clara, I would recomomend "hula."
