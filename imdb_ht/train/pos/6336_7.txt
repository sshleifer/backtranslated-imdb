OK, so FXs are not high-budgeted. But this story is based on true events. Not something thrown together to make a couple of actors rich, even richer! As most movies based on books, some things just do not fit. Only a couple of people claimed that this movie was based on real events, not a hit-off as most people believe it is !!

Other than both movies are on tornado. <br /> For those of you who have problems with science in the tornado and storm in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember ... the actual "night of twists" was June 3, 1980. So This film released 16 years after the real events. Try to think how far advanced search storms are at that time. He arrived in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Though the movie calls the city something else, and tells it in a small town.
