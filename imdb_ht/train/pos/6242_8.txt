I agree with the previous commentary on the content of the movie "Daily Madness", but would like to specify that: "Dog Day" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. The following episodes we see here show some variations in daily discrimination in women, especially categories by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act as his late wife has been treated like a doll that will act "worthy to wear" the old dress. There is a couple of middle ages in which her relationship is almost a slave and her (violent) master. Further we find a bit younger who does not communicate with his / her friends and instead of being truly jealous about matters he even makes friends with his competitor (s). An adult young man makes clear to his friends - a girl who is really troubled by being very enough for her - that she had the jewelry in her side and followed her narrow stiffness to see her in labels. Finally there is a man in his fifty circles who calculate his own advantage to deliver a shady-looking woman to an angry customer who - taking it for guilty because he has scratch his car - natural beat it up. To fill the examples we find the pals in the man of the "master-slave" -the couple - after collective abusing its ominous and outraging the former "in its" for it will get rid of his partner and persuade himself as its new "master". During all of this, people living in the neighborhood built recently that the action takes place resting under the summer sunburn - absolutely immobility (SIC!). Unfortunately I have not seen the last few minutes of this shocking and authentic show of the reaction structures that are still reigning in the relationship between women and men, but I have seen convincingly analyze the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool in teaching even the less sensible scenery that goes wrong - due to good visualization.
