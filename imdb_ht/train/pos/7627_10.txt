I remember watching this movie a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles of Graceland, it all came back flood. Why did not a video or DVD release again? It is this sacrileguous Majesty of making films has never been released while other garbage was. In fact this is one movie of John Carpenter who has not been released. In fact I have not seen it on the TV either since the day I watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for Elvis's role. This is definitely a role it was designed to play. As the rest of the carpenter's horror brought this I would like the TV to play again. It is well-done and well done as far as the song goes. Belting out most of Elvis's greatest hits and gusto. I think this was also the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter who made them go on making a number of great movies (escaped from New York, Things, Big Issues in Little China, and escaped from In LA Someone came to release this before someone made a remake or their own version of his life, which I feel would not only save the king, but also the magic of the one who has this one. Do not get released then we will be at Heartbreak Hotel.
