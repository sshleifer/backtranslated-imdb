Interesting, fast-paced and fun. <br /> I'm not one of those who watch loads and loads on TV. I stumbled on this show while home sick and a bad case of influenza one day, and was immediately hooked. I developed a great break on John Burke. Both he and Claire did an amazing job at hosting the show together. You can really say that they both loved their work. <br /> <br /> The super-collector segments were excellent. I found myself interested in things I had never previously given. <br /> What would I really like to know is: Whichever happened to Jack the dog? Is one of the hosts adopting it?
