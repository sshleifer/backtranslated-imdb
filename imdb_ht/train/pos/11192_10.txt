I have been doing this film several times here in college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me will grow exponential ... in addition to the girls, anyone I've already shown to it need to see it again! It takes a little time to get into it, but at the end of the whole room is screaming, crying, crying, repeating repeating scenes, repeating dialogue, and just totally and completely hauling in the manure experiment that is Pia Zadora of the "Lady Lonely"! Scenes after the most uninformed scenes after the scenes, Wrongly Wrath, Thoroughly Actually Trash throw you into an all-out attack that hangs as the canyon thing I own (no little statement, friend). For I have nothing to compare 2 U, Pia ... and I do not think I'm the only one who has ever felt this way!
