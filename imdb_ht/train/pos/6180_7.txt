During the night opening of the Vanties a woman was found dead on the catwalk above the stage. As the show continues the police attempt attempts to kill the people and why before the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so I was excited to find myself a copy. Unfortunately no one has told me about the music numbers that go over and over and over. While the numbers certainly are the type that Hollywood has done on their glory day, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite trying to tackle action around them. This would not be so bad if the music was half decent way, but it's not. There is only one good song. Its worst as if the studio knew they had one song, Cocktails for two, and we are forced to endure the four versions of it: a duet, a huge production number, like the vanities final and in the background as music assistance. I do not think Spike Jones and Slickers City have ever played it so much. The rest of the movie is very good and Victor McLaglen boxing nicely with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny is his scene as an actor in love with the wardrobe's mistress. <br /> There is no means to say I can recommend this if you think you can get in the music numbers, or want to scan through them. It's a fun movie of the sort they do not do any more.
