The "Days" are a family drama and a little catch - you must relate to the character 's emotion in every possible way in order for you to really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possibly Spoilers for those who do not have friends with the show] The story, obviously, for everyone who watched the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He recorded his days with his family and hoped to become a rich and popular writer one day because of his observations. Her family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister, and a small-tech brother. The first episode, which will sound a bit stupid since Jan Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and the mother get pregnant. That's the first situation the writer hits. Then the father left his job at the law firm. The youngest son becomes a panic attack. Children are getting into a fight with the sister companion. This is all at work a day. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a little little but I love it. First I thought the camera-work was a ripple but then I used it and started to love it. I loved the quiet conversations under a dark light. I liked the intimate feel of the show. I love the low-budget style. I liked the act. I admire the story. Then I found I want a second season. I slowly became a fan of it as the Episode 6-Episode about ABC came to an end. It's a really good show and it's nothing like the OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> But if you can relate to either Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll love this show. Many.
