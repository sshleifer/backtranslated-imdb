This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moving along brilliantly by intense images that deeply moves the tender sensitive. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children looking for revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting in their world a version of what they witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has been forced on each of them. One is a sexually reprimanded patient patient. Another person is a hustler who gets sick. The third child, a young lady, came a little bit and served in the sanatorium. This film is an allegation of the psyche's violence. <br /> This movie has a climax that definitely does not for members to squeamish at the audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The act is excellent with the script well written. There is a music note that gives an undercurrent to scary all this movie. This is not a movie for thrill seeker but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
