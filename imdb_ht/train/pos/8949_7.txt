Vertigo co-star Stewart (in his latest turn as a romantic lead) and Novak elevated this, other Stewart's other "movie Christmas," the movie above entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and revelations further gleaned out of the movie if magic is seen as a metaphor for private pain that affects many relationships. All in all, a beautiful rehab and legendary stars, 7/10.
