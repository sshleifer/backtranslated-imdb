I gave this movie 8 out of 10, 10 for my Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog millionaire more recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge on such films without understanding Balkan life, mentality and a soul that Kusturica presents mastery. To understand it you really need to be one of the Balkans. This is an amazing, better and more contemporary movie in his previous movie, which is boring at this time, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I love humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. Draws is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it now, but remember reading my daughter-to-sleep reading a similar story.
