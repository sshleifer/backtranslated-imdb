David Duchovney created a role that he replied a bit of Californication - the troubled talent. And it is a role it plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and brings you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain with Angelina Jolie powder. The story of a shame doctor finds his way into a criminal world well scripted. Drug addiction and a desire for Jolie to mix blend a licensed cocktail. Unfortunately towards the end of the story gets a little weaker and the relationship between bandits and the FBI is wounded and run as if it created only to develop the final stage. But aside, a movie worth seeing.
