This film is one of the most risky black and white films at that time in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Code was applied. It's the story of a beautiful young woman moving to New York and making his way to the top of the business using his body as a get-togethers. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays young and beautiful Lily powers who really do a fairly good job and performances. Lily is moving to New York and makes her way up where the business does not sleep with all the guys. Stanwyck performs an exceptional performance by being a strong woman who uses men as an air deal, hardly any emotion in the direction of playing as if they were pawns. Power Lily is a woman who does not like her ideas just power and money. I think this movie must be somewhat different then my other movie was seen because there is hardly any background music heard. I believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the movie. Sometimes the music is heard at the beginning as it shows how it's moving up the chain. The movie with different scenes was something fantastic! The director of this movie has made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was all along a movie Well. That film was not as good as it should, but it did not totally ruin it. Baby face has its slow scene moving around the movie, and maybe a few predictable parts like who it will sleep and next. But this is an adorable movie that can look more then once, and suggests to some people and friends.
