Good for entertainment tonight - but the draw was compelling. Garrison's affairs with the First Lady were real and passionate; The president was a cut-out box. And who was the real villain anyway? Nothing has been developed or explained sufficiently. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole was involved. Bananas were nameless and unfamiliar, so you never felt involved in the drawings. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some facts into the story - the chase and the confrontations were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their role, Basinger totally character character and no way could be Longoria was a secret service agent. This could be a very good movie but somehow he missed the way, with too many questions unanswered. Irritating to the whole despite very good performances. Did they use the 'West Wing' for the white scene? - I was expecting CJ or Charlie to appear!
