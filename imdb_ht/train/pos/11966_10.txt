This is an excellent set. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares about each other and helps each other in crisis have a good example of how we should live our lives. There are so many good things to do, and a number of bad choices, but they never go back to family, they work in trouble. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from Childhood Syndrome and the help of all family members is best. DJ, the oldest daughter, is growing whether her dad wants it to happen or not. One thing to share is to miss their mothers. Danny (Dad), Joey, and Uncle Jesse love so many children, and it's apparent in each episode.
