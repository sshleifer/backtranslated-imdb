Second Care Bears Movie is incredibly better than its predecessor. It has a deeper, better character development, and tunes (especially the closed song) are both enticing and warm-hearted. Make sure the movie tends to care for caring hands but it's a movie bears movie. This movie is a great picture of children's shows because it emphasizes friendship, love, and yet, cares. Not to mention Care Bears are just too adorable!
