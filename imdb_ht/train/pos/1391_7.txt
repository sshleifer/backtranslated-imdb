Considering being made on a low budget, the DAY TAG ends to manage to make the most of its budget and some amazing effects of special effects. The story involves a family on to go to the solar -Powered houses in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed - by motorcycle hordes, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, humanoid humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light from a trillion star blast has caused extreme aurora to show up in the desert heaven. So the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, found themselves face-to-face with alien force aliens who were placed in a time-and-space chain. <br /> <br /> Mix in component in 2001: A SPECIAL EDUCATION AND INFORMATION IN THE TREATMENT, CHILDREN HOPE, despite its obvious deformities and uneven acting, remain interesting due to the special effects of David Allen's special effects. The desert environment is very suitable for this film's closing encounters; and while the film can not really be compared to the movie Kubrick or Spielberg, DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS hit-compromises. I give credits to Jan Bud 'director Budo, whose 1977 comedy KINGDOM of the spiders has been made for an exciting predecessor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, for at least trying - and on that basis, I give the time to ENDED a 7 out of 10 .
