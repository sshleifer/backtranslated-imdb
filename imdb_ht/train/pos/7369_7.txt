Personally I could not go into 'This is not a Love Song', it's a brilliant movie and there's a big story line it, I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much left in the movie. <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, having that close they depend on each other to get together in their lives. At the same time I wish the relationship was much more than it is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Ibsen't Spike in love with Heaton, or she does not know how to love her. The acts of betrayal, on both sides, have a great effect on the men. They are both devastated by the fact that the other runs and abandons them, at a time when they really need each other to survive.
