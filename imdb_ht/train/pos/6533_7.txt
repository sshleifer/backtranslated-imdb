I must say that this was not very interesting, but talk about how fashion and strange way to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... that's fantastic! I really like this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flit) is quite pretty hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he would must have been more upset with her for how she treated her ... Well, this movie is the journey and fashion of disguise. Whatever, I recommend this movie, just for fun summer. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen spy cinema by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? It was good at this difficult detective work.
