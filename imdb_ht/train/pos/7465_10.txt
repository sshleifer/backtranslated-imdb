Warning: Is there any crowd? <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> If you have not seen this movie and plan on doing this, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You must see this movie. I saw it four times so far and I still did not mind me about what exactly happened in the movie. This is all I'm going to say because if you have not seen this movie, then stop reading now. <br /> <br /> If you still read reading then I will ask some questions for you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can send me an email and let me know what you think. <br /> I remember my 11th grade English professor very well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years, and he always had that way to teach you things that maybe you were not all over. If we did not like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance and modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room has never been a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book in our own entertainment time. This was our own inelible way of branding something in our sponge spirit like. I start this review of Vanilla Sky with a brilliant man's description because he once gave us a placement that was firmly in my mind, as the phone number of a longer lost friend, and he finally made some sense to me after watching the womb. Now, if I did not know better, I would think that the brothers Wachowski was really just an alias for my teacher Krisak. But given the benefit of the doubt, we will assume he did not read it. But that was the first time this placement was nothing more than impalpable. <br /> She asked us to prove it to ourselves that was real. Show me how you can say that you are real. This got the spouting class off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything comes from pain, in the sense of touching sense of the loss of hunger they have pulled away from our teachers to prove to him that we were real. After each scenario we gave it, it would return with the one answer that would leave you speechless. <br /> "What if you do not have anything but someone else's dream?" What if you dream of someone else? What a messed question is. This was a question / storyline asking us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the internet and quick progress of computer. How is it possible to look like this? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it was you were part of another's dream. <br /> Another brilliant film, but this year's movies, David Mulch Mulholland Drive explores similar areas. But vanilla skies goes deeper than any other movie can hope. In short this film is one that will literally (if you leave it) blow yourself in all the possibilities surrounding you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, upright, full of self publishers and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talented and savvy business, his board of governors, the seven necks, think he is a rich dink made of a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he does nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie we encounter one of David's gorgeous games named Julie Gianni, played with pèrfish but Sonic Perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they just have to use each other and not the slightest bit of interest in a monogamous, committed commitment. This is the kind of relationship that corresponds to David's other flings he had in the first sexual life of his life. And although speaking a good game, we can say that only one is really telling the truth. <br /> <br /> Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a string of genius by Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that David will publish but also their good friends. This is something that David has very little in his life, and you can feel a real caring for each other early in the movie. Brian has a famous line that she keeps telling David about and over again. And that is "the sweetness is not so sweet without the bitter". She goes to tell her that one day she will find true love and not just this lover party situation that she seems to commit to all the floors that reside her bed for a night or two. In David's great birthday bach, (so great that the love of Steven Spielberg wants him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played by course by Penelope Cruz and what has to be pure good performance this year by an actress. This is a bush not only invited and the first David and Sofia seem intrigued with each other. And in typical David fashion, although his best friend was there, he started flirting with Sofia. For complicated things, Julie shows up uninvited and starts spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw karikote to each other. There are no Hanky ​​pants. The next day, as David left Sofia's apartment, he was welcomed by Julie, who offered him a ride and out of the ....... well, I think we've seen all the ads. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the movie teases us with what reality and what disturbing perceptions. We present to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play part of this maze like mists. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like healing-anyone who can or can not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing options the movie offers, but it does not end there. <br /> Like many cinemas seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. Sixth Sense can have started this craze, but look even further back, and you can perhaps thank Angel hearts to begin the craze. Regardless of how it came from, Vanilla Sky has one of its own in self-extract busters. And what makes this one great fun is that the movie gives you many obvious clues along the way, but not enough to give you an Apodictic Gauntlet solution of truth and lies you just put yourself in. I saw this film four times and every time it was because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand. To work yourself in the theater, allowing it to open up to new possibilities is very rare in a movie. All of the so-called ersatz called "Best Pictures of the Year" were good, but nothing spectacular. They miss substance. A nice idea was intriguing but flat, the Royal Tenenbaums were interesting, but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a movie that leaves you desire to further guarantee your satisfaction because the movie and those who have taken care of it. I know this movie got mixed reviews but I just think that those who do not like it do not quite understand it. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that should be like. This is what a movie should do to you. It should make you feel something. Most of the other film this year were just empty spaces. This is not. <br /> 10 out of the 10 best film of the year. I would like to see this get nominated for the best photos and I would like to see Cruz up for Best Comedy, Diaz for Best Support, Cruise for Best Actress and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for the best actors to support. Cameron Crowe should have as well. None of this can happen, and that's a shame. This is one movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And on a final note, I'm sure Mr Krisak would like this movie and maybe this is the one movie that can answer his questions. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figure of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted to another person's ambition? This is a movie that spawns more questions than it answers. And I'm sure it's just fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
