Frustrated Deputy District Interim George Maxwell (a good performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this picture) can not stand his naggy, Frigid Woman Edith (a bitchy Anne Bellamy) again. Worse yet, poor George is further sealed with a newborn baby sun and a lesbian lesbian teen (brunette escort Sheri Jackson). George has an adult and beautiful, enticing, and free-dynamic fling swinging Hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (delightful to play with sexy panties by appetizing blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). The compliments occur when George finds himself being blackmailed by Julia Freeman's (a nicely swinging turn by Kathy Williams), who wants George to spring his composite biker robot Laurence Mackey (a pair of Tessier Robert, who is sports a head full of hair here) out of prison. Director Tom Laughlin (Yep, the same dude who described Billy Jack!) And James McLarty's scriptwriter ensures the story stringent with a winning and entertaining support of tasty nudity girls, sizzling soft-core gender, and raw violence. In addition, they accurately peak all wild'n'easy uninhibited sensitivity to the 60-year-old culture and relate to the plot in a tight 75 minute run time, thereby ensuring that this film does not overstay its welcome. A definite record occurs when candy invites his groovy friends on the home of Maxwell for a smash basement stream filled with smoker skin, plain rock music, and, of course, hot nude chic dancing. The overthrow notes Robert O. Ragland hit the spot gnarly. Stanton Fox's high-tech and white cinematography adds an extraordinary edge to deliriously silly go-on. Best of all, this flicker movie as a wonderful showcase for Patricia Wymer is spacious and cool-faced, which positively lights up the screen with her sweetness, petal personality and fascinating beauty. A total Trishy treats.
