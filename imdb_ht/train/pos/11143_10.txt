Watch this as a young naive punk when he first released. There was my sniffflin 'like a baby as I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again now at '07, I knew what to expect & sobs were ready & prime as the required time was approaching. Fortunately this time I was at home. <br /> What I did not remember in my youthful look - or maybe not been noted because of her, was the brilliant technique of this movie. The use of flashbacks that tells many stories without resorting to dialogue. The camera work seemed to put the viewer, along with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street in the diner, the boiler pan behind the woman & kids sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> The story itself, & the characters - butcher, sad & real brutal. It is very touchy to be drawn so close to a human drama like this and most of us would likely spread. Then again, Joe & Ratso might be any of us. You must have been '70 when I saw it. I remember that on leaving the theater I was motivated to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a big movie.
