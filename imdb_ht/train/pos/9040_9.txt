A good true American story about adolescents interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal neighborhood, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. <br /> <br /> Through tribulation, tribulation and persistence beyond beliefs are finally able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. As her science motivation teacher, Laura Linney is good but accentuate her south is on top. There is an exceptional performance support by Chris Cooper, a top miner, who wants his son to follow in his track, but gradually comes around the movie end. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so strange for our time is that there is no bed-jump scene and no profanity too. It is an episode of an American-made history. In addition to science, we have the father-child disagreement, football scholarship as a way to save coal mines, and the love of the family. <br /> <br /> Why are not photos like this recognized more at premium times?
