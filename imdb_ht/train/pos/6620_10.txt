If this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. I just saw it a couple of hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the movie takes place) and I can still feel the great shock I got in the back of my eyes ... What a visual shock ! I have never seen such a beautiful black & white pictures and such a radical change in the way of doing anime movies. I strongly believe in having a before and after "Renaissance", as well as what we saw with Pixar movies or the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of anime cinema and I hope this French initiative (a French gym studio and a few genres that have a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will be successful and the recognition he deserves. Live in France!
