So, did this movie film score only a 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without this 1984 version of Dickens' classic story is the best ever to do. And yes, the Hound saw the 1951 version that was good, but not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest failure in this version, although the act was wonderful. George C. Scott is simply incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this silly businessman who is haunted by ghosts of his dead partner, then by three other minds later on evening. Scott is well spread as Scrooge. Too many in fact for some critics claiming that it's impossible to project the new Glee-got it up on Christmas morning after the demons teach him an important lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never go downstairs to the street to a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and Scrooge reads his emotions in a realistic way. The performance supports are just as excellent, as are the costumes, music, and scenery. 19th-century London comes to life in Clive Donner's style of visionary. The same film borders on pairs of several scenes involving demons. The important story of brightness in every frame, though. <br /> You will not often find this version revealed on TV again, and that's a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should have a part of every celebration of the house on the holiday. When decorating them out of the basement, this movie should find its way to the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 stars.
