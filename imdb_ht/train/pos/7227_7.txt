Peter O'Toole is a treat to look at the role where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to wake in stupor over. Susannah's beautiful York gives a good look for O'Toole's dramatic presence. The hint of hint movie - without a single explicit scene - but it is able to entertain the viewer of its social rocket. Even if this is not great movie by any rules, it will be remembered for its fun performances. Even York, signing the papers in the end, is a treat to look, exuding silent tragedy. The weakness here is to put back Thompson. But the movie floats because of the actors and the script. <br /> I saw the movie twice over a period of 20 years - on both occasions and the name "Love Feeler". "Country Dance" is a rather frank and appropriate title for this film, regardless of where it was released as such.
