For a first movie in a series of propositions he achieved the right balance. It does with style and class showing Modesty's early days as a refugee and starting to rise to power in the criminal world. I think it's a very honest / true portrayal of her character exactly as writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful with an excellent choice. It acts very convincingly as a hard-working survivor and an exterior of cool / intelligent / innocent. With full scores of Tarantino to choose an unknown actress for the role - much more to believe in having a new face creates the part. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
