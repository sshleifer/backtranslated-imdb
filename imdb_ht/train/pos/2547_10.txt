One does not get to enjoy this gem, 1936 invisible Ray, often. But no one can forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, stiff and indebted to his Carpathian mountain retreat, is Janos Rukh, his engineering science that he has the ancient beams of light in events accountant of the great geological tragedy that is particularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteorite in Africa. Join him is ever-elegant Lugosi (like a rare hero), who studied "Astro-Chemistry." Frances Drake is the beautiful young wife; Frank Lawton's romantic temptation; and Violet Kemble Cooper's wine is Rukh's mother, in a worthy performance for Maria Ospenskya. The story moves rapidly into bold episodes, and special effects are always nice. It also has some wonderful lines. A Rukh restored to his mother and asked, "Mom, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever, and what I see my fear." Even better when Mom Rukh said, "He broke the first law of science." I am not alone among my friends who have been rogue for many years exactly what this first science law. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely desert island islands.
