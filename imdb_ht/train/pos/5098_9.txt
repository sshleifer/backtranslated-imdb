Even Shirley fans can be surprised for "NOW and Forever". The movie was filmed and Paramount Studio ?? by Shirley's parent company Twentieth Century Fox ?? In 1934, before Fox producer Darryl Zanuck was the perfect Cyril Shirley formula (beautiful songs, cold hearts to melt, young couples to play cupid, happy fins). So, "Now and Forever" falls into the category of a Shirley car without the standard Shirley story. It's an awkward position for any movie, but this is impressive, throwing talent to make it work. <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as fun-loving, irresponsible artist Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing that this devoted dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart. When they suddenly landed with guards at Jerry Penny's girl (Shirley Temple), she's Toni ?? and not Penny, as many believe? who convinced Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry flounders in his office work, and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family, he soon returns to slingshot and dishonest. In a standard Shirley device, Penny is trying to dissolve the heart of curmudgeon curmudgeon Felix Evans, the victim of one of Jerry's inconveniences, but his attempt failed, Evans is revealed to be an artist himself, and Jerry's blackmails help he steals jewelry. Drama, gunfight, death, and sorrow that follow all this very unusual movie for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dancing, and only one sequence of songs (the lovely number "The World Makes Me a Living"). But this does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever." Instead, it's divergence from the usual Shirley story to make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films. But be careful: You should avoid coloring the movie version, and see it in black-and-white if you can. The color is bright, garish, and unrealistic, and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde. Yikes!
