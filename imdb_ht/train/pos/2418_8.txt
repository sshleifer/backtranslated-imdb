One of John Funniest's, Eugene Levy is great in this one too, Just wanting the studio to know that this one needs to be on DVD, I have it on video tapes, but feel that this movie deserves DVD ( and extras would be great) Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) skit is so funny, as the movie is full, also the scenes he had with his girlfriend and his family are great, this movie never looks to be on TV, but it loses most of hilarity when edited for TV broadcast, if you can find the video I would suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy) I'll keep my VHS until one days we get to see it on DVD. There are many great movies out there that have not yet been released in DVD, and this is one of them.
