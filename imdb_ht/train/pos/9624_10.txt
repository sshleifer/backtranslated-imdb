The movie I thought it was excellent he thought to be about romance and a little suspense in between. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I do not know why people keep giving him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris it is a great actress and for those who think it looks too old for Rob it's only five years. Rob had a lead role in his own TV series as well as one on the Broadcast Channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka sweat knife and PainKiller Jane. He also starred in a number of television cinema and now has a mini TV set. Need to give him the more leadership role that is best in.
