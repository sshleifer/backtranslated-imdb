Put simply, this movie is terrifying. <br /> It starts simply, looking like a study of a rebellious young man and going on to become a very well-crafted film film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore, or zombie. This is psychological, and as it would also do in Candyman, Bernard Rose managed to convey the horrors that were not believed. <br /> <br /> Each time you watch this movie, you realize more about what's happening, and about how the two worlds in this movie are interconnected. <br /> <br /> Drawing has never been scarier.
