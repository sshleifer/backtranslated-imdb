The material of this documentary is so powerful that it leads me to tears. Yes, I say water. This popular struggle in a traditionally exploited population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights, expel the best in the community and stop making excuses for not challenging the facility. Chavez represents weak and unfortunate in the same way Bush is facing dirty corporations and capitalist running amok. Indeed, Latin America has been reshaped with the majority of marginalized ultimately having a voice of more than five centuries. Though, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He tries to change the constitution to allow him to rule indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the movie; The speed is breath taking at the time, and deeply philosophical of others. He presented Chavez as a hero of the unafraid US Hegemony's challenge and domination of the world's resources. If you think the author is favored in favor of Chavez, there is nothing left to you from doing your homework. A critical message from the film is questioning sources of information, as clearly demonstrated by the stealthy accidents that were shamefully blamed on Chavez's supporters. Venezuelans put US democracy allegedly for shame. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
