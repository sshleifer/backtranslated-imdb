Alain Resnais cinematographer likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. In this film too we see members of Resnais' family like Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, Andr√© Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious terms such as death, religion , suicide, love and the general implications of our daily lives. Formal nature of relationships shared by these obvious people as friends, are addressed to one another using your formal form.In 1984, while making L'amour dead end, Resnais faced with time, memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a movie a bit the same as Watching Eyes Watches that were also about love and memories.Message in this movie is loud and clear: true and great Deep Love can even put shame science as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving the doctor for reputation care.L'amour dead is like a game that is not at all pedagogical. It's a movie in which the music note is in tandem perfect with its image. This is one of the reasons why this movie can be easily solved.
