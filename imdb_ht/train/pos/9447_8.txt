Engrossing the drama of four people over a weekend canoing down a remote river. They are pioneers Ed (Jon Voight), adventurer, Lewis violin (Burt Reynolds), obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and cute guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first minutes of 40 are great - there's the incredible sequel to the banjos, interestingly interesting among the characters and just stunning cinematic scenography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then the hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them is Bobby Rape ... and the trip becomes a nightmare. <br /> Just incredible. The scenery is incredibly beautiful again this horrible violence taking place. To be authentic, the Beatty violation never bothered me - I'm very aware that it was false despite the good act. This movie also shows how the characters change - Ed has pessimistically tested, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is raped by one of the people he mocks earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely. <br /> <br /> The act is especially good. Voight is just OK in the lead - it was better. Beatty is also just OK - but it's his first movie, and he has to bow down as a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things begin to fall apart. And Reynolds is just superb - one of her best works to act ever! How this was not even nominated for a Night Academy Award. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too credible as the hillbillies. <br /> A powerful movie - PA for kids. Try to see an uncut version - the TV version is darkened. Also look at milk-box is essential to capture the enchanting images.
