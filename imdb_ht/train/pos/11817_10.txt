I saw Dick Tracy when I was young. I did not know that any of the actors were, and I did not know the movie would turn out different than it was preview. I'm sure he likes though. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty star as the crime-detective fighting 1930's Dick Tracy who goes after the largest mob bosses in the city. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and is from taking over the city and his singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) whose eyes are on Tracy. It gets even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no figure. He or she is very unknown. More, the famous villies are back from the comic book collection. <br /> I think this movie was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to look especially like a child. Warren Beaty was just like James Bond in 1930 in the way he played Dick Tracy. A cast cast of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus More! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
