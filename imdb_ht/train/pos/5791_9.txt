This happened to be one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, especially for the painting of two soul soul in a post-apocalyptic setting. <br /> <br /> The cobweb-strewn shops and debris-Laden streets are unusual in what particular ways the Twilight Zone does best. While the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by today's drama standards, it is an excellent one - using the environment to make a statement related to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is timeless. All the dramas rest only on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (Let's both rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
