Seeing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable films are like a rarity, when one comes along like "impulse", it is something to embrace. The script is logical, and very creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn, and Bill Paxton, giving credible performance. This could be played out as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any boring "zonbifist", and the brightness of originality in almost every scene. You get the feeling that something like this could actually happen, even if the script is the best fiction. From the "Grabber" opening until rolling credits, you'll be captivating. Very fun and definitely recommend. - MERK
