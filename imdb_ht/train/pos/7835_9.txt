I saw this film last night in a special theater movie that showed in Nuremberg, and it was superb. I have to admit that the original music composition of the violin player and percussion / Xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also has the strength of its painting in the tragic legend Nibelungen. If you are interested in silent films or in the Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the act was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of "film silent tragedy") Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this film duet that Siegfried worries. The story of this second movie begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norse version of the story) begins planning his revenge against his brother. <br /> <br /> Also, I watched this movie in German; I am an English native speaker and have a basic German knowledge. It was difficult to read the "subtitles" (what do you call that in silent movie?) At first because of the old German script style, so I advise that if you look it in German that you sure can contrast the "," F ", and" that "in the old script. :)
