Pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (winner of Oscar technical special techniques) is true enchanting. Add an endless variety of celebrity costumes with a romantic dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you've got a "nice picture" rather bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the conspiracy understands as well as on-blow acting leaving much to be desired. Still, there was no more enchanting Technicolor movie before that one (1936), and very few since then, that can be the top of this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Cinema fans who enjoy the glorious cinema of "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. "The Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color movies.
