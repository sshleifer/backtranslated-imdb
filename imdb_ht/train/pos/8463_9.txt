Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the fourth series in the Gundam stories to continue. Unlike previous entries focusing on massive warfare, this one is slightly different; instead of having a host-vs-host situation, this one is led by five young boys (due to their ability to mix more easily than normal adults) and cars called "Gundams" because of the metal alloy used in construction. That's the problem, since gundams are supposed to be destroyed, replaced by "Mobile Suits", which are piloting less destructive weapon platforms and "dolls" that run on A.I. and used as infantry grunt. The whole point in the series is a metaphysical question that gives Gundam wings a corner about a larger portion of the Anime that makes it the way here. Especially since most animated fits in popular magazines, such as Naruto, DragonBall, One Piece, Dragonball Z and InuYasha which all come from Shonen Ale, which is now available in America. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam Wing sets itself apart from most animated in the fact that instead of over-the-top battle between mortar that is more like the gods, Gundam is something that is humanist and looks like revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic events and looks like they unfold through the graceful series. Normally in anime there are more than some series that think that the best way to go about having a "small" battle is to have it take half an hour - something that would never happen in real life. Gundam's head does not ensure that everyone knows that the characters will die, the cars will be destroyed and rebuilt, the battles will be lost and won, and it never seems as if doing the actions themselves satiric. The magic of Gundam Wings is in detail, and what this series has the most animated would be grateful for it was. Emotions. Instead of mystical, magic, or martial propagation, Gundam Wings is a hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (NOTE: The author would like to declare that Neon Genesis Evangelion is not difficult-line-convincing-in-real life science fiction due to the religious subject that is the core of its series) to love the Star Wars but hates A.I. (the movie). Now, why Gundam Wear and Gundam SeeD are now in production for both Japanese and US releases at the same time with two voice teams. American audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the Japanese season to catch the armed or subtitled versions or even edited SeeD episodes when on Cartoon Network. The emotion is that these two sides are fighting a war technically backward. Heroes are the ones who defend the rights of the richest and aristocratic citizens of Earth from the group of curious terrorists over the victory of any and all costs that make up the protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam wing. This is no war, this is "total war." Each person, each building, each street is a target for attacks, both on Earth and Off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, The only thing seems to change. Types like a present-day flashback, which are fine due to what it reveals about the characters, but at the same time it pulls down the brush between Project: Meteor and OZ. But the latest episodes and sub-Networks on-network (back in 2001-2003) Mobile Suit Gundam Wings: Endless Waltz movie more than make up for the slack.
