I think the film is education. However, it neglects to treat the problem that has provoked numerous conflicts: plural marriage. Also, the movie fails to reveal what the LDS church is. Huge opportunities have misplaced the world that they actually believe. I could not find a clear idea of ​​what it is about LDS's views on central topics of religion. <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. Would have been good to have a clearer picture of how to view more prophets prophets. Maybe such statements are just too controversial to be treated in a movie format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's really exciting life. After all, it provides insight into American thinking about religions of the 18th century. Hope to make some documentary on the fascinating topic, which allows historians to comment on Smith's life. We may have a Mormon President some days. After all, Smith was running for president.
