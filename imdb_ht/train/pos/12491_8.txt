This movie was very good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The act was very good although I thought that the actress Julie could have had more emotions behind her line. Allan was very good and I thought the movie was amazing. I was on the corner of my chair ever while my friends were screaming out and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen. I give it two thumbs up! I definitely would say that if you have not already seen it then go to rent it. If you've seen it, he does not like it and watch it again because the part has been completely real. I also liked how many films were filmed around and in my school campus.
