This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-head that my wife, daughter, and I found it unstoppable. The plot is just crazy but "true ring" in the world of soap opera in all its outrageous and impeccable improbabilities. I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline and Sally Field's performance. I do not have anyone better than Kline's playing THICKheaded. Character really desperate the field character for attention and affirmation - and balancing it almost to its bipolar mood - play nicely against the background of the famous garden (infamous) "You love me!" Oscar Exclamation. Those who can persecute themselves with such a great sole pill are all too rare in this world. <br /> I think this is the only movie where I did not find myself impatient and characterizing Whoopi Goldberg; I thought he was "stuck on" at every note he hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty, and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate. Just a great movie if you're in the mood go for the ride and great!
