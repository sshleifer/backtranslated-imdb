When I rent domino I was expecting it to be very mute. I hate the movie that has really flashy correction and cinematography and Domino also just got very bad reviews. The only reason I watch it is because I love being Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just enjoyed based on reality adventure story. Yes the correction and cinematography were frantic, the story was weak, and the act was mediocre, but I still love this movie for some unusual reasons. Domino was very, very fun and often very funny. She was horribly underrated when she let me think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scotts's latest movie Man on Fire and just just got wonderful entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hates Domino much, though I liked it and recommend it.
