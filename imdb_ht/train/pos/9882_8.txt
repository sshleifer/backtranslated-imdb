Currently on METOO's new schedule of 4 pm on weekdays, right after "Maverick" and right before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> Do not know if I've ever seen an episode in it when it was originally over, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, weird, surreal history put in a mythical West. The type of "Naked City" in the west. The stars are invited to include: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a Mexican treacherous), a young babe Dick Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. .

Also, western veteran actors and country music figures (Immortal "One-eyed, One-Horned, Flying Dead Man Eaters") Sheb Wooley has as seasoned Scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character in a cook you might ask for as "Wishbone". Then there's that great theme song, made by the Frankie Laine Immortal. (Between this and the "Maverick" theme, I've had western theme songs running in my mind all day.) <br /> I look forward to every episode; I picked up the entire set. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is still guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys are struggling to rush out before the commercial. <br /> <br /> Rollin 'Rollin' Rolls ... "
