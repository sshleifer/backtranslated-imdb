A warm, sweet and remarkably movie film about two antagonist workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who is carrying a romance across the mailbox without one of them knowing. The key to success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch holds any absinthe sentimentality sentimentality and appeals to his actors to provide low-performance performance, unfussy performance. As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them. There's a strong undercurrent of sadness running in this movie that I appreciate. Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented by the character of the owner's shop and manager, played by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he has been cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he created for himself is not enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the romance shy between Stewart and Sullavan all the more intensive, because they're both reaching out to this other invisible, who each think of as a soulmate before they even met. Of course we know everything will turn out to the end, but the movie does not let you forget feelings of participation of one of them would feel if they found that the reality did not live up to the fantasy. <br /> <Lubitsch full movie it out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads in chemistry. Small groups of employees shop refers to itself throughout the film as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels us as well. This is a beautiful, romantic ornate. /> Class: A +
