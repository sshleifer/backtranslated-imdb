UC 0079, the One Year War is almost at an end. A neutral colony of Side 6 has been targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon work force. Targets, a new Gundam were built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam legend) inside. When boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, encounters a Zaku after the battle broke out of the colony, he befriends Senior Member MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. Two of them become good friends, Al is treated as an honorable member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a father of Al (whose real father is still working) and seems to be taking with the Federation Pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually to meet .... in battle. So learn that war is not the child to play and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission. For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a good show. Mobile costumes are very well designed, and the animation can look dated, but really shows the emotions of the characters. If you loved 0083 then check this out, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show starting with. If you look at a show for drama and character development, this is one of you, it focuses more on what then mobile fighting costumes. I would miss her more in a drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, war in the pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
