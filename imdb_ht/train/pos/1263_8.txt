I enjoyed this film, awarding it is mostly because I like to see Sean Connery acting with this one having the added bonus of having Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in it too. The story has a grandmother looking for Connery assistance because her grandfather is in prison and says he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems there may be some racist aspect of the case, however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad thing to force a confession from the boy. Well the boy tries to point to another killer closed in the same prison, someone who is about to be killed. He is also a particularly nasty man, as he takes a lot of joy in what he has done, writes the relatives of his victims and tries to get people to send their mail. A lot of twists and turns into this one and some of it being somewhat unexpected. I'm just enjoying Sean Connery's character trying to make sense of the ordeal. The movie also makes me angry in the areas, especially when you find out who finally happens. You get very good interplay between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne as they all look pretty well in this one. At the end of this one makes for a rather good / thriller thriller.
