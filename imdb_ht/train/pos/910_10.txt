It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya back in what it is best in history. We are woven around a wedding. It feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene that you would avoid watching with your family. Though the story is simple and it does not have any new elements, you still love the movie, because of the presentation, performance, and actually about all of the treatments. Hats Off Suraj .. The film is about the fact that commitment leads to love. Presentation of the changes in the way of thinking, behaving once you get engaged is excellent. Director has definitely given it much thought to the actors who made it to perfection. Even if the movie is slow, you do not mind it, because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just want to continue to look happy at this newly engaged couple. As a typical Rajshree it has many sentimental scenes that are likely to make viewers burst into tears (especially ladies). But when you come out of the movie room you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth :-).
