Another love of triyang loves movie from Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, beautifully rhythm and pictures. Bon Boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits Boxer "A Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his partner side by side, holding the Mabel's nice, but versatile (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are lots of characters and Grotesque actors ?? In the marriage of Jack and Mabel to the Verger, standing in attendance at the church, recorded the eye shock of the very high and gentlemen, the Fat Lady, the conjoined twins who, of course, discuss which side of the go sit, and the wedding feast is fun. The rest of the film has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to his heart, or something like that. It was another era altogether, with the audience of evening dresses, and the boxers dressed, too, when out of the ring. The angle of camera, the pace, the use of symbols, the cut is all very stylish and mastery. The camera-work and correction of the latest boxing match is very exciting. The good brill seems to be well used in this one; Her smile is not so subconscious of what's going on around her as she's in the Hitchcock Manxman, and so is not annoying. But does the boxer have such dimensions?
