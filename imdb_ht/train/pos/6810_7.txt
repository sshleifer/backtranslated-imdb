After reading the book, I passed through this DVD at Wal Mart for 3 bucks and thought, sure, what the hell ... I got the DVD and looked it last night. When I started watching it, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, OK cool ... It seemed to run rather slowly, knowing the story and how much he had. Since I got to the real killers, I was like, "how long did this leave?" Check. "One minute ?! What the Hell ?!" I felt so sad many times, thinking that the movie only progressed to a third of the overall story. But then I have noticed that the DVD DVD selection menu includes a part 1 and a part 2. I always had another hour and a half away! I sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the film, even more than the first. <br /> I admitted that I had not seen the original movie 1967 (despite my sincere desire), but I have read the novel and felt that this was an impartial film, for a two-part television minister, what. I think the cast of Perry's role was completely wrong with a minor inconsistency flying from me, but still very well done. The first half shooters are a bit, while the second half is more inviting. I think the movie should be proposed more like Capote made her book: 1/3 before the killers, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after killing the killers. Instead, the movie makes it more 1/2 before the killers, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after killer killers. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less compelling while doing the first half drag on and over ... <br /> Now I look back and realize I was just did the same mistake on doing things dragging over and over, so I'll close the hell up. Go to the movie and make your own curse! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
