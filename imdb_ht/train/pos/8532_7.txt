Lupine sets off for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only sign is a wonderful jewelry that an old man gives him. It is a wonderful place for Lupine, with the desert and warm exotic feel. <br /> One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than Lupine. On one hand the classic dynamics together is missed, but it is a change in speed. Plus, this way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rule. Throughout its features it is seduced by Lupine, and our viewers. Then there's Lara, the girl in this particular story, and she's quite likable. This one has more nudity than any other animated Lupine, which is a fun elegance to have. There's a very entertaining guy ninja who is at the best villain in this, and of course he has some great fighting with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Zenigata inspector of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form. Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is medium and has some slow spots, but all of this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
