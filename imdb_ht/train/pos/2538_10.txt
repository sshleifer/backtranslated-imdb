There are many good things to say on this "B" movie. <br /> "B" maybe in connection but not in commissions. This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen. A class A effort not Universal. The script is well-done, imaginative, and faulty. Writing credits: Howard Higgin original story & Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer handles the complex story with location very well. Do not charge over loads of expenses and locations. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewart's mother "It's a nice life" .. The lead fever, Frances Drake is a beauty and busy his party with favor and pathos for his Karloff husband. Losos similarly correctly underplayed. I think this is the best part I remember seeing it in. As I said there were so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium "X", melting in the stone statues ((a little as the remembrancer of the Little Indian Indians then won None (Agatha Christie) (version of Barry Fitzgerald)), glowing at Karlof in the dark. Even the Karloff was played by Violet Kemble Cooper and distinction .. And because Of all these virtues, I find myself believing in science to describe. I guess this brand is in a good piece of art.
