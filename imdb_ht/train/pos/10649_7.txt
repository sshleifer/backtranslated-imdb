What can I say about it? It is another Hollywood movie support and very high budget (80 million dollars) .Not fear at all, it offers us only a few emotions and a truly creepy sequel to the skeleton. A lot of computers produce special effects and not There is nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress.The architecture of the Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However I do not like the finish because it was so luscious. Check out this one out and train your own opinion on it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
