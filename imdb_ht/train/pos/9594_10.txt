While many unfortunately pass over, the salon scene is still very lively and brings about their legacy. Some are still very lively and well-off, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very accomplished and provides a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just passed over the past year in natural causes, let him live in peace. After Carmen passed the Enji became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza (he was at the beach scene) and is looking more and more beautiful as well. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, they can rest in peace. There is currently another project known as "How do I look?", You can check the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
