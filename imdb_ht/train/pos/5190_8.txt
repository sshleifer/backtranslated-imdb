The advantages of this movie are the amazing battle scenes - absolutely incredible sword-moving and martial arts show. A true John Woo chief. The story tends to be a bit week though, but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of Acrobatics martial arts action. If you are in martial arts movies, you'll love this one!
