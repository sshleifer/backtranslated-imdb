When I saw the movie for the first time in the early 1970s, I was tremble in this movie. Visually it was stunning and the events on the campuses in Europe and USA have made you relate to what Antonioni was trying to say so visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in the mind "Estates" establishments and big business interests. Repeatedly blowing up in the beautiful home in the middle of a desert, the female lead enjoys enjoying the natural stream of cold water, painted a plane of psychedelic design (even the British airways studies made it a few years ago) are some of The images have been copied by advertising personnel throughout the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased the fans after the film was released. <br /> <br /> You see this movie some 30 years later, and you begin to ask why the movie even lost its appeal. Today anti-film films have more substance - facts, documents, fine performance, and superb scenes. Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a defective genius. Even look at Antonioni's "Blow Up" today to give you the feeling as it is keen. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" should be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great movie if you saw it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the TV dwarfed screens. Visual and Horror (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) Attractive film is still alive. The lead scare was not great actors but they were beautiful and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) was killed in prison in USA to extend the reality of the non-compliant values ​​of the movie. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni looks from "five". But look carefully and you'll appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies in the pool, the cops in the air-strip. Real sounds are in contrast to non-conformists. Antonioni was important 30 years ago but his hand in the medium can not even challenge today. He knew what he was doing.
