I'm not sure this comment has a current stack, but I play it safe, so do not read this if you have not seen the movie. <br /> I worship this movie, and so everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent a great part of my working life in movies, without an actor. These are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the directors on-air, the lighters and writers, the people to suit etc. etc., and the whole thing said in their view, at least to a great limits. Most actors are black and self-absorbed in absurdity points, which are the movie films so well but you have been working with the actors to acknowledge that this movie is real life drama! Possible spoiler alerts: in a big scene, the two drives, both actors, _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely out-of-script, and another actor, and start making lines, repeating and each other 's performance critically. Since this movie appeared in, what she was, '91, it became fashionable to do this, especially on television. But hardly any who did it well.
