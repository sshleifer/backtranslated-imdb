Four stories written by Robert Bloch on various people who live in a beautiful, old castle and what's happening. The first to have Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he wrote about coming to life. There are some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good. The second is Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a lattice figure similar to his dying wife. The third is Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. It all drives up into a nice scary finish (although the finish of the story was much worse). The last is a comedy out and out with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both the grinder landscape) and a cape that gets people of vampires! There is also a beautiful line over Christopher Lee playing Dracula. This is a good horror anthology - there is nothing terrifying, but the first one and end of the third gave me a little bit of fun thrill. Also, the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Also the home itself looks nice ... and very creepy. It is well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie scores too. All in all a good anthology training is well worth looking out. Try to see it on the DVD - lion gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
