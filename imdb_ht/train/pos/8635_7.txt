California is a good Hollywood odyssey of suspension and fear that tells of two couples who drive cross-country in California to share the price of fuel: A pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt's "nail" character that is concentrated in this thriller is somewhat predictable. A good look for people in psycho-killer flix.
