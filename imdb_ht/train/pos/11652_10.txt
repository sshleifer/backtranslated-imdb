I came across this movie by accident when listening to all the films I wanted my sister to record for me also I was on holiday, I'm so happy that I included this one. He deals with problems that most directors shy away from, my only problem with this film is that he did for TV so I could not buy a copy for my friends! <br /> It's a story that touches on how people with eating disorders do not necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have diet regimes. It brings to my attention that although the bulimets can keep a stable weight gain, it has the most serious consequences of the health that many people are ignoring.
