This is an "odysessy of time" through computer animation, supposedly th works at more than 300 artists. Made at the end of '80 and released in 1990, this cut off the corners of the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting in spots. Most of the short scenes have made no sense, just shaping forms in other forms, but that was fun to look. This is all about visual, not really about any kind of a story. There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking-beasts would dance around with the birds to hear. All of it is hosting the new computer back then. Even the term "computer animated" was not well-known. It is simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of those cartoon-like and beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just photos and electronic music. Stoners must have really loved this. <br /> It's a nice, intriguing 40 minute "eye candy" and "head candy." By CG effect today this can be a loss of impact, but I think you would still be entertained by this.
