Not one of your hardest-hit stories, and that's a real force in this movie. There are at least two relationships in which fewer confidence writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. There is a Disney-ish moment, particularly near the end, but they are managed. In general, it was worth the rental and it was good, fun to relax. <br /> BTW, if you find the DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to do aloo gobi. We follow his instructions and was BRILLIANT! Next time we'll do it the day before we plan to eat it, because this one dish is definitely getting better and a full night in the fridge leaves the spices out!
