I was waiting for an original photo like this for some time now. Brokedown Palace has that 'hard to believe' aspect, however and ingeniously directed, and scenario, Palace notes great. I really did not enjoy watching Danish Claire in any of her movies, but I'll tell you that, she really changed my mind with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes in a vacation in Thailand where they meet up with a young man who is convinced to take a trip to Hong Kong with her. However, he neglected to inform them that they should bring a number of obscene narcotics to him. Well, finally they get caught, and end up in a Thailand prison. I know, I know, how did you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well if you can get by one small relief, you'll get a very well written, and act out history. Recently I found myself getting into the stories in the movies I watched, and developed a personal feeling for the characters I watched. This movie does not differ. At the end of the movie I get to take care of it for any of the other characters in the movie. Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always Pullman delivers with an excellent performance and film links in very well. <br /> There are some twists and turns that will be, at the end of the movie, you are in tears. This is one of the movies that you most likely spend on when searching for the movies to look at the house. It is my opinion that the future comes from the video store, not passed by this one again.
