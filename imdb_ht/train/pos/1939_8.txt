I do not know why I chose this movie to look, it has a weird title and in the description it just looked like something different. Each time in a short time to try a movie that's slightly different from the main Hollywood hero / thriller cops and this movie certainly was different. Right from the beginning this movie has made me intrigued but I could not figure out why until the end of the movie when I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought the act was superb and the character development really cares about them and hopes things turn out well for them in the end. I think everyone who watched the movie could in some ways relate to one of the characters and this makes for great looks and some good laugh at the sheer banal of the actors. <br /> <br /> In the film's accumulation you definitely get a sense of well-being, and left with 'things will be kind' kind of a feeling. I'm sure this will have wide calls and should give a chance.
