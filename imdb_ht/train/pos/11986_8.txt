I watched 'Talk Easy' a night and thought it was ok, but missing something. Perhaps Buster Keaton unusual speaks to throw me off, or delivery line work in a leading lady. The next day I kept thinking about the movie, though. I could not find Durante songs from myself, I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd's first stage, considering that maybe Keaton made some funny comedy and physical comedy. The next night I watch a scene with Thelma Todd as a corrected girl correcting trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very funny scene, the actors are excellent, their faces, their eyes, their comic expressions. So I watch another scene, the shows are opening on Broadway. The bush of whiteness whitened his every act. Again, I was laughing loudly, appreciating Keaton's clowning and rolling. So the next night I watch the movie all over, and this time I see it for the first time: It's stupid! It is sensational! It's sublime! Three great comedies! Todd dans! Durante chante! Keaton talk! Make sure you are not poifect ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
