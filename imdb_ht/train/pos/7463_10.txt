It looks like this movie polarized us. You either love it or hate it. I loved it. <br /> I agree with the comment (s) said, you just have to "feel" this one. <br /> <br /> Also, early in the movie, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet - an Impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the paint looks like a mess, but at a distance, you can say that the subject is. Cruise mentioned that the paint has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a hint of the moviegoer. This film is like Impressionist Painting. It's film impressionist! And it does not coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear scheme. He asks more thoughts. There are symbols and there are scenes that are around and no, you will not always go to make sure that's going on. But in the end, all explained. <br /> You will need to focus on this movie but I think people are making mistakes in focusing too hard on it. After it's over, it's time to think about it. If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you'll overwhelm your head. Just let it happen ... "go" and read ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> I've found all the performance themselves and think it to be very unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding. <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those of us who did not enjoy it. It appeals to a certain flavor. If you love existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thinking-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then seeing it. If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it. <br /> But if you do like what I have described, then you will surely enjoy it.
