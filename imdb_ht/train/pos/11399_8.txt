Well, so the plot is unstable. Yeah, indeed, so there are some odds of installing and / or dance sequences (for example: Adam's Concert and Henri's action). But somehow, 'An American in Paris' managed to come across it as a polished, first-rate music - largely based on Korea's unbelievable dance talents and choreography, and the trucks of charm it seems to be imported into each scene with Caron. (It needs, because it seems to be a ... problem and emoting.) The most accomplished and technically wavy-inspired technique of this music is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the movie. She's stunningly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance very well. But my favorite number should make Kelly's character singing 'I got rhythm' with a bunch of French-school children, then crushed in an array of American dances. It just goes to prove how you do not need special effects when you have some real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not on the 'classic' levels and 'singin' in the rain ', but beautiful high up there are nonetheless. Worth the look!
