Sure, for her to super and scary scary imagery, it's a great theater theater at the "show" disk, but this is also a touch drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are tied to this film will keep all interested viewers. Young, old, boys and girls seem to find that deep down, we all fans of the vehicle, especially the high performance indy that are the result of blood generation, sweat, tears, intelligence and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound trace perfectly match the visual and content. I do not want to give away the finish, but the sequel to the final drive at Quincy Jones' "Day Like These" just might bring a tear in your eye. Enjoy it!
