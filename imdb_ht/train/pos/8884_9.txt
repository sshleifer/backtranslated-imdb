I really enjoyed the 60's. By being in this generation (I'm waiting for the "80") it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> One big problem in the movie, however, was how the film's imbalance was in the painting of families. According to the promo I saw for the film on NBC, the story was basically about two difficulty families in America in 1960. Now, I might miss something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really think the 60 uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that might be out of the mouths of the actors (all of them very talented.) This is pretty visible in end of the first part (about two hours) in the mini-series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
