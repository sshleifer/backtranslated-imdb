When I started watching "Grim Grim", I had no idea that it was an end to "Crazy Henry". Now the letter was not a movie that I was considering as it had an end. But one has arrived, and it's fine. I assume that you've seen the original, so I will not explain it. This one begins with Fay (Parker Posey) living with his son who he was deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day the son was expelled to bring a pornographic game to school. But this is not ordinary toys. It holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitical than "Syrians". <br /> I must say that I'm quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has accomplished here. Maybe this one does not quite reach the original quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world. And the end of the sheet opens the possibility of another end. <br /> Also begins Jeff Goldblum.
