I watched it subtitled as it was in Russian but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born curse, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. She lived all her life because she was different and because her anger caused her to do the mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love of a young woman named Katya everyone tried to take her away from her ending in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of gore, but not too weak for the weak. <br /> It is not for those who like the regular Hollywood movie movie, but for those who enjoy independent films. Kinda has received the feeling of an Asian fantasy film.
