This film brings back many memories of the classic cinema in the old, where actors did not have to take their clothes to watch their movie viewers. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think the main point in this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it is definitely done in the movie. <br /> I have seen many comments regarding the movie being sick and overly slushy. In this answer, I think that to some degree this is a correct analysis, however, considering this is a Barjatya film I think compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has tone down much. HSSH was almost unbearable to look at some places. In this film however, when the sentimental moments come together, you find yourself smiling, wishing to couple the budding all the best and hope that nothing bad happens to them. Another major point is the performance of Shahid and Amrita. Both acting very well, especially Shahid that looks great in the movie. Amrita seems simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a major star. Although I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, I felt it was too long. Some of the middle could be trimmed and it might have made even more of an impact. I also think that the music, although it fits in the movie when you see the little old fashioned situations and the movie could benefit if a more up-to-date band was available. Although the picturization of Mujhe Haq Hain's and Hamari Shaadi's songs are wonderful. <br /> In all, I definitely recommend this movie, her boyfriend, looks stunning and has a dramatic point (I will not go into detail, just in case you did not see it. <br / > <br /> PS If you're prone to crying-take a tissue! (I needed several)
