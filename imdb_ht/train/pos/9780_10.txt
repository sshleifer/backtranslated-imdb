I saw this movie about the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shocking, is one of the scary cops I've seen. You must be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a great cast of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell as a European Guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, beautiful design production, a very good band and a lot of sophisticated gigantic sfx such as Italian horror movies in the eighties. Meat tears clean in the bone ... and the blood runs smoothly ... this wild lump stopper will flu you ... and give you some dark dreams ... A must-see !!
