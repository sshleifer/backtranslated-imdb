He said Deanna Durbin invented adolescents. This first movie was one of the best. The Funny Story presents a delightful 14 year old Deanna, a little beauty and a gorgeous voice, as the "Miss Fixit" of a family divided by divorce. To summarize the scheme, look at other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. With a good cast to support Barbara Li and Gray as the sisters, good direction and correction, the film succeeds in captivating one even on the next look. In three deanna songs, the only "Bacio" is from the classic repertoire, but when she sings it at the police station scene, where the film in history assures. At least it was for this viewer that at age 15 was hit for life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many beautiful touches that occurs in all three SMART girls is the short preview of the drink stretching her neck for a final glimpse of Deanna as the cops turbish her by! An unfortunate outcome of this film was that subsequent writer for Durbin car came close to the term "Miss Fixit", which soon became stale. Deanna himself has never done. His status as an actress is more skeptical than his charisma, which he certainly had. It seems to me that, as many other movie personality, it replaces "natural" for the histrionic ability that it lacks. The scheme worked well for 21 feature films.
