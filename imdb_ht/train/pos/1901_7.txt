It's hard to put your finger on this one. Basically I suppose it is a comedy about a vicious drink that falls in love with a poor (comparative) girl, whom she wants to marry at risk of being defeated by her family. <br /> It has funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his own character attracted to attract, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil as opposed to his attractiveness, but Jan Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's great sardan prince. but great fun with a memorable band, and running for almost 3 months from our local fleet.
