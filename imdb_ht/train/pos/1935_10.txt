Write something genuine and true. Knowing how to shoot it and put it together without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's movie is one of those places where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by the "big bad bad" and from now on, I will encourage it as far as I can. It's just a shame that I can not have something to show my friends (you know, like a DVD ???), because talking is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can not go to the festivals to discover pearls like that and this movie really worth to be driven out! A great thank you for the staff of this master piece, and I'm waiting for it to be distributed.
