I think this is a great version, I came over here before, help me find out which version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from user comments and then helped I get this version. I do not regret picking this version with neither will you. I tried to watch all the other versions and no matching up to it, Nothing like the book, and TRUST ME if you read the book you want something that will match up with it. When you are looking for something real and move after reading the book it's hard because you want something that will match up with that. I would say God personally leads me to this version. It shows true love for someone. I would say God's love is greatest.If there is nothing better, I would like to see it. but so far there is none like it!
