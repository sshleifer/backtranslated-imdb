I generally like these 1930 mystery / police Charlie Chan types of movies, and this is no exception. However, something looks bad with this movie. An late attempt to change from cinema movies to Moto centered around the scheme compression of a barred salad bar in comedy relief that is like relieving as a sore foot. A typecast buffoon appears to be in the middle of a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem tangled in providing comedy relief. The plot may seem odd or an excuse to make us today, but then the possibility of archaeological epochal discovery was not only real, but a common incident.
