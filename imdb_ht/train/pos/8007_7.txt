This game is very addictive, I kept playing it for hours right until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save a game when you in space contributes to this, at times I just played on them in The orders do not release any data game. So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive, but also flawless. Also for example, something extremely bothered me was that you could not skip any of the cut off and as a result that at times you looked like the minor minus some cut cuts after some time. A great opportunity for my multitask to check my e-mail or have a chat with my friends and more like that, while I had to wait for the cut scene to be on. <br /> The story begins in promising but the more you get the most ridiculous it all gets. Also the game also ends quite abruptly, at least he did it for me. It is quite obvious that they are swollen in an upcoming sequel. I do not know if an end is at work at this time, but I'm sure most likely I will pick one up once it will be released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. Put it boldly, all fools can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and require much effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game that would be a bit too short. But thank God for the multi-player option! It allows you to keep playing short missions, just like the player game once you have finished it in the way. Even though many missions are the same, it just simply remains cool to be in the middle of the massive dogfights times. Graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> addictive game but beware of its flaws. <br /> /> 7/10
