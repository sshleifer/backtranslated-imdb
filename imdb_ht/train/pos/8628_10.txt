The Todesking -Jorg Buttgereit's full-full movie film (one of the first notorious "Nomenclonics") has no central character or character, but rather the continuous themes of the act of suicide. The day's day of the week, a set of set pieces, each of which presents self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, the production values ​​are low and disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is very effective. It makes you think that is Sometimes more important than best entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit's works it is not very spoiled, but there are some unpleasant images like casino scenes in the episode Tuesday, a corpse of decomposition and various acts of suicide.The latest (Sunday) episode is so depressing and full of pain! -Just amazing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10-check this post-modernism shocker! Arthritis in the purest form!
