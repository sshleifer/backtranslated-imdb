On MTV cribs all the ballers and callers Scarface Scarface pulls in classic films from their DVD collection. This can give you an idea that Scarface is a "Gangster movie". Sure, there are gangsters and mobs in it, but that's not the scarface point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refin looking for a new way of life. She fell in with the crowd group and became a well-known drug lord. Montana was all about doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls under my head 10 favorite movies. I would miss her *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie you must see. PHENOMENAL.
