they are highlighting this characteristic of 1917. The pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes head of the family after his father dies. On an island on the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "popular Fisher." My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult for it, but the movie boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on pirate is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directs Pickford in this beautiful movie. Pickford was already a big star in 1917, and this film seems to have been just written for her: Fascinating young woman succeeds on misfortune. Pickford whips reprimand lazy village toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford movie, but always worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and it is good as the strapping island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villages but I could not place it either. My copy interrupts many of the bells and gongs and adds a strange feeling when the bell tower warning signs are blown. Very effective.
