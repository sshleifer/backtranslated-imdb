Come !!! They did so on purpose !! Two of my feats now on TV (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") hook up for a pretty little sleeper / study character. There is nothing fancy to draw, but the act is right on the brand. Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits. Send a look.
