Now I've always been a fan of full moon puppet job. But I must say that Joom Robots are one of the best projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works beautifully, the atmosphere really works with the actors doing a first job job. Gary Graham who really makes his mark on television shows like the SERIES nations and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that it can be an action star that kicks donkeys and takes names. Movement effect movement was a little bit better. The color was wrong, they looked at me plastic instead of the metal they were supposed to be. But this is a minor complaint compared to the whole of Jox's Robot, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Full Movie, then you'll love this movie. 9 STARS from 10.
