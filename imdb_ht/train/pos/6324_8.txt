These guys are nothing but suspicions they teach! They are a whole lot of loving beverages that you want to see get away with it, but they are so hapless that there are so many luck there. There is one better than William H Macy in the man's face with a big hand down on his chances.This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer of perfection, and the rest of the gang were also good too.Luis Guzman brought some funny relief as Cosimo, and George Clooney stole each stage of his role as role.The stage of heist to the end was absolutely hilarious. The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers.There was certainly a Coen Feel feel the movie all and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their career. They have a long way to go to Coen's match, but this is an excellent start and I look forward to the next celluloid outings. ....... "Yo mutha is a whore"!
