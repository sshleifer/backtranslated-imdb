Made only ten years after the real events, and put in the bunker under the Reichstag, the film Pabst is utterly entertaining. It reeks in death of sulfur awaits the perpetrators of world wars. Did not see this in more than three decades, but it remained strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be crawled up in the caves. Securing bit of dialogue between the two general: "Does God exist?" "If he did, we would not." This shame is not readily available for exhibit or purchase because it would be interesting to see and compare this film and documentary on Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" {aka "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" and Bruno Tout.
