I watched this night after seeing it for many years. It really is a little movie fun, with a bunch of figures you did not know being in it. Arkin shines as always. Look at it; you will not disappear. By the way, it was just released on DVD and contrasted with its packaging, it is widescreen. The transfer is rather poor, but at least the movie WHOLE is visible. ;-)
