Greta Garbo American movie first is an analogy of how our lives can sweat course by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, causing us to lose part of ourselves on the road. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with the character Ricardo Cortez Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by his dominant mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a popular opera singer and develops the reputation of being a loose woman. In fact, part of his mood is bitter about Rafael's abandonment. <br /> She returns home to visit her family and eventually meets Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that it is famous La Brunna, and Garbo acts up his role as the diva he really was and re appreciated with these cools of painting it later. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez reminds one of the many Valentino looks at this party, and he groomed to be a Valentino script by MGM, though he never thought he could be in reality and he right. She is credible in an unsympathetic part as a Mama's weakest boy, and allows herself to be largely unrealistic, but funny at the end of the movie. She failed to win Leonora when she returned home, and later when she followed, her courage weakened. <br /> This is beautifully shot shotgun, with glowing stormy sequences and sets that describe Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some good high performances by Lucien Kleinfield Tulers, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of love losing and failing to luck, I do not think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, as she needed a more traditional wife and she was a lot of women careers, and I do not think they were happy in a small village. The finish is true in life and pulls no punches. Watch this one as the first Garbo film star and a precursor to things happen
