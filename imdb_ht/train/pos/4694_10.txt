If you are a fan of Airplane type movies this is a must see! Set in the 1920s and John's Johnny dangerously not only big actors but great lines. "knock down the wall, knock down wall dates and knock down dates # @ $% # @ $ mi." "You should not hang me on a hook johnny" or "sound like Johnnys getting put". It's definitely a parody of the old James Cagney movies and the numerous references. There's a big scene when Jhonnys is walking down the row of deaths and has a priest set up for his escape. Listen carefully to the false readings, its beautiful comics. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Seeing his reaction to Johnny after the Pope's advice, a lot said without making a sound. I recommend this movie to all those who like to laugh or their old movie movie.
