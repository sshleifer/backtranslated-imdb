The first story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods accidentally falls on an assassination of a toddler, and attempts to persuade the murder of the police. Though little dialogue is given throughout the movie, the visual narrative is said by the camera's eyes alone to make the film well engaged. The environment in the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness, which completes the tranquility of the characters themselves. We can also feel the helplessness of the old man's inability to persuade the police to assassinate, that the parental inability of the child to silence tells his own story. <br /> <br /> True horror lies in feelings of despair, helplessness, and irrationality. This film successfully addresses these elements by visual alone, rather than relying on the sound of cheap sound or blood and gore which other bad movie horrors used when the narrative narrows. <br /> <br /> Cleverly, the story unfolds in a rhythm slowly to build tension for awkward momentum and thrilling. The finish is also unexpected and credible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films, such as the "Ring," and "Black Water," or English horror films, such as "The Black Lady," and the "Innocents", this movie gives viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror. I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling of scary to make this movie a try. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies I just mentioned above, you might want to give them a try too.
