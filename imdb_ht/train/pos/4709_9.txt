Okay - I'll confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton was able to do. She makes a beautiful parody of someone doing an imitation of James Cagney, with charm and spare. Throwing in support are solid workers all, and will step right up and perform a fine job in this 80s comedy. A parody of the movies' 30s-'40s gangster, breaking new grounds still, and remarkably original materials. (Well, yes - some of it has been copied since - but then the movie was made, it was original, and many of it was _not_ copied elsewhere.) See Joe Piscopo warns people not to ______, and one of great taglines from parody. See Roman Morony doing things with English profanity that would make your spinster teacher grammar laugh. Watching amazing eyes Gags, like home-store owner Johnny Kelly using price-tag guns on his puppies and lures his kittens. Watch the biggest "video warning" movie ever made. See the worst amazing Latin church to do, while a guy who has never taken class store assembled a Thompson machine gun in part. See the lines you will use in casual conversations for the next decade. See Maureen Stapleton to make the perfect antithesis of the hard-working mother, and surprise gang that you will never come up with. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit your comic bones, be patient - another will come together in 30 seconds or less, and the chances are, you will need to pause until you're done roll over the floor several times. Duckies and Rabbit? They are also. Look for this subtle thing - some of the front gags can go through unnoticed the first few look. <br /> <br /> Some minor defects - but it's probably the best of the parody. Some come close, but none of them are quite good.
