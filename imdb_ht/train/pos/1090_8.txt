One of Cary Grant's most durable comedies is Mr. Blandings Building His Dream House. Although judging by the size of her home would be a dream castle today. Always Cary did a good living in the advertising field even though he had a demon in a time trying to come up with a slogan for Ham and the brand name of Wham. What made this movie popular was the lack of housing in World War II post. Returning veterans to the war claimed their rights under the Right of Right of Rights which included home loans. The problem was literally not enough to meet the demand. Around the time of the book Eric Hodgins and the movie was so popular Congress passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing law that put the government first-time in the home business business. I had an uncle and aunt who was around the same time building their own home where they moved in to fifty very early soldiers. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of Rochester inner city. Where they were not as great as a home in Connecticut and eighteen rooms, they still lived the rest of their lives the way Cary and Myrna were most likely to do. <br /> Of course it was expensive and costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send Cary into cleanup products. Cary and Myrna also had Melvyn Douglas around to offer advice, usually too late. Truths say it's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary know it. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Charles Nora. If you can imagine Charles's move to the country with William Powell with the Cary Grant headaches, the movie would still work just fine. Blandings builds his dream home still works well as comedy because of the universal situations. And this review is dedicated to my Walter Uncle and Aunt Kate who lived in dream home together for more than 40 years.
