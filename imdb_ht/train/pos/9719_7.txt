Going to this movie, I've heard good about it. Coming out of it, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a character instead of many children as his other movie. There was a couple of laughs here and there - nothing too funny. Probably my favorite part of the movie is when it dances in the club scene. I totally have to try this out next time I get to a club. A couple of stars here and include: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, Chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite fun to see a comic appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. It's the course of a movie before and Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a thrust up, you'll either enjoy it to a limit or get it a little dull. I would add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
