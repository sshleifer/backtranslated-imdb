This remarkable movie can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons of "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it's almost useless to do that. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a series of fairy tales, "Stardust" is so much different than any other fantasy movie / sci-fi I've ever seen. It's like a hybrid of these folks, but its plot and script are so unique that - along with their performance, special effects, cinematography, and scores - the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has never appeared on the screen agent. Secondly, the very effective note of simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushes the story together, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement is needed to make the magic credible in the domain in places where characters exist. Third, I did not get the movie to be even remotely hard to track or confuse in any way. In fact, the exciting interplay between the three three subplots actually made it even more compelling to watch. Beautiful cast, and superbly acting across the board. This fantasy adventure (and subject-element) was one of the best I've seen since the "Return of the King" (not that I compared the two of all). OK, so it's not easy to sum up, but does not leave any gross and / or heartless and cynical or pornographic film in PR to prevent you from participating in the best time you might have in the summer movies (or even possibly in a long time)!
