Deliverance is fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing stories by James Dickey, becoming a brilliant film by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who are spending a high-rise boat weekend up in the mountains. They are there, dealing with every dark side of people with all the worst forms of human misery ... poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four people wanted to travel down the river for adventure and excitement, but their travels soon changed into an odyssey across a violent and mountain-landed cache, completely derived from all forms of civilization. All these elements actually deliver one of the most wild films I have ever seen. Just about everything that happened to these guys, you pray that you will never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Most movies speak, deliverance is also a very important movie. The best John Boorman (well followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still - a very influential movie and has several memorable scenes that are already featured in other movie cinemas. Just think about the terrific "dueling banjos" music notes and, of course, homosexual unforgettable "squeal like a pig" rape scene. All the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performance. Especially Jon Voight. A must see motion picture !!
