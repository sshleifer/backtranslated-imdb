I heard a few friends one day saying that "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to make another godfather put in the early 80s." Now I usually listen to idiot / watch CNN so I decided I would stay away from it. Then my boyfriend gave me the DVD, saying, "This is # 1 with the pelicangs", confused I tried it. This is the best movie each made. It is more realistic than all this crap on stolen racing cars that are too expensive for someone in this area could pay (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) Some humor though ... i.e. The Pelicangs and Light 80s music. Still, what's better than Al Pacino touching a m203? I give this ***** from ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
