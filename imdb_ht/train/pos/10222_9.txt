The duo is easy at Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subjects of the Angel Levine. It's one interesting blow to the terms of It's a wonderful life. Zero married to Ida Kaminsky and the two are part of a special class of poor Jewish adults in New York. Mostly used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly drowned. It is reduced to apply for welfare. In despair like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out of God for some help. <br /> Now maybe if he had someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing to go for him, it was over 100 years of this mortal coil and its ties on things the earth had gone. God sent Sentel something quite different, Harry Belafonte has recently died that should have at least provided some basic training for the angels before they gave a placement. Belafonte has not accepted it has moved out of life, it's still a lot of trouble. She also had a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know she was over, hit by a right car at the start of the movie. You put his problems with the problem of the Most Holy and you had a good deal, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew called Levine. <br /> This was the performance I left for Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who received a nomination for best comedy at the shop on Main Street a few years back. The other important role here is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea plays a wonderful Jewish doctor. Remember O'Shea's brogue from the Verdict, I was really surprised to see and heard him bring to the party of the doctor. Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. It has led to you by a stellar cast and of course created by writer Bernard Malamud. Be sure to catch it when streaming.
