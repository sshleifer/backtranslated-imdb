I saw a track from this DVD in a Hi-Fi show in London 2006 (I was not really in ice cream until now!) It was an end of Arcam end, it sounded great with dts.I had to find DVD this and I'll tell you this is by far the most interesting DVD I've ever looked at. The Ice Cream Performance was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best I've heard about a music DVD. It does not matter what kind of music you like, this one will definitely grow on you. It's the absolute brilliance of the performances that will make you look it again and again. Even new musicians do not cut the mustard these days, like these old rockers do.
