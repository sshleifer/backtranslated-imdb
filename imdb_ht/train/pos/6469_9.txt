This is a really great short run from Hal Roach. This is because of two main reasons: the littlest kids of the short are among the cutest ever been on film and the plot has many funny and well written elements. <br /> As for the littlest of the Little Rascals, I honestly can not think of a kid cuter than the Spanky on four ages. Although being a chubby kid and unpleasant in years later, it was just costly here. And, putting the little boy in charge of babysitting the same children were not only funny, but once again high on the beautiful factor. <br /> <br /> After the older spanky blackjack children perform this awesome babysitting job, all sorts of funny broken mayhem loose. Gag is very effective and well-designed for the time - with a crash accident involving a murder and a final scene where Spanky FINALLY becomes the smallest control of being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts in several decades and I'm glad I gave this one a chance.
