Remembering these stories sincerely and in the first place, in the future is not too far away, we see a young boy preparing for the test day, state i.q test. The boy is somewhat annoyed as his parents' concerns as some of his friends have already done it before and eventually go to the test. When it comes to getting a shot and it's curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that he's just sure he tells the truth. The boy then asked, yet believing, why not he? It is later and parents are sitting awaited by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state is sorry, but their child's level has exceeded the national quotas and ask politely they would like a private jury. A corker in a conclusion scene! A message from Charity was a hearty story about a mental fluid connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. That pan in a strange story of magic accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A beautiful story and a happy conclusion.
