This is one of the best comedy ever! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so great. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he does (as always) a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this film, you have no sense of humor.
