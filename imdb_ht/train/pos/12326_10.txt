I saw this movie first at the Berlin Film Festival, and I never saw Hong Kong movies before. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so quick, and was not a boring moment throughout the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic scheme. My favorite scene is when Taoist drinks, singing and fighting for herself - one of the many scenes that stress the extraordinary musical elements of the movie. This movie is a definite must !!
