A good film and - for its time - an intense, sporadic, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's "looking" even if not so brutal. The story begins fast and does not leave, with several scenes of really good dialogue between Jeff Webster (Stewart), Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is in some ways reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann-Stewart work, but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting. There are some drawbacks: a too-quickly wrap up (and rather sensitive) ends; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convinced as a French naive teenager, and of course the film takes place in the Mythic West, a land that fills the real laws of nations and physics does not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is amazingly good as a nut, those who think it cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can not be beat. A fine western costume drama.
