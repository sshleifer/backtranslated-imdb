Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> While watching the Lion King 1 1/2, I can not help but have mixed feelings about the entire movie. It is definitely a great way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the Lion King did. The story, for those who do not read the other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumbaa meet, and how they affect the event of the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are actually some very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is by showing the fear of increasing Simba. However, for me the worst parts must be when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with the events of the original. I can never look at "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel Love Tonight" sequentially again (I'm okay with "I just can not wait to be king" sequel). <br /> Voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, as Matthew Broderick, the guy who makes Rafiki, and the Hypnosis. Even the actor who has just killed Simba sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me. But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu? It literally had only 2 lines, and neither were very needed. Adding to Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only adds to the talent, although you still can not hear the timon's mother voice and do not think of Marge Simpson. Some similar scenes do not fit in with the original, the one coming to mind was when they proudly rocks to the end. How did they have time to fit in the initial battle with the Hypnosis? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, you can not help, but feel that for a set of discs 2, the special features are especially missing. They could easily fit a comment, or another aspect ratio on the first disc. I liked "Who Wants to Be King of the Jungle" game, though it is the most shameful example of the promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are actually difficult. <br /> Overall, a good movie, but not nearly as good as TLK or even TLK2.
