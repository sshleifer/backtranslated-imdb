People remember that there were several King Kong ripoffs - Congo, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), are all ripple with each other, but Yeti stands on its own. It only lends one element from King Kong and this is the animal's attraction and a girl. <br /> <br /> The Yeti-based Bigfoot (not as King Kong) and archaeologists have captured it, at one time they exist, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but its worth watching it. The first time I watched she was about "Elvira's Mistress in the Black Show" in the early 1980s. She was throwing down my spine as a kid, especially when the YETI became angry. I saw it again, around 1:00 am on ABC over 2 to 3yrs ago. See it again to appreciate it more, it has some good overall effects (for its time) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Also the music is very cool, its very YETI like. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Butians to create a great monster like atmosphere. <br /> Vote 7 and half from 10.
