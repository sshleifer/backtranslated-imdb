I saw this movie when I was a teen on television (Thank you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and had a bad dream about it for years later. Trnka was one of the advisers for Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's National Host Board Board. Pojar was, in turn, an adviser and collaborator for the Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see "Angel Night". The symbolism is obvious, but deftly used. The opposition to beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition to the anonymity of the glove. The puppet hero is poorly condemned despite a lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remembered was the feeling of asthma in the decor. Small room where the action takes place is the whole world. The invasion by hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunted movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by Trnka in the public library and showed it to my own kids. A must see.
