This is the kind of Hollywood movie needed to do more. No morning accessories, there is no car chases, no smart one-materio. Just related people were people. William Macy plays an easy Hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the child of duty, Sutherland is the dominant father. Son wants out of business, Dad will not let him. Macy loves her own son, playing very well by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). She also started to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl she met in the waiting room at his psychiatrist office. It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and films in following the assassin's reluctance as it balances his own needs and that of his family. There are many touch scenes, especially between Macy and his boy. And as you would expect in a movie with William Macy in it, there is a bit of humor too. <br /> <br /> Excellent work all around, actors and directors. Nice knowing they can still make a good movie in Hollywood on a small budget.
