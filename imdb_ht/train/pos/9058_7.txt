I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was oringinally supposed to eat 15 glasses in 15 days, by 10 glasses in one day by 7:00 pm. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get 30 dollars after he ate all the worms. In the movie after Billy feeds all the worms, Joe went to school with worms in his pants. Joe is supposed to be some of the worms but in the movie, it's not at all. <br /> <br /> Even if there is a change, this film is still one that the kids will enjoy.
