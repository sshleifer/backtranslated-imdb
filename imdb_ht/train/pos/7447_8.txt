The movie may go a little far, but if you like to show it to what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you do not like the show, do not see the movie. It starts to slow slightly, but then pick up, it turns out to be very funny. There is even a "heart-wrenching" scene toward the end. After all the protagonists went through these senses to get you. Also Jerry launches in his opinion why show his crowd and justify the show's demands. It has a very good point. We care very much about the private details of life celebrities, so why is it wrong that these people say private lives on national television, too. If they were celebrities we would not mind at all, we would eat it. We do not like to invite him to do that just because they are poor garbage and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamor movie stars living in a "Beaver in Beaver" world?
