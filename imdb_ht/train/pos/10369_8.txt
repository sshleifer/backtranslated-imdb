"A cry in the dark" is a mastery of movies, haunting, and incredibly even provocative. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a terrible eye, seeing her 3-month-old babies were brutally taken from family families, while camping on the Austrian flood . Azaria (the baby) has never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance has caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep makes immunity justice for Lindy's role, as he always does. But one thing that helps "a cry in the dark" never falls flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspiring and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, the tears are brought into the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and then you're left haunted, but also inspiring.
