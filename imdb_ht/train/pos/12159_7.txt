- After their son was sentenced to life in jail, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) began receiving calls threatening phones because someone was ringing their son off easily. The pair decided to get to California to save the advertising at the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that is soon to be very successful. One of the students has a father without father and Adelle quickly fell in love. In the meantime, Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio. It is only a material in time before everything falls apart and women enter into a world of madness and murder. <br /> - I can not help but compare what is the matter with Helen? For those who sleep Auntie Roo?, Also begins Shelly Winters. Where the movie seemed almost prevented from its presentation of the Auntie Roo Madness, nothing caught Helen back in this movie. It can take a good time in the movie movie, but once it's off, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with it. Winters are so delightful that it is impossible that I do not enjoy its performance. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but things Helen is capable of being totally over-the-top. <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in his role as the gold-defender dancer. I got the impression that he thought he was in a movie that would get him nominated for some awards. This is not Citizen Kane! Let's act so seriously. Hey, Debbie, does not you realize that you are the main goal is to be a victim of Winters' Folklore .. I just love those ex-fi-star-in-the-twilight-of-the-movie horrors. What's the matter with Helen? is like fun like any.
