This is an awesome action movie with huge one material from Arnie !. It's stylishly made, and many strain action keeps one satisfied. The characters were frightened, and Richard Dawson, very ominous as the main villainer. Yes he has tons of traps holes, however it is very fun, with a great finish as well. He had a great story, too, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. Character development was also very good, and, some superb performance. Direct is great !. Paul Michael Glaser, doing a very good job here, and using scary colors, keep it stylish at all, angle camera cracks, and in general keep the movie at a very fast pace! good job. There is a little bit of Gore. We get a wound of single blood injuries, exploding head, throat throat, blood clots, blood clots, blood, and a scar. The actress is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is amazing as always, it is excellent in the acting department, there are tons of hilarious criticisms one, kicks that ass, and as always is a great physical presence!, And it was tons of fun to look! (Arnie Rule!). Maria Conchita Alonso, doing well here, she was really nice, and she was good chemist with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, is decent here, and what he did, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, is good as the guy geeky guy, it was cool! Richard Dawson is scared like the main villain, and he was very ominous, and was pleased to look. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch, and Prof. Toru Tanaka, all have to do very well as the stalkers. Usually you must see! **** 1/2 out of 5
