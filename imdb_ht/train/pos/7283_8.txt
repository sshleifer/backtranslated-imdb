I like to buy these cheap, disgusting DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I got to buy this one. The perfect film of science fiction film in the 50's, all sexed up. Replaced with all unscientific everything, cuddled with many melodramas, it's an enjoyable movie, giving people who appreciate this kind of stuff. But if you can 'stop your disbelief' enough, you can actually get nailed - not only by the psychotic head or by beating the thing in the closet, but towards the end, and characters of the 'perfect body'. So. . . . what is another word for mindf *** ing?
