For a low budget film this was really good. I put this much higher than your B-movie action action. Sean and Corinne released in this movie, and did not seem shy camera. Watch out for fellow Jeanne and Jared. I did not think that the producers would even consider that, but their runner-ups deserve so much. <br /> I'm going to be looking forward to more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very genuine, and Corinne's sexy character was very difficult-nozine and on point. It connects well with the sequence of actions and executes with confidence. It was a great idea to throw Billy Zane as the spirit of spirits and witty ones. Charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was very good. The action sequences were not cheese and seemed to connect to the movie. Of course there were defects, but that came with the territory. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that he did for TV. Sean and Corinne have done a great job considering they are new to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared, and the rest of Next Next Action players get their chance to join the co-stars of entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Final Trial: *** / ****
