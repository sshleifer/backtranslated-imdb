This film is one of the most painful, sophisticated and painstaking paints in the mentality that seems to have invaded the Balkans again, 45 years after the show. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing should be the most appropriate answer. The precision of painting and the timelessness of the qualities, however, make it for a great movie to look if one wants to understand a little bit of what has led ex-Yugoslavia in its madness. In fact, no diplomats deal with the region should try anything until they see this movie, with its twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
