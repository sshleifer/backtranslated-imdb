Bad period of fun pieces set in the 30s, it's a turn on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "adventurer of the Lost Box", is only done on a low budget and campaign by director Michael Anderson. The opening of the lens of the liberal amount of Gothic art nuveau, predicts Batman by two decades. Starting Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a hero perfectly cast and gay Pamela Hensley as the local Latina Mona tagging on our hero on a non-existent goldhunt country in the Latin American in Hidalgo. Best line, our hero Mona, holds a point in his chin as you expect him to be sensitive to him and give him a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!" Paul Wexler's Black-and-Blackhat cheese, Captain Sea is an absolute pleasure. Expect a little "adventurer ..", an outlet of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Horizons Lost" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for Michael Berryman's favorite cult in a small part of undertaker and enjoy the use of John Philip Sousa's patriot music campus. A first candidate for release DVD, it is certainly late. An indisputable treat for the whole family. 9/10
