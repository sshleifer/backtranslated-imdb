I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and I've always continued to return and verify when they were actually produced. They are absolutely scared of being placed on the fun of what should be in the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or they are strange, weird people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bro frat Bush's invading the white house dressed like Arab handling rifle? Bush 'accidentally' executes someone? (No, wait ... He did this by doing so as Gov.) This might have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time, but must now be considered brilliant, if spooky, and pressed.
