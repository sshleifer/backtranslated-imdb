While the band is somewhat dated, this story is much more important in the US now than ever. Not only does collar work collar but work everyone who was outsourced by US corporations while government revenues and Americans suffer. Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker who works his father's work for 35 years. His wife is well-described by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory lost his job. The mill closes under the pretext of movements, but there are also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month (outsourcing) these should pay Strauss / Emory a day. Never think these guys are the true faithful workers who value and try their best for their families. John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss' brothers) and some other co-workers are also affected. It's very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and her dad are moving. Emory expects his local union to be able to re-open the mill, as promised. Emory's brother, Lee already saw the writing on the wall. There is no work left in the rye-belt (Ohio) and must be moved on. However places in the U.S. can be moved to. Where will it be best for a blue-collar steel worker? <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end of which Emory and his crew complete the dock packed with steel products. The guard allowed them to do this as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and has sympathy. <br /> In general, a good movie movie about hard times here in America. Something that some care fails to personally affect them. 8/10.
