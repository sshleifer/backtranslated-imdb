This movie is full of intricacies and difficulties in navigating the ever-shifting limits of deaths, race relationships and desires. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There is no car chases, no building explodes, there is no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by short eyes, minimal gestures, spatial limits, lighting and leaving things - sometimes very officially - reluctant. It's about identity, memory, community, belonging. These different parts of the movie work together to strengthen the leitmotifs of self and other, identity, desires, limitations and losses. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will hurt people who have palace demanding explosive, massive, spicy actions. It's a very well-filmed human story. That's all.
