I first read the book when I was a teenager, then saw the movie late a night. About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered any available copies. I then hit the internet and found a site that offered movie movie, soooo happy that I did, ordered a copy and sat back and could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> In my opinion really enjoy the movie I suggest you read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is not in print but I did follow a copy down via E Bay-, Alan White's author was a commander / paratrooper during the 2nd world war to take part in disparate Clandestine surgery and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe to provide the book with authentic films. I did not give the film a ten only because of the nature at the end of the movie, not as good as the book. There are a couple of draw lines that are different from the book, which is strange as the book is not about the great scale of war, but about the person of war. The movie shows this exceptionally well. I have copies of the book to let my child read and the movie let's look in this order. <br /> <br /> If you can follow it down the book and the movie then it is definitely worth it and I only want it to be readily available for the more read and see, one of the most successful movie films my good, ever!
