This is a perfect set for family watch. We collected through the television watching this on BBC America. It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching exploit Robin's next. We can not wait for the next weekly episode and are happy for free "On Demand" look. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a place in fashion now. There is a moral in every story. It's fun. Violence is not over-the-top or useless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and feels like a John William. It's an old world story that has brought in life again with a new world flair. <br /> There are plenty of garbage on television from the brain's rotten "reality" television nonsense violence. You should take this for what it is and that a "Robin Hood" is updated not to be compared to the movie exploits at Errol Flynn. This gem is to be enjoyed by all. Parents who are concerned about their childhood are overwhelmed by violence that Robin loses his taste for war and bloodshed. It's a Hood Robin who would rather try to solve his way from a fight disorder. Marian Girls are also a model for the role of young girl. Rather than standing by and doing nothing, she took her own role in helping the poor by being the "watchman at night." The Sheriff of Nottingham is delightful about the villains themselves, as the Sheriff should and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne plays by a very beautiful actress, one that most women want he did not have to show the role of a "Guy Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Frat Tuck?"
