This is a modest, comedy drama character, filmed in Brazil on a low budget. The first is familiar, the same as in the film Danny Kaye 1950 ** On the Double **: someone who, like a joke, makes an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to imitate the person for real. <br /> Conversely between the two leads is very effective. Raul Julia as the German-paradise secretary, is high, cool, threatening and Latin. She sports an obvious dye blonde god. Richard Dreyfus, anime, short, New York Jewish, is funny and sympathetic. There are many references and inside jokes about business shows. <br /> The environment is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was indeed ruled by fifty soldiers earlier in the late eighties by General Alfredo Stroessner, a military dictator who had not elected father papa emigrated from Germany. But the writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he depicts Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with great disparity in wealth and an active guerrilla incidence. Further in this vein, Mazursky's funny cartoon Jonathan Winters as an American retired in the truth is C.I.A. station head of Parador with a so powerful figure that it can give the president of the country a profanity-laced outside mill. In fact, US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without social and racial tension to see elsewhere in the region. This is due to the country that has been fighting long and costly war against major neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost wiped out both times, but the society that emerged patriotic, radiogenic and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On yet another level, there is a feminist bow in the form of Madonna's character. Played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockgeed girl's presidential pleasure to start the movie, but is seen on TV as president himself in the end - now politically and cosmetically incorrect, not no makeup, hair is pulled back, swept in office by a velvet revolution. Once a such event occurs in Latin America, the Isabel Peron administration (not the beloved Evita, never-made office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
