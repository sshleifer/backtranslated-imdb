This film kept me guard when he started out in a Cafe located in Arizona with a Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Easy Falling", '04, decided to have something to eat and become all hot and bothered a very hot, sexy waitress. While Rex steps out of the Cafe, she sees a State trojan and asks her, "Did you fast?" and then all hell break loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed To Kill,", '80, is a TV reporter and is constantly looking for a news release effort. Maggie van goes up in a hot tub and Rex comes to a call and tells him he wants a show down, Western style, and top head cop in town. This is a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are only two actors who help this photo together!
