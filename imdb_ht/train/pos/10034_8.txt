I had some problems with this movie, and I heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is more than three hours long, but I was surprised that it went by quickly. I do not think it is overrated at all, I think IMDb's rating is perfectly decent. The film looks rich, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of her best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals all of his scenes in the story's story very rich in detail, and is warm about the character development, obvious and the love story that is very moving when it needs to be, even in the first bit of His movie is a bit slow. The last hour is very fixed, and I will confess that I was on the corner in my place, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very moving. The music note by James Horner was nice, though I've never been a big fan of this song, my heart will go on. The 1996 miniseries were good, but suffered from freelance scenarios and some historical blunders. In general, I give Titanic a 8.5 / 10th Bethany Cox.
