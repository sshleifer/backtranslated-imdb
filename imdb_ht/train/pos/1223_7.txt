About a year and a half ago my dad told me about the French Doors. I thought it sounded interesting enough but I did not try to find it anywhere. Then about a year ago I remembered that film and thought "hey why not" and tried to find it on the internet. eventually after about a week in which I found it on the film of atoms. I called my dad on the computer, saying "hey dad i found that movie crap you told me about the age of that!" She smiled at me, turning round the lights so she was black black apart from the computer screen and told me to look at her. I started fine ... Then when he started getting worried about everything that I had to find he was very unnerving. In the end I pushed my seat back and stood up ... it made me jump !: If you have not seen this film I highly recommend you do because it is well worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time it is still unsettling. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM!
