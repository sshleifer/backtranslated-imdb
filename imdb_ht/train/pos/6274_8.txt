I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends a night. I did not really hear much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after I saw it, I really love it. Nicolas Cage and the rest cast was very good. But I must say that the performace Giovanni Ribisi needed a little to sting up. But such a small flaw, it might overrided. <br /> Gone in 60 seconds is about a nursing machine thief that must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is in no way predictable. So the finish would be a surprise. Think it just another, movie car driving fast? Well you partially right. There is much more to it. Everyone should take a look at this movie.
