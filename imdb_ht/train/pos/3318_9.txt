A very beautiful movie with a great background offered by the City of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and adds light films, he hit a homerun for me. Many laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past Bosox failures. And how pleasant he was to watch a movie and a baseball theme without having to keep an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving Kevin Costner trying to make believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young love-hitting suffering couple from Jimmy's Bosox "jones". It was a bit whacky and out of the field left, but there really are Sox fans that are fans and live their lives in the fortunes of their beloved team. The film alongside a fast pace and the finish, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular movies, without being overly pretended. <br /> <br /> Also enjoyable was the return of the Willie Garson screen. I miss ever-popular "Stanford Blatch" in Sex & City. It's still funny, even when it does or does say so much. <br /> So buy yourself two box chairs, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. "Fever manure" is a winner.
