Well, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help offset the rating rating from the handful of the boso that gave this movie zero or 1 star review. Each of the segments for this Anthology shows great potential and promises for the talented filmmakers ... Three of them have gone on to achieve remarkable success in Hollywood's long-term production. Performance varies from rough all the way up to completely impressive, with remarkable turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and James Brion. Martin Kove can be a great melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotism and the Freaky-Strobe-Lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally dimwitted as a unsuspecting mud victim. But in general, it has some big laughs and some moments are really scary. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
