Exciting amusement boat! It has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention - an absorbed story of intrigue, a fire damsel fire named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) in the irresistible Mr. Hawke's (Errol Flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. They make a fine fine romantic sweetheart - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is to say, the bad pirate dip his website to split and conquer. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick played a support role as Ms. MacGregor, the protection of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). It is beautifully landscaped scenery of shorelines, boats, and the bay. Many of the actions of Swords fight clashes, battleships, daring leaps at Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board boats!). From the flaming trumpet myself I heard once in an interview with Maureen O'Hara that he was very pleased with the order in the bullwhip and he could also fly Flynn into battle wars in those days, but should not have to put it's the test here. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable movie.
