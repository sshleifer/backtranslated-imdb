I understand that Paramount wanted this movie with the Rodgers and Hart notes, but could not work out these copyright issues, so Burke and Van Heusen wrote among their most songs for Bing Crosby contributing a very nice note. > <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film, "Fit Crosby like a glove" and I could not have put it better. No, it's not Saturn Mark Twain, it's a Bing Crosby movie and in 1949 Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood. For once Paramount was used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never lovelier on the screen. This was a woman who was technologically invented for. <br /> <br /> Brooklyn's origin William Bendix is ​​standing out, but it's a good comic effect. The trio of Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a good time rolling and busy doing nothing. Bing has one of his patents patented philosophical calls and if you wipe your toes on the Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song she singles once and for Always Alone with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for best singing, but she lost her baby to cold outside. <br /> Well also that Bing manages to record the score for Decca and Rhonda Fleming with Bendix and Hardwicke. One thing I love about this movie is that it shows Crosby's funny talent without Bob Hope. I love the Road Pictures, but Bing was a funny talent on her head and this movie best demonstrated than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his toys.
