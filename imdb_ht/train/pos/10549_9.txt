I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it gets wide wide because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than up to the job. Any discussion about the scheme might be <br /> <br /> regard as mob, so I'll just say that the storyline is smart, the act is superb, and the amazing effects. Well filmed and rhythm too. One of the best films I've seen in age, and very refreshing in this summer of sadness <br /> <br /> movies. He had the audience laughing the whole time. Watch it if you can. (I particularly liked the "candy bars!" Coffee bar!)).
