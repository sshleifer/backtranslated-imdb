I saw this movie only once, on TV, and it was not repeated. This is strange when you consider the garbage that repeats over and over again. Generally movies sincerely for me is an entertainment source, but this one really scares me. <br /> <br /> Do not read later in the next if you've seen the video <br /> Little cursing is when the townspeople pursue the preacher where his wife lies almost dead (they would have poisoned her). He asks who hell is you man anyway. One does not give one true identity. The girl who pretends to be deaf in order to rot and seduce him saying "I'm Lilith, the Witch who loved Adam before Eve".
