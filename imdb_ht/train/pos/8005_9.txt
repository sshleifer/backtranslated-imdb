I bought this game on eBay heard that it was a similar elite game. The gameplay is very similar, and it is very addictive. Once I played it a couple of times, I immediately returned to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too. I played this game the right and the storyline to do it Feeling as if you are actually in a movie, it's brilliant. If you have problems feel free to explore because of the restricted nature of the storyline of the single-player game, simply set up a freelancer server on your own PC (easy to do with the software included) and play in your heart's content. There are still a great number of freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer with no problem and not all that is threatening, because you do not often mean other players unless you want. So go find a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. Depth of this game is staggering, with great systems to explore and debris to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planes, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially as you can find it for a couple of hairstyle on eBay. Get one with the complete writing manual if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it's best!
