When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15 maybe) I was really impressed! It has been completely different style compared to the Japanese animation and I like it much more. Tho all the impression of the film is more disaster and black ... the colors are not that ... color. Characters do not talk much, there is no long and boring conversation in this and that (as in the Ghost of the Shell) .With its black photographs, views on strange creatures and the sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian history, full violence and horrendous creatures, enchanted forest and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, throlls, orcs ... and one mysterious hero to stop evil.
