In this film the year 2022 looks much like the seventies. This is fun at first, but quickly the viewer perceives how very different that futuristic decadal world is despite their appearances, how many things that we take for granted could become available. Characters often communicate in a specific way, with no tact and behavior or respect. I believe this is intentional, not a bad act. After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 a overpopulated resident behave like that. <br /> I did not like most of the action stage, apart from the death of the priest: too cheap even for the sixties. The plot is not too polished. But the great scenes and ideas - such as the death of Sol, the carpet road and the bodies faced with, the "furniture" - overlooks the shortcomings of this movie. <br /> 8 out of 10.
