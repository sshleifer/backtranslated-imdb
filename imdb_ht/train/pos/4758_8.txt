After an anonymous telephone call on a spacecraft that would have crashed into a frozen wood, two police officers found evidence that the event really happened and apparently one Martian was walking away from the place. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way caf√© and get a bus stop and seven passengers are waiting to reopen in a snowed bridge. However the driver says he was only six passengers when he parked the bus. While interrogating the travelers, strange things happen to the diner, and the lights change over and over and the earth turns over and over. When the passenger is released and the bus follows his journey, one passenger returns to the diner and releases an invasion scheme on Earth. "Do You Really Want The Marble?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations with a surprising and totally unexpected plot point at the very end. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
