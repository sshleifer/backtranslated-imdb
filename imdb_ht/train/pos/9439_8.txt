Before watching this movie I heard a lot about it with certain scenes in the movie, but listening did not make it to me so I planned on watching him and Wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an exciting group of bunnies hell on canoing down the Cahulawassee River and the series unfortunately in events that sweep over them all. The character development takes some time in the viewer's envelope with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys as being your friends. Acting, the very real dialogue, as close to reality as you can find for Hollywood acting. Character Reynolds "Lewis" was interesting as a guy from very difficult, but under the guise of Manli lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight looks like the character on the most important spotlight The more, the unfortunate circumstances seem to get him to every corner really mold and helmet to someone else at the end (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like the funny lunkheads that just love jokes around and do not seem to get too terrible terribly unless they are too, and they did ... I really was amazed at Boorman's vision of Dickey novel , very impressed. You can not go all your life without looking at this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
