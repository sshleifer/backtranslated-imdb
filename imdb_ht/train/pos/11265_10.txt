I never really knew Robert Wuhl before. But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is. This special HBO introduced him to teach "American history" in the New York film university student and the man was just phenomenal. It poked fun at almost every historic key event held not only in the United States, but there are other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a big satire that made me wonder if what I accepted as the true storyteller true is really true. <br /> I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedians and made learning a lot more interesting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and wants to want to question what his / her beliefs are.
