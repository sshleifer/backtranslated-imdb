I saw this film in the theater when it first came out a few years ago and really liked it very much. But I still wanted to see it again this year to check whether it's still good compared to movies coming right now, and I say it is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!! !!! !!!! <br /> What you need to know is that you do not have to miss any minutes of this movie, if you do not completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good, you can not expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Producer!
