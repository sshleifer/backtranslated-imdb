Grim Grim is the continuation of a story beginning ten years earlier with Hartley Henry Fool. I have not seen the movie earlier, and I do not know if it's a good thing or not. I can only consider the current film on its own basis. <br /> For most people, the Hal Halley style movie is something that you either love or do not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and circle, ironic humor is really reasonable to me, and Grim Grim is no exception. It was a time of smart-writing parody that was my head and much of the Melbourne International Film Festival loud laugh audience. For the first half of the movie it was relentless and deliberate with extreme breakthrough. It is a style of humor sadly lacking in movies and a welcoming relief in the stupid youth comedy that Hollywood pumps out like pancakes. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the film, the humor begins as thin as the muffled films of an international spying / thriller behavior. If this was Hartley's intentions or if it ran out of mind is not clear, but I think a bit of correction or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes into the movie would keep the original film preservation. Performance was generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, which had the most screen time. Safran Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played the role of good support. The visual film was nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without persistent. The movie is well written and I enjoyed this very much. If you like Hartley's hard work, you'll probably love this.
