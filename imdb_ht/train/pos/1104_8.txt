The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) tells a story about how his best friend - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed in a small apartment in New York, which does not have enough space closet and some toilets. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, Jim's advertising affects the love and (or falls for!) An ad for a home. Once he has bought the house, bills and frustrations stacked incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of 'Jim's dream home' goes wrong. <br /> One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a good little comedy - not much fiscal, with no big big message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Street views are right from the start, when the alarm clock goes with Jim trying to close it, only to call again at every turn by Muriel. The distribution and delivery of the comedy and situation lines can only be made by a couple of seasoned advantages, and that's just what Grant and Loy give us: polished performance, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a very ingredient role (it's obvious that Jim's character Jim gets the lion's share of the lines and acts, and Grant, as always, pulls both off and remarkably aplomb), but gives Muriel a color, life and biting that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas plays wry entertainment in perfection as well, never hit one single score score. <br /> One of my favorite scenes was definitely got when Bill gets himself close to the 'store room', and Jim goes to 'save' him ... only to get everyone blocked inside! Every little problem arising out of Blandings's renovation projects - including petty envy and an ad campaign for 'Wham' - seems to bring together everything that * could * go wrong and build a new home but make it credible with a look agreeable. 8/10
