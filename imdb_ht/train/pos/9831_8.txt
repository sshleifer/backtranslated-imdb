We have great hope with this one. . . because its Zombies are 3 end of the Official Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . however. . . Co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from the night of the zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (night of the zombies) and his shot in the Phillimines as night of the zombies and looks night to the zombies ( hell of Living Dead). as a result it is more like a companion of Hell in the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis has produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi has given its 2 magic Zombi. . . Zombi 3 is not magic. . . It's like peanut butter and frozen sandwiches without the peanut butter. But over the years, I grew up accepting Zombi 3. I swore I saw a version of a soldier biting on the arm and went to the hotel room. . . There was an absolute Fulci-cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut is the one on DVD.
