The story is very unique. It's about these 2 pilots saving Earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that does everything around them rapidly. The whole series is on the pilots to deal with the loss of time, friends, and mentors. <br /> <br /> The end came to be fantastic. It started to finish on a score scoring score and left a real brand but instead ended up on a super happy Disney score and annoyed me very badly. <br /> <The animation is decent for 89, but can not be compared with nowadays. I've also heard many complaining about cheesiness in the nudity.I actually find it to be a bit decent. There's the nudity for the most part guaranteed except in Episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> Overall it deserves a look but the finish holds it from being a classic.
