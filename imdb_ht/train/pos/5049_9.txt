I saw this gem twice really appreciate all of it. When a widow's father interprets her child's sleep with a shocking revelation, they tear between believing it, not. As the terrible events in this story unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destiny. With shocking twist after shocking twist, this film never allowed for a lull in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performance is that of his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his youngest son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best stairs that I've seen in a while, and you'll want to look this a few times to appreciate all the complicated aspects of the plot. I give this movie a 9/10.
