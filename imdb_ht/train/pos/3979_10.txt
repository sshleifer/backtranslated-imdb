I would just like all the fans of this documentary know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so darn proud of her. This mini-series that's shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on her. The amount of time and effort I've watched it put in this documentary and the book that started it all (can not find My Way home) make it the best to watch it on TV. I know he likes what he does and does it well. Her eloquence is shown in the interviews, which she made herself, and adds amazing that she added to the Next. From the video music and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture in the eyes of someone who lived in it. I appreciate any comments on this from those who have enjoyed it (or did not) and would like to hear from fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
