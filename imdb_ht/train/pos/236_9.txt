It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "Amateur Girls" is like a movie. In the old movie theater time I would have been set for more shows. Did this story be autobiographical for the writer / director? He had the aura in reality. <br /> <br /> All cast in the stars featuring the characters decently and tenderness. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I liked her work since "For Roseanna". With most movies, one ceases to believe because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to stop the beliefs of the "Girls Amati". One feels like part of this family! How I wanted to come to the defense of Dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life. And she wanted to cheer Lee Grant as her critical level in Cloris Leachman's hair color. The overall humor is not humorous laughing vantage, but rather has a feeling-good quality that meets far more than prataps and so. The love described in this family cinema is to be imitated and cared for. <br /> It's not coincidence that the family name Amati, translated from the Italians 'love people' means.
