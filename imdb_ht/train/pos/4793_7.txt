After seeing this movie I feel like I know just a bit more about the USA. David Lynch is synonymous with traumatic shock and weirdness for strange reasons, and indeed these elements are missing from the right story. However it is in a light that I have not witnessed before Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life but ends with an array of absurd and exciting ideas in life that can not be noticeable from their introduction. Especially moved to the bar scene with two WWII veterans discussed the events of fifty years ago and how it still affects their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild or Dune Wild, do not look here. But if you are looking for real people and this real story is the movie for you.
