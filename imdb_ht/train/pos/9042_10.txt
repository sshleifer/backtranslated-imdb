I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the men who founded industrial and magic lights for working on the First Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something being racking the brain for a title for the movie, "The Rocket Boys" (I guess) lacked something. <br /> <br /> One day they were messing with a PC program that formed words in other words (ie typing in a word or phrase series and mixing the letters up and forming words) I think the technical term is an "anagram" <br /> In any case, they are typed in "rocket boys" and make sure that what's coming back is "October Sky". They were shocked at least at. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolved around Sputnik. At first Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed up to her after the "poster film poster" came out and took.
