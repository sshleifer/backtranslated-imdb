This movie has nothing short of a black, fearless ruler. I can be fair, as the Apartheid epoch is an area I always felt for myself. But I'd say it's right up and call Freedom and Call Country Girl. Unfortunately to a few days ago I never heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated films ever, probably because it was a small movie company, I would never even hear of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his roles well. Do not look for humor in this movie, no. It is real, wild and bravest to the last, and tender I would say bring a box of tissue. But big movies like this do you ask, why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of?
