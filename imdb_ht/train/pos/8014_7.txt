But if you love the muppets I challenge you to this one. Basically the same regurgitated scheme (this time New York, by LA) it features a lot of fun hammocks and hi-jinx muppet. A lot of muppets are leaving the movie very early on as it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I had to enjoy it very much. Fun to watch with your kids.
