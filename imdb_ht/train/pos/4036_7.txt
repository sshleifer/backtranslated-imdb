Good luck to get this movie even look - it's not always released on tape or DVD. I saw on the release of the early '70, was lucky enough to catch it through American Cinematheque's preservation efforts, and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years. <br /> No The reason for repeating the exact commentary here is here. As a Director come-out soon after the success of soaring in five easy pieces, Jack N said they had managed to reduce the budget effort as best as possible, and it certainly shows the wandering and crowning that could be used by some re -coupe. But it's also a memorable icon for her time: all very intense clashes in late 60's college sports, student movements, sexual revolution, and more. <br /> <br /> Why do you see this movie? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes: frankly the male bonds in the after-game showers; The Karen Black scene and Tepper in the car will catch you a little keeper - but it's the first use of a word I have not witnessed in previous films; with casual and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others I have to. <br /> <br /> Look for a wonderful surprise to a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a slim David Ogend calf; Mike Warren is cool from its blue-blue blue UCLA and ready for a black-blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - actor; and a whole lot of folks simply play themselves. <br /> Now, any connection between Harry Gittes last names, Robert Towne, with a certain character in Chinatown and the two jacks? It gets a "7"-based Karen Black. You will see why.
