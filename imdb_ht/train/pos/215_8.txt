The 'classic' word is thrown around too many wounds nowadays, but this movie deserves the appeal. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best comic actor), and late George Burns to make for a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to contemplate what the movie would like there was no death to prevent Jack Benny from playing George Burns' party, as planned. As it is, the reunion scene of Matthau's apartment is not likely to be more powerful than a sidesplitter. Definitely one of my island's desert films. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
