I thought that ice age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman, with no children, I always seem to enjoy these funny comics, witty witty. South is the best character I've seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although it was really funny, and I did not think his character was able to match or even beat) and even more funny than Melman in Madagascar . I saw the film at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the party where South says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tiger" ... "Pack of wolves, pack of bears, packs of beads, packs of mustache, pack of noses, pack a dime? pack of lies, pack of trouble, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or however this party goes! This is the funniest part of the entire movie, although I really enjoyed the humor behind "sluggish on the map" and many other parts too. The only animated film that can be remotely compared to Ice Age is the "Brother Bear".
