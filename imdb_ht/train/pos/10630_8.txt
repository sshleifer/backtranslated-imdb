I think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words "Clueless and lurid nonsense." I think it is a very funny movie with excellent entertainment. One has suspended unbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman can fall in love, have a child and live together happily ever after. But it's always nice to see it played out of a movie and the heart is warm. Is it impossible? There are far more implausible events described in other movies. Actually, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that the story might well have ended when the family drives away from his first home rather than prolonged to explore whether the man retains any residual inversion.
