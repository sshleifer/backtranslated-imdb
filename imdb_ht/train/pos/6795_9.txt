One of the most intelligent killer series cinemas in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notoriously reliable killers. Creators create an unexpectedly good insights into this mysterious murderous pathology, and anyone who remembers the zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killer, Zodiac was not crazy at all but very metodic with a self-promoter. The director here plays viewer viewer and pulls it off. The movie is constructed as a murderous mystery, or a "cold case" style funny. It is an intellectual / procedure-style horror movie that will put-off gore-best in search of cheap emotions. Some people get any movie that has been shot on video. This attitude is very old-style and provincial. It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but smart-looking viewers look beyond that and get a gem very carefully.
