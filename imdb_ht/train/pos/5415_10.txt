Early Hollywood at her best !! A classic Kipling poem transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performance by a stellar cast. I think the measure of a good movie is how many times you can watch it and still enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry in the end and, admit it, you do too !!
