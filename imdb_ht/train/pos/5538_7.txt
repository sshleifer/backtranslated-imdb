A couple (Janet and Richard) goes camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple take refuge in what they think is an abandoned farm house. Soon, a pair of escape escapes show up and, after much delay in the inevitable, they continue to violate Janet and close Richard in a birdcage. <br /> <br /> This LAST HOUSE on the left movie has to be one of the most underrated manor movies ever made. It's one of the most sick and wounded early 70s shocking. In addition, I found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in her misery. I like CAGED TERROR. The music definitely helps to borrow a sense of personality in the movie as well as a lot of beauty. I found the movie to be well creepy. The defects are mostly due to the rhythm of the film, which means that the film is rather slow and sharp. While I did not mind the rhythm due to the beauty and suspense of the movie in question, I think it will be both most people. Acting is not too good nor the dialogue, at least in the early stages. This movie takes a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone. <br /> In short, this was a good movie. By the greatest supporting movie I've ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. It's not exactly the easiest movie to get. It is possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of movie theater then it's definitely worth checking out.
