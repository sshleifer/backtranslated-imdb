These slasher pics are sold by date, but this one is a great fun. The valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out. The film has only one peach in a line ... "It's not angel ...." when it's in reality is angel !!! Watching Buffy reruns will never be! <br /> Throw is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough depth. Denise Richards on DVD costs seemed to think the girls were wearing well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with the characters. I'm sorry but NO! <br /> The direction is very good, managed to show very little actual actuality, and relying on your imagination implicit threat. Many can also say for similar ways in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove the clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main directorial more lies in the "lending" of various other ideas out In flicks before slasher. The psycho show show split, along with Halloween's "massage." <br /> <br /> Kill someone a hiding in a bodybag even though it's a pretty original one as far as I know !!! <br /> <br /> Lights look, not very scary, but a few jump jumps so.If it was a choice between the hole and this though, choose the hole. Slasher movies have the days and this is just another slasher. good slasher, but nothing inaugural !!!
