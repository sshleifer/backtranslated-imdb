Faithful adaptation of novel witty and exciting novel on a cynical and depressed medium software (or something), relying on first-person narratives but there is no worse for that. Downbeat (in a petite-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and dark comic, the best way I could describe both the movie and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no CB respect intended). Mordantly funny, but also a weak analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's great success is that it reflects real-life in a way to acknowledge that you ask: why not other films like this? One of the rare examples of a good book makes an equally good movie.
