A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. It has an interesting plot to fill with familiar characters. Road Rovers are a worth seeing show, it's a 13 short episode, and if you can ever manage a chance to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think the Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD with all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they did, you should buy it too. If you have kids who love dogs, they will love road rows! Road Rovers should have gotten more attention while being unveiled, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated more than it was.
