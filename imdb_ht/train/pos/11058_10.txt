I should say that this is the first romantic-comedy quality I've ever seen. It had depth and although you knew from the beginning that was going to end together was always craving to see and anticipate. thought that maybe they will not get together ... it is an independent movie after all. This film was well written, directed and acting. The dance on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
