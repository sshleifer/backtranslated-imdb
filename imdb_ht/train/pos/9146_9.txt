This musical electronics has more than one observer of selfishness in his star, the musical genius that is Prince. This movie is 90 minutes so poses, but in truth it is easy to see why it is like a classic cult. Many other like films that center around the young struggling young musicians, this has a hint of the drama it adds a dimension to the music numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is fun not less and the band is much better. On the dramatic side of the story center things around the Kid (Prince) a young artist and regular place in a club. The owner of the club is frustrated with the kid's arrogance and little Kid knows that he could soon be shot and replaced by a rival. One side of the Kid's parents has problems, and his father abused it. During the course of the Kid's film learn a few lessons of life, and learn to appreciate her friends more. It's all we've seen in coming to play at the age of play, but this combines as a music, a highly stylized music. <br /> <br /> The cast are good. Prince is actually quite good on the side of the drama, when he does not hit a pose. It looks like people and relatable. Clarence Williams is also very good as the abusive dad too. Appollonia Kotero makes a first good like Prins love love interest. <br /> <br /> The main force in the movie however is the superb band. The music numbers are well-performing and electrified. Prince has no doubt a music maestro, albeit very unique. When it inspires it is great but on the flip side it will often make singing singles for his own taste, and sometimes his experience may be missing-fire, but that's the same for many music geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is excellent though, and only Sex was a weak point. The show-standing performance of Purple Rain is the exceptionnel though. It is one of my favorite songs ever. *** <br /> <br />
