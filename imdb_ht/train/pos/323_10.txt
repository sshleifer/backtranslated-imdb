This is truly an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground movie. There are barely opening or closing credit - we are just falling into the world of consumer art, revolution, and genes. This film has little to do with documentary and it is more interesting to play with our ideas in advertising and its relationship to reality. The real and not real lines are crossed into the familiar way of filming documentary, but this time we do it for consuming and marketing reasons, not to describe the real.
