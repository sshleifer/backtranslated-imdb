I find it very intriguous that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin, would encourage the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" subject to a movie. They can certainly be considered the "skeletons" in the closet family. The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers of some of the ideas of these oddball women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these fascinating designers. ("Are they black? Or do I miss something?"). This movie is hard to come. Netflix does not have it. Facets do, though.
