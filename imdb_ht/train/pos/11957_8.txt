Great Woody Allen? No Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found myself, along with the audience in attendance, laughing hard and often in some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard in a while. The Allen aging creates a proper role for himself as Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... well, sort of. Some said Johansson play "a young Dianne Keaton." I implore differently. She plays Woody's dialogue, which, in her comedy, still has a lot of feelings as ... like, well, a Woody Allen comedy. That's fine for us woody appreciate. She certainly made Woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Some may find Woody's tedious humor, but for those of us who love it when it does right, we look forward to the next.
