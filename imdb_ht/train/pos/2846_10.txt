I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who has seen this movie a few minutes ago .... AND I want to thank those who worked on creating this movie! It is not the best or most .... but it touches my heart ... why I would like to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible .. is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regrets about the time wasting on watching it! It is about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but we miss it sometimes because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have but miss it. ... why a fu * k we do that ??? We need to live as they died ... care about every second and remember: if we do good things-good things come back to us! .and it has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistake (English is my second language) ...
