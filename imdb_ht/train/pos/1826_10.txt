I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17 it is one of the most favorite animated films. Beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things love about this movie. Although many people can not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well done and go along with the story. It focuses on Charlie, a handsome German Shepard servant who may seem unbalanced in some of the first ... but eventually will win you over. <br /> Not a kiddie movie by any means. Often very dark and scary at times. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animators amateurs. But keep a tissue in handy. ADGTH never fails to cry and will do the same for sensitive movie people. Fortunately one of the largest non-Disney animated films of all time. Together with Watership Down and my neighbors Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece in the sky.
