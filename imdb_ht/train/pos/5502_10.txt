Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of Media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good a Chavez person is. It is really to demonstrate how the Bolivarian sees how it happened, the way Chavez saw it. Although it may seem wrong and bias to support a movie, I think the point of view shown in the film is completely legitimate. The Venezuelan people across the private media society in Venezuela only saw a side view of the coup, the neo-liberal side. This movie shows us how Bolivarians have seen it. Call it propaganda, I say it is a trial appeal on your part.
