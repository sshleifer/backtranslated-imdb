If your mind in a suspense is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people have been down under gun, then "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you. If you love and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then by all means, see it. <br /> <br /> The House of Games tells the story of an estimated psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) Mike's charismatics (Joe Mantegna). To say more about the plot would ruin the suspense. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they see twist coming. Just like an intelligent art artist, this film draws you to its internet with your vigilance. The story is stiff and well-crafted, the intelligent and laconic dialogue, the act is just fine (Mantegna is superbly charisma). Some have suggested that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wonder why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; In addition, its western is in an essential way in the draw (at one point, I believe that an accident in her sexual self esteem is an important part of her motivation ... I will say no more). <br /> "House of Games" is a black look at the cost of human nature that ends on a note of discomfort ambiguity. It will keep your attention every second while you look, and stay with you for a while later.
