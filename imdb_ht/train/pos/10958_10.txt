This show is so incredibly hilarious that I could not stop watching the marathon on Central Comedy tonight (despite the fact that I've seen all the episodes already). I've always considered Silverman as a great talent and this is ultimately a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience. I watch this show and I laugh a very big percentage of the time ... I can not say that on TV shows much ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting with (most important) funny! This is a show I will never miss and it is one I'll buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. You must read to yourself to watch this show ... I predict a long run for this series ... And just to be clear, the people who are offended at this show just do not get it ... maybe They lack intelligence to understand it ... they should stop fooling themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the term "bigot" in the Silverman reference, or claims that he only aims to "hit" is the way in the mark ... It's exactly the opposite; just Google it and you will quickly see that it is a great opponent of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that it's ironically embracing all those outrageous opinions, you do not get it. But if you do not find it, make the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
