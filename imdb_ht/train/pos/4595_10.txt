Jackie Chan is the name synonymus about the cascade. This movie never leaves you down.The opening of Chase's most scenic stages and rolling down the scene at the stake is so riskier than one wonder if it knows the meaning of fear. This movie comes very close to Jackie's best project. But the main difference being that the project has three stars where in this film Jackie brings the film entirely to his shoulders. This is perhaps the reason The main feature of this movie was to make Jackie a bigger star star star followed by Bruce Lee. The film has pretty nice touch too. What makes this movie work is Jakie's ability to show her revered side that's in contrast to the hero's hero's hero's art action. This film was followed by a good but handsome ending in comparison with its predecessor.
