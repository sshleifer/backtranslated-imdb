This low-budget erotic thriller has some good points, but a lot more bad one. The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear his lover who accused of killing his wife. Being a soft-core film, including her going to infiltrate a strip club and having sex with possible suspicions. As scheme goes for this kind of genre, not bad. The script is okay, and the story makes sense enough for someone up to 2 AM watching this not notice much draws. But everything else in the movie looks cheap. The lead actors are not that bad, but pretty much all they are unbelievably bad (a girl seems like it's drunk and / or high). The cinema is badly lit, and everything is pear and ugly. The sound is so awful that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this film is the reason you're watching it-sex. The reasons why people look things are for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in Red Shoe Reds situation. The sex scenes are not hot they're cracked, injections in that porn style where everything is just a master shot of two people going to it. The woman also seems to be refuge from a pornographic shoot. I do not try to be rude or mean here, but they all have breast implants and an outdoor burn / weather look. The same title, "Deviant Obsession", sounds like a hardcore flick. Not that I have nothing against pornography - in fact I love it. But I want my soft-core and hard-core divisions. What has ever happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who might act with who would totally excite you? And what happens to B erotic eroticism such as Body Chemistry, naked and even deciphered to kill. Be sure, none of those chiefs, but at least they felt like movies. Plus, the envelope was pushed, going beyond Hollywood's relatively prideful position on sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. Now they just make hard-core movies without having the hard-core sex.
