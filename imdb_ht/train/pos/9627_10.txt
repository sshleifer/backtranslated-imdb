This is by far the funniest short performed by the two funny geniuses. From the time to walk in, Hardy's time just falls off the roof, this keeps me laughing irritatedly. I highly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. I also recommend the whole series of the Holy Spirit. If you are looking for laugh, watch this movie, and you'll be happy.
