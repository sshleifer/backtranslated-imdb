The 'Luzhin Defense' is a good film and great performance, but too much of the novel and not enough in the cinema cinema shining. He felt in most of the movie that the characters just helped to push the narrative together. Marlene Gorris could possibly have examined Psyche Luzhin, rather than show him as an innocent tortured victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go enough enough in the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's rift and her mother come across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashlight in the movie. I felt that I was wearing the Luzhin torman and the final tragic end, without giving the pleasure of having its unusual personality and complexity unraveled. However, this was a moving and enjoyable movie but certainly not a big one.
