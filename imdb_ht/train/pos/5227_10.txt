The "Male" movie is definitely one of the funniest, if not funny comic movies, I've ever looked! (and I look very well!) It's about two garbage, who gets the "White Men" and then suspended an invasion of space. It is also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that this movie is wrong has something wrong with itself. There are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you might actually get wounds in your mouth from laughing too hard (it comes to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly will not regret it!
