If you like the 70's sci-fi cult way, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" than you love this one. It's a stream of 70's sci-fi sci-fi consciousness, including a 22 Junkyard century and the Earth a million years from now. This film is the best 70's. Put on Steve Miller to "Fly Like an Eagle" or the Pink Floyd "Dark Side Of The Moon" and you're ready to go!
