It should be against the law by experimenting this very funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like it. Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes on dicks, pussy, tits and insects many famous ones including his own "family". Among those who find it by murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've seriously never laughed so hard at anything all my life. I mean, when someone does not know who Mr. T is, but still laughs at Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. At the time I saw the show I could not remember that Mr T. was but still laughing. Now I know who he is and who just does it much more funny. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make those impression so good that it does not matter what the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. And on top of that, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please watch it ..
