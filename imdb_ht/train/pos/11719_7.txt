Elvira, Mistress in the Dark, is a fun, comedy horror comedy, in which the fourth wall broke a couple of times and jokes often stay below the navel. But the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is stacking ostrich show hostess, who learns, that he inherited his aunt Morgana. So he goes to a small town in Fallwell, led by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: Morality Committee. Elviras boobacious appearance is, of course, too much for the prunes, but the city's kids get a kick from different types of approaches on life. And of course there are even more disasters, Vincent Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who after Elvira's book of spells. Look, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know it. But for what it is, Elvira is quite funny movie, though the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most laugh out of the difference between Elvira and the people of good moral, but there are a couple of good visual gaps as well. Over all directions is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. In all, a good, intentionally camping, comedy. If you love this kind of thing, that's what.
