I received the first Bill and Ted Movie for Christmas and I had to get the second when I saw it in a store. This one was (I think) just as funny as the first, but a sweetest story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they played death. The funny thing was that they played it in stupid little games like signs. The only thing I would change is Station and Death were in the band but other than it was great.
