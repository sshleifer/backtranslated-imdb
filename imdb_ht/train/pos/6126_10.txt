I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4.00 in my local store and I thought it looks very good for a low budget film so I bought it and I was good it was good. For starters this movie is about a killer snowman so that something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The act was okay with the Jack Frost line told me laughing "I just axed you for a smoke" and "the world most pure edged in Snow Cone" how funny and camping is so? The story at the beginning was very funny and funny too "Jack must be nimble, Jack must be quick, Jack eyed and candle sticks". If you're looking for one for a B-movie comedy movie that's all puns then check out Jack Frost out. 10/10
