I think this is a beautiful family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and driver-heating moments to be had in the movie. The actors are great and the effects are well executed at all. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the baseball team "The Angels" and is great in the movie. Also fantastic are the young actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd are good as the Angel and their effects are great in this film film Disney movie. A touch and hearty movie that everyone should enjoy.
