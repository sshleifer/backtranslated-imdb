I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> I did not watch his other movie. They came and went. But Page-3 is nicely done. It seems real. Like Satya from RGV did. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called high society is summarized in the movie. Among all the diseases, its difficulty is a normal life that the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious films, do not have to watch with the kids or wait for the wife. Page-3 in newspapers is the usual place for reporting activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who appreciate in many more fluid then what's reported. How This Page-3 is also a business prospect shown in the movie. Event management companies are paying to arrange for parties and make a rich person, but not famous overnight by clicking pictures and celebrities are invited to the party. Western culture was deeply rooted in the high society of Mumabi quite deeply. The movie shows it boldly, is not forbidden. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new journey from here.
