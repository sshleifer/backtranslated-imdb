What a great gem this is. It's a strange story that's fun to watch. Yes, he sings, but it is very nicely fabricated in the story and is very tune to hearing. It was so nice to look; I enjoyed it at start to finish! The movie takes place in England during the Second World War. It's about an apprentice witch who is looking for a missing portion of a spell that he needs. She uses her "magic" roughness to transport her to 3 children under her care at various destinations to find her. Together with her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from her school actually work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a little late at first, once you get used to becoming a part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the music songs. Characters are pretty interesting to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something to love about this movie.
