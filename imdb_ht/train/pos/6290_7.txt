Using Buster Keaton at sunset in his career was an interesting choice. It may have been the most talented comedy of the age in silence. This gives him a chance to show those talents in a little time travel story. She gets hooked with a guy living in modern times, and it becomes evident that we are best left in our own times Keaton is able to make gag sight very well. I heard her voice first. I believe he has done some of these movie party films, playing some vacuous characters just getting a few bucks. Serling seemed to respect her, and described her in this way. It's not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we hope for something we do not have and get what they want.
