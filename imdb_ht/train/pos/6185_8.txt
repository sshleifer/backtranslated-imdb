I just saw MURDER in the vanities of the newly released-Universal Pre-Code series, and I was amazed at how much I loved the end of the car. Most of the other commentators have covered the story, a murderous mystery of a music, but I wanted to add a few additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland, compared to even most of the minor players, and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for those singing (Carlisle being a singer opera singer, Brisson somewhat wobbly on some in its high and low notes). Major Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well in each other, with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between music numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities Girls but do not forget to forget the jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" number. Gail Patrick does one of his early appearances, sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there is Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe's mistress - you'll also spot him at David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and the DICK BANK. The music is very good - Brisson introduced the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet marijuana" with little clipped girl button peyote in the background (bloody chlorine skin was nice cottage); The "Ebony Rhapsody", with the Duke Ellington orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixed it up. And I believe this is one of the only musical earings to present as a mix - and the costumes leave nothing in the imagination.
