MULHOLLAND DRIVE has made David Lynch's definitive fan. It's a modern genius, because it's not just a movie-maker. Its history and style have a spell that crosses the screen. So, the LA RACE story was quite a surprise to me, and its easy to follow scenarios and sunscreen devices. Still, Lynch is there and, while this is far from her best, it's a movie not to be missed. Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. <br /> 8/10
