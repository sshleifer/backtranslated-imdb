I arrived on "showers" in the foreign movie section in my local video store and spent it several times since its cover it looked like a farce or comedy. I then lucked in a copy to buy at economically economical and happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three boys, a father and two adult sons, each coming to terms with life change as the world around will continue to change in modern China. Like many "foreign" films, the Chinese culture itself is one of the most exciting aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> Beyond the fascinating features of the site, Chinese color gives the environment in this story, is difficult again to touch the relationship between men and a single woman involved in the story, all set against the canvas in a village basin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Added to the main story is the many small characters, bathing clients, and individual conflicts with friends. "Shower" is a single movie walk away from smiling and touched by its heat and humanity.
