The only reason I've seen this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I had a break since 9th, was his first year on SNL. I'm a fan of my dying Yankees, and I did not get the painful movie until the last 15 minutes, when they start showing clips in the ALCS toys. I had to cover my ears and make a tiny noise so I should not hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it was completely squeezed. <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and original, and he is a nervous and original guy. I know that it may not be an Academy Award-winning stretch, but the film is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had better camera cameras than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this movie are stupid?) What do you think? Say I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thanksgiving thanks to taxi being able to kill him. I think Smoking films will help him out a lot. Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he's just starting out of cinemas. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.) you will see that they have started off in some flops. Buddies Busom? Australian soap opera? Here's who wants Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted her to let SNL, but what can you do?
