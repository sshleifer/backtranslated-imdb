This movie star Emily Watson, in Breaking Waves are fame. This film on one man's mania takes place in a resort where a chess competition was held. A chess meter came and shortly after fell in love (at first sight) and a woman, played by Emily Watson. It falls for this oddball of a man, who is obsessed with failure. This is all at the dismay of his mother, who is far more interested in seeing him and another young man; a proper gentleman. Her mom feels that this is just a fancy passion for the young woman, as she has a tendency to take in odd creatures with these. What indicates is especially a trip to the man's psyche. He tells the story of how he was tied up with his presence. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character. It is definitely slowing, but is well worth the look. The finish was even satisfied. :)
