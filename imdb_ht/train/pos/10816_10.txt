No, this is not supposed to be a high budget bridging, but it is brilliant in its own right. You have to look at it for what it is, a low budget chief involving a zombie violence that has a 12-inch stick that keeps out flapping in stride. Those who came to this movie a low review were probably looking for the next classical class or hide "gem" as they say and just did not quite get there. I love how everybody points out obvious observations like "baby at 5 inch attached to a fish stool" hahaha, well, yes. I do not think a movie that has a budget like this could pay "good" actors or effects to work and what they have. The bowels and gears were actually very convincing. The movie was a bit choppy going out of sequence in sequences but in general, this is one of the best movies I've seen recently that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
