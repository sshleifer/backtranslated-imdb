While in a plane, flicking in the great choice of movies, I've come across Live! almost accidentally. oh boy! What a choice. <br /> I remember vaguely seeing the trailer about a year ago and completely forgotten about it hoping no more than another movie movie nonsense on a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this was a hell of a ride. I do not remember last time I was so excited, terrified. Not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my sense, but the suspense grew steadily in the movie until reached a climax where you can not turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the corner of your seat and biting the nails you 'Received. <br /> You will first go on a moral evaluation in which you stand on the justice of the show. You will start thinking of "how come the person may be vicious" to "why not after all?" Ask yourself if you do it. Then learn about the competitors, their motives and start guessing. You will then watch competitors pulling trigger in one by one and get excited even if you know the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good act, good direct, and a movie experience that reminds you of those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next stage but still been craving for more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * couple of things I would change: <br /> <br /> - Distribution of competitors. I was really moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, he felt like you did not care about some of the competitors. Although this can be done on purpose, I think the audience should be able to partner with the majority of the competitors. - Game rules, a big glitch: <br /> <br /> What happens if the 5th competitors do not die when pulling the trigger. Do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself !!! They should give a chance to all competitors to live, ie if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was not bothered too much by this cause of my wrong cause really had a good time. just wish I had some popcorn with me!
