I hate the first episode of this show ('Hippie Protection') so much in 1999 that I shunned the rest. However, when it comes to the 'Paramount Comedy Channel' I watch it in full, and, my surprise, found it absolutely hilarious (Device: Never judge a comedy series in its first week)! <br /> Set in 1969, Simon Pegg's 'Hippies' star as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of an 'Oz' magazine that is like 'calling' Mouth. Her friends are Jill's feminist, put-back Alex, and Hugo's half-eight. Back to the end of the '60, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people, that they were able to change the world of printing in her nobody's magazine. Instead of sneering at the hippie naivety, 'Hippies' is affectionate for him. Arthur Mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of icons of this era - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'Graduate', even sadness' Oz 'obscenity trial in the' early 70 '. Excellent performance from the cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' strangely put me in mind at Richard O'Sullivan character of 'Man on the House'. It's a shame that there was never a second set, possibly because of people like me. If you miss 'Hippies', give it a try. Once you get past the box yourself, you are in for a treat!
