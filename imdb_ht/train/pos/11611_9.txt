Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of his father. As it will later reveal, both of his parents have died in tuberculosis. In this desperate situation Ryus Aunt arranged a wedding with a Japanese man in Hawai, whom they know only in his photographs. When they arrive at Hawai ryu discover that her new husband is older as in the picture, and that he lives in very modest circumstances around a plant cane plant he's been working on. Ryu does not use the hard work on the plantation and in despair on her situation in her new home thinking to run away. She soon discovered that she has nowhere to go. The friendship of Kana, a female co-worker in her money, gives her hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America, whom they only knew in the pictures. This is not very well-known photographs well written and acting. The place is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very latest screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film provides some insight into Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see!
