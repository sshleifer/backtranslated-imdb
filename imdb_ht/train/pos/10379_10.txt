Running The Platoon is a movie movie b and Gary Busey.it is a fairly unfiltered movie for one I've seen it in a car boot I thought this looks amusing I was right. Gary Busey plays a smith tray a hard mercenary framed for the murder of a powerful Cuban crime crimes right now on running the tray must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (skarface) and star action Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what I like about running the plateau was the way the movie never got boring the plot could do before but it was still good to act was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well specifically the climate Gary Busey did Heroic good heroes since she normally plays the bad guy with Steve Bauer is as good sidekick the same platoon Jeff Speaksman performs a good performance and he can not even properly finish it in running the Platon is an enjoyable effort of films now and I give Read 7 out of 10
