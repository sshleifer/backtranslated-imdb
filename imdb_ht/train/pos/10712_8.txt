This film best describes or compared to "Big Fish" (film by Tim Burton). But it is a less celebrity and the more you face history. And of course here is not the father, but his grandfather tells their stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative film moves back and forth (so the story story here at IMDb, might tell you more than you'd like it before you watch the movie). It's funny and engaging enough, even if you get out of one story to another and have some dramatic moments too. It also surprises you here and there, and things you would not expect. A nice little movie then, who deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : o)
