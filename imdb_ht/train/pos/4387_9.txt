This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple it is pure and straightforward. In truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes to conflict with those who are more educated and rich in the period. Poor vs rich, honorable vs. humorous, a classic but well-told story without much of the glitz in Hollywood stinking up the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> :)
