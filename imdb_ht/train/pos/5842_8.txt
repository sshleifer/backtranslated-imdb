Can I be as simple and primitive in my assessment as simply saying "I love it"? It's reasonably funny by bits, it's got great stars and it's gorgeous look. The songs (there are about then repeating) are forgettable, but they find a healthy ironic treatment (like Mr Fairbanks's very beautiful guys explode in version versions of Venus's Miss Grable castles were just rendering); There are not many dancing and all 1861 crinolines are wrapped around Miss Grable, and the comedy might be a bit heavy but the result is still very much expanding. The photography (including real outdoors that is a thrill) is amazing, playing around with different shades of heavy gold heavy. Miss Grable is a bit past his prime, and on the fluff side, but still fresh and comfortable in this comedy "OLD world" comedy. It's pretty much along the line of "down on Earth" and Rita Hayworth, and that one tends to be rather not very much. So, I suppose many people would consider "That Lady of Ermine" to be outdated and blind. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move together in a certain manner anyhow. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, costumes, witty scripts and anything else that movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with both German and English bands.
