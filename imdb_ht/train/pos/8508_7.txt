Richard Dix decided to retire and thus Michael Duane took his place playing the role as Ted Nichols who met up with a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barclays, (Lenore Aubert). This couple knew each other for two days and decided to get married to a Peace Justice (Judge) and poured rain when they pulled up the Judge's house and found out that he was not home and would not return until day next. As the couple are indoors you see some people lifting the top of the cars and taking a part of the vehicle from the engine. Once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a great surprise and story story revealing a very mysterious event surrounding Alice Barclays and so poor Ted Nichols starts out with many problems and there is no marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
