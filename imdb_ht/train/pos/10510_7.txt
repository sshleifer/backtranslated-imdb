This is an OK adapter, but not as good as the TV version. Actors are generally well but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK with its English accent is very good, but again, I prefer Emma Kate Beckinsale. There has been excellent support performance from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. The script is often played too much for laughing, the book is a comedy, but there are too many series gags here, and Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the landscape. It is far too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do it like this. Despite these critics I enjoyed this movie, but would recommend the TV more adaptation.
