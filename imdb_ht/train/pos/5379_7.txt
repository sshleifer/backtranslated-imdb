There's a lot to attend college girls Murders. An angry scientist creates an almost detectable gas poison. Before it can reap the rewards of discovery, the scientist is killed by a hood, whisk-hooded monk. After a co-ed dead in a church by the gas, Scotland Yard calls for investigation, but the kill continues. Who can stop this angry assassin who seems to be able to come and go as he wants to and from the college? <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The killer. What does not like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vibrant red KKK fitted, fitted with red gloves. The whip whip it carries and used very effectively to say out nicely against the bright red gown. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a red flame, pointy-tipped outfit around a girl's school is fairly far-fetched, it's one of the more disaster costumes I've seen. <br /> <br /> 60s Groovy Music. I really want to track down the music title to kill college girls. She has a jazzy, hip, 60s feels that I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Touch touch. Beyond the red gown and the killer, the film features a sliding fireplace, an algae hole with a cage on top, poisonous swing bibles, a slat jacket set, mini-skirts, go-go boots, and high hair hair. I would describe it as a cross between the TV's 60s TV shows and an Italian giallo. The college girls Murders are a real treat for the eye. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's say that there is more twist than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer has discovered, here comes a twist ?? .. and another .. and another ?? and another. <br /> What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief inspector Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be funny rescue, but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time. <br /> - Why Are Alligators? Previously, I mentioned the alleys in the pit. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through the problem and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Draw. Some of the college girls Murders have no sink or rhythm on it. There are too many moments in the movie when things come inexplicably in a skilled halt. Best rhythms would make this a more enjoyable movie. <br /> I have not seen many of these German crimes, but in some of I've seen (Phantom of Soo, Strangler at Blackmoor Castle, Eyes Dead in London) this might be my favorite. This one has a real funky feeling that I really got into. The plot has shed a little better, I could easily give The College Girl Murders a 7/10.
