I do not give a movie or ten shows very often but this show touches a nerve in a way no other shows. I found the whole set on mysoju.com and think the site looked interesting so I took a look to see. I was not ashamed of what I saw; I moved. This story remains on the sensitive side as the main characters move us to the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played reflective by Koyuki, shows us human nature as he wants to keep the problem being shown. No one really wants to put their souls out in front of a joint perspective. So, instead of replacing a human, played by an adore Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This animal like any other animal we would consider a pet. Difference; It can be retaliated in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. As it is treated like a pet, it reacts to situations that a dog can react. She spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo becomes jealous. It's time to realize that her pet is not just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to grow thick - Momo is a dance prodigy. Thinking it slowly changed as we start to find a glance at his own thinking. Matsumoto takes you out to see a character that is one dimension from the beginning, in two dimensions when we see it is a dancer, in a three-dimensional character when we see him starting to fall for his master as a man, not like a dog. In my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo and these tenderness you almost begin to wish you had one too. Nor wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name gives him as one would name the new puppy) state ?? We both knew this could not last. See this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
