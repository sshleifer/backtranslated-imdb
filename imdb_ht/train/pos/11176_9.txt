Ok, the first time I got to point out the fact that when I first saw this flick my movie was 9 years old. If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time, I'd probably noted that this is just another newly-made movie-cable TV movie and some well-performing scenes. But when you are nine you just do not care about these facts. This scary hell comes from me back then especially those aforementioned Zelda-scene (and still do). Nowadays I'm kind of tuned to this movie. I must see that maybe once a month, and about every year the new year I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends. It's such an appetizer for a good party! I like to agree with those who said that the act here is pretty unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like, but one can not see much devotion or feelings about their faces in those two. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes that the "Creeds" underact. What I actually mean about this is the fact that there is really no other movie that has any sort of Pet Sematary similarity, and I do not mean the zombie stuff here. ATMOSPHERE FILM This is a new one and one in a child. Honestly, how many times did you see a movie on superficial levels looks like one cable-one, but leaving you with a frost compared to just the best-horror outdoors? Well, I busted some of the throw away a minute ago, but I must say that all pieces of this level too much ego act in perfection. But hey tells me if you really know some films that are similar to Pet Sematary! I really want to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead here ... this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to things.
