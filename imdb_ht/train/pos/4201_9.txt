Pickuped on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller Maverick, has a stunning opening that establishes a double complication. Subway Jumper Candy (Susan Peters) collided with pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in shiny cool color). It is not ignored that it brings valuable microfilaments; McCoy is unaware of grifting her. Both are ignored by two observed by two federal agents. So the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges. Candy is doubly watched (Jumping with the police) and therefore doubly naive; Jumping, the non-compulsive thief, is something that is unclear, secured by federal agents; Feds, all know, are finally discouraged. They can not stop "passing" in government secrets or spread the communist.
