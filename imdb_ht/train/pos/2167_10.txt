I saw this film back in 1984, we first started watching "This is Spinal Tape" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to seeing this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory going around in mind, you'll want to look this one. <br /> <br /> The question you must ask yourself when you watch this movie is: do you think the government could do that? (In my opinion I have no doubt being able to) <br /> But I do not want to give out too much information like this would be a spoiler and I think you should see the movie for yourself. But just let you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do.
