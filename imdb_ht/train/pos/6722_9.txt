Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good big), the personality (greater than life), the structure (chronological, and many references to sailing culture in time). What is missing is a major issue of sociological importance: chucking mainstream American culture for something more satisfying and rewarding. <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We've watched 16mm film in local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin warms heat, put on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and go to watch the latest surf movie at night. Often, the narrator has the movie itself, read a script on paper sheets. Sometimes, a surf sound or band-to-punk band might add music. I was never happier. Except for the capture and hollering, seeing 'Riding Giants' took me back in time. <br /> It also boosts a living sentiment on the edge, not worrying about the money and climbing the social and corporate ladder, by keeping up with the Joneses, pushing you physically and mentally for a flirtive moment in joy and rejoicing - can be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" At least for people like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that some of us are bold enough or honest and ourselves enough to pursue: living only life on our own terms. Maybe society can fall if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who actually live their dreams. <br /> It was this message that impressed me.
