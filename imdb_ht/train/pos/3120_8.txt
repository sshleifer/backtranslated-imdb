Paul Greengrass definitely rescues the best Bourne for the last! I heard a lot of people complaining about how he filmed this movie, and some even compared the camera style to the Witch Witch Project. All I have to say is that ... are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the scene actions to feel more realistic, which I would prefer on highly stylized cascade choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon really got along with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in that case it's something really good. He really gets Jason Bourne at this steak. Damon also had a great cast of support to Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret organization CIA. Though the film is full of great chases and unmanaged actions, they manage to stick a fair amount of character's development and all that goes on. This movie stands far above the other Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies in the summer of 2007!
