I do not look sooo. My grandmother always watches one with the mirror hour. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. I found the story pretty humorous. The mods of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just head off. The big hair, the heels are high, and the histrionics - what a combination. With all the actors just going to town, chewing up parties and spitting them out of a great scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - Wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids. And Garry: why we had to wait long to see him on film? Leesa Gibbons - did not miss her, but nice to include it as a real-life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for that job, anyway?). Admittedly, I could do without Sally climbing the drainage. Lucy Ricardo has done it, how many times, as there are all comedians from Carol Burnett I do not know who and I so do with it now, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently it's what you do when you're funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful they did not pull out the flagle bit. <br /> But it was nice, it was funny, having twisted draw, having a credit after finishing before it was common, having clothes worthy for a second glance, having a big throw it and receive personal memories for me. Really, what more do you need?
