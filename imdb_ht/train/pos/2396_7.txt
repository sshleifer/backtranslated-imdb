This is a very entertaining film that follows the rehearsal process of a NY production in Macbeth. Although it has a lot to say about the power, jealousy and ambition (the terms of Macbeth) in our modern world, the movie works best when it does not take itself too seriously. Known actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury perform great work in the main roles, but record for me was the hilarious scene where the "murder" of Banquo (John Elsen) is repeated. Probably a more fun movie for people involved in theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
