This is a gem of a movie not only for people who love fun and original local but who love the history and tradition of sci-fi and classic Hollywood movies. Every stranger in the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic Sci-Fi character or member of Hollywood royalty and it's the best fun look bite to each other with the residents of Big Bean.
