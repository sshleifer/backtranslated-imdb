This was a very good movie. I did not go to it with very high expectations and were pleasantly surprised by the acting, script, and the scenery. Miranda Richardson was fantastic and so was Joan Plowright. They stole the show. But the other actors played the beautiful parties too. Very enjoyable movie.
