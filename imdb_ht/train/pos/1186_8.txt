A lot of talk made about "psychological Westerns", but this is one of the very few who is really in that genre. It has great name stars that does very well, but it is the director who does this as a good movie. Stewart Granger lost his British safari hunter to play a huggard hunter Buffalo retired who revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the start (unlike the beginning of the usual teen, Taylor's character is middle-aged, too), who wants to kill Buffalo, and attracts Granger in business with him. They hired two other great actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, in their skinners. Granger is haunted by Buffalo's murder, knowing that he can blame if they are missing, knowing that they are gone, the American Indian way of life suffers a lot. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic realism, unlike the one-dimensional soloism of modern films, created by nerds and dorks. It is insecure, and it needs human companies. Still, it will not stop at murder. End of two holes against each other, and a thrilling conclusion. These psychological effects are well represented.
