"Tintin and I" first of all hit me as a masterpiece documentary. The photo and correction are really breath-taking (almost anti-dogma). We follow the life of Tintin Drawer drawer through an open-hearted interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn over the background of the great ideological battles of the twentieth century. Among these Hergé have its own evil spirits in battle, and many of his cartoon activities seem like a tame attempt and they are saved in a world of perfection. Though there is spectacular panorama photography of drawings from Tintin's albums and also some replenishment and reading of passages from their albums, the story of Hergé is said entirely in interviews with archival materials, and never replenished. Hergé lived the turbulent life of a real, painless artist. But the fantastic world that came to his imagination will continue to be surprising readers again and again.
