It was only about my second look, years later, that I achieved two things on this movie: 1) I enjoyed it extreme, and 2) that because its execution is definitely completely over the bid itself . I laughed out my way into the movie before it came to my renewal of my initial manifestations - valleyspeak and loogies and sighs (even * good * - natural relief) just not naturally funny, especially when sketching out of characteristic lengths. Even though the film's momentum begins to wrap out towards end, Reeves and Winter with Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) shows such a remarkable sense of distributing comics at all that even the worst-scripted jokes (t refuses to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) work as effortless as the Witter (eg challenge). With winter equipment and Reeves clicks as well as the assortment of Bill and Ted (who spend only one separate stage in the movie, disasters if they are not properly matched) appear completely skeptical. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Amazing fun fun.
