I love the series! Many of the stereotypes show Southerrners as Hicks are very noticeable, but these people exist too often. The South African portraits are all too true, but the sympathetic characters remember one of the many good things on the South as well. There are some things that never change, and we see the "good boys are old" everyday! There is a Lucas Buck in every South city that only has a phone call to make things happen, and the history of the book "White Garbage" is all too familiar. Aside from the supernatural elements, everything else can be very well to the modern South! I somehow think Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
