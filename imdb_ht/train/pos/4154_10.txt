This was one of the best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back to '68. A convict killed in the state penitentiary revealed that he stole a heroic block from the car after the shooting. This case is revealed with the assumption that it has been corrupted as a policeman. <br /> <br /> More investigation into it as a police officer and someone to reveal a war veteran who is involved in a prohibited love. This type of love was considered ashamed and something at least kept hidden at that time. <br /> While this is not what kind of love I personally support, it was always a policeman and a human and shouldn killed for it. The sound track was excellent (keep me watching the DVR), with the selective use of black and white mixed with colors emphasizing one object or giving a particular sentiment to a scene was especially appealing. I'll look this one to repeat!
