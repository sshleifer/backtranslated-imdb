I was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television. They were raised in Texas, I understand the boredom & monotony of genetic life there. This film touches my impressionable youth heart and I remembered it lovingly in the past 12 years. I recently found it for the 2nd, 3rd & 4th LOVE LOVE channel. I still cry because the film reaches & touches my interior teens.
