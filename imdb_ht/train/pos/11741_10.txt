This tender very well crafted production delved deep bitter sweetness into being. The irreverent students, life bus drivers and teacher faculty feature a subliminal debate as the story unfolds. Adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus drivers, each one of the convincing and well-known views. When a key incident occurs at the bus we send you a circle of views. All the little time of young energy is only kept under control by the organizers of the trip. Mr Harvey is making a lot of pain at all. He reminds me of damaged war teachers I did not understand when I was a student of irreverence. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and producers deserve great reputation for this well-bred British film. The wrong defect, the appropriate scene, it would be hugely available yet does not seem to have provided the right opportunity.
