For me, the final stage, in which Harris responded to the press body, is worthy to look at this clever and timeless work of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real life" police would respond in intelligent, articulate manner to Mr Harris, then the arrogants, the members serving in the press would probably think twice before the petroleum surface, "garbage" confrontation There is absolutely nothing to do with a candidate's ability to effectively handle office challenges for which he / she is pursuing.
