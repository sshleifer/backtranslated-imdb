Somewhat slow (somehow like a movie Sofia Coppola) but still a very captivating movie about the discovery of sexuality by three young girls. The magic of the movie lies in its ability to bring back many memories of how it feels to be the age. The confusion and insecurity are described in a very simple way, but so true in life. The music is perfect and the act is amazing. The camera works very well. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through this period. So many movies are made about adolescence but that really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexity.
