This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at first but the movie got the best and best for every minute. <br /> It is perhaps not for the action seeking audience but for those who love an explicit portrait of a very strange criminals, people, lover and husband. If you're not a fan of bad language or this sexual content really is not for you. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a bit hard to follow sometimes, but in the end I think he did everything better. The finish was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it might end up otherwise. <br /> As for the act I think it was good. It will not go up for an Oscar award for but it at least keeps my eye. Gil Bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very fun. Shaun Parkes Bellows Prison Marriages Clinic is huge and very powerful. On the downside I think I will put Esai Morales portrait of Markie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or its flu!
