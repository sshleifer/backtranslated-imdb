"Batman: The Mystery Of The Batwoman" is about as fun as animated Batman movies to get. <br /> While still the real feeling of the comic books, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks very much like he had before, but now he looks somewhat less imposed. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by less crazy Tim Drake Robin's juvenile. Kevin Conroy, as usual, invokes the voice of Batman much better than active actors. /> Kelly Ripa has made a much more decent voice-acting job than I expected. <br /> As in films Batman action film, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of bandits. My favorite all time, the penguin, is here. His design is sleeker than he appeared before, costing more of Meredith's paintings in the '60 than Danny DeVito painted in "Batman Back." David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. The penguin is finally described as a sophisticated cunning, as it most often appears in comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a more memorable ban than the forgettable version of "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a descent of mystery to settle, putting "Detective" back to "Funny Detective" (that's what "DC" means, after all.) The revolution of the mystery is a delightful twist twist. > <br /> The note adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie. It sounds like a mix between notes from "Poirot" and notes from "Mission: Impossible." All in all, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
