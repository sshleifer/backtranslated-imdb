I have not seen many German comedy, but if this film is nothing to go through, I have to see more! The scenario but effective scenario takes two very different people to a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovering that her husband's husband has an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything further, but that result is a very funny series of events and the perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this movie. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of the kids crazy you to think it is a family movie) who loves comedy - even those familiar with the language.
