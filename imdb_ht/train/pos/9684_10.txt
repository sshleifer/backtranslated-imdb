This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the eyes of the viewers, directing this wonderful picture of life in the heart of Paulie's heart. We have discovered from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors such as John, that even small animals like Paulie have a heart. I just could not stop tears from my eyes, even if the movie has a happy ending. This is great, after thousands of films I've seen in my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second picture that really turned me upside down.
