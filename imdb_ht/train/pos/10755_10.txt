Great documentary about the lives of firefighters NY during the worst terrorist attack of all time .. That's the reason why this would be a must see collectors items .. What shock me was not just the attacks, but "diet fat "and physical appearance in some of these firefighters. I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that, in the physical form they were in, some of these firefighters PA did not make it to the 79th floor to bring more than 60 pounds of gear. Having said that I now have a bigger respect for firefighters and I realize becoming a firefighter is a life changing job. The French has a history of doing great documentary and that's what, a great documentary .....
