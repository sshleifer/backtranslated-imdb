A strong pilot, this two-hour episode makes an excellent job of setting up the characters and backgrounds for "Enterprise," the "prequel" of the original "Star Trek" series. It stumbles a few times in conventional "trek" with cliche - candy-colored space disasters never seems to go out of style, and I can already predict snickering references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well drawn, and one can already see the suggestion that this crew in particular will have more resources, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula hit the right note as a commander and Kirk's brashness and daring, but without his vanity and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in the series will be introduced to the engineer, master weapon and communications officer ( Not only a smartphone operator yet!) as players support. The writers seem to have been collecting on one big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a great cast and cast character short to begin with a smaller core of characters that can be a little more variety can add later - which I hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more varieties will be needed.
