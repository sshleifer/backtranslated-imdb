In life, we first organize rocks (Piedras in Spanish) as a career, family, friendship, and love. In this way, we will find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough space for larger rocks. The five protagonists in this film are women who could not organize the great "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish photo director director defines his first rock feature in this way. The film tells the parallels, conflict trajectories of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen Vicky Pena, 1954 -) Everyone tries to remove rock that insistently appears in the paths or, worst, in the shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance of life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) that also stars in "20 centimeters," "Busco," "Crimen Ferpecto," "Viv Vivar y Sonar," "Hongos," and " Octavia.
