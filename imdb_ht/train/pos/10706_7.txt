This is a good example of a movie that in spite of the low rating is more than worth seeing. The story is engaging and it does not take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention. Acting is the first and the characters to represent well. Sometimes it feels like the director could not decide himself between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's presentation of the law respects and shakes English and pornography. Hidden magazines in the room create plenty of time to laugh! As Nicole Kidman looks at when she offers her first taste to John's intimacy in a long time ... Other actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a good expertise in a dramatic slim.
