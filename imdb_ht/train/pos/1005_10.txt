The Verhoeven movie was extremely crowded and filed. It's a lousy hack to a director and should be disappointed. By his own admission, read 2 chapters in the book, he was bored, and he decided to do everything in the scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would never support garbage if she would live to see it. It basically steals the name, political mockery of the book (which is a good portion of it), and launches into some T & A so the average idiot American movie theater is not getting bored. <br /> <br /> This animated is not perfect, but it's at least especially accurate, as best I can say.
