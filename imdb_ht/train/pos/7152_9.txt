'Hole' was a GREAT movie. Disney has made the right choice. Everybody I talked about was saying they loved it. Everyone casted was fit for the parties, and Shia Labeouf really has a future and acted. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for the Warden, it was exactly how I imagined it. Everyone who has not seen it I recommend it and I guarantee you will 'dig it'.
