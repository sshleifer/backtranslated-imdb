Excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the take-up for granted, ordinary shovels are exchanged during Mardi Gras. The movie is more than a globalization comment. In fact, it is humanitarian workers in China, the factory owner, the beater's distributor in New Orleans, and even revelers in New Orleans. What to say is the most the director's ability to tell a tough story and complicated detail in a simple and seductive manner. Her amazing access to the factory is another aspect of the intriguing and I only want I knew how it was inside. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion gives hope without letting people feel alienated.
