This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta's performance brought tears in my eyes and joy in my heart - this movie shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie was from the end of 1988, instead of Man rabbit, Hulce would certainly have been nominated for a better actor Oscar. Definitely a must-see!
