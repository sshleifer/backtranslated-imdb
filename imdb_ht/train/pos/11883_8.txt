I saw this film about a week ago and always keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very credible and likable almost to a fault. As in real life even though sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with Leo, who though I liked her character I could not have been more disappointed when she wanted to have unprotected sex even though well aware of HIV status his. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicines available to him, and the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home to the train. I think this movie has shown in a very real way why HIV numbers are up to gay boys. This is in no way meant that gay poets (my gay) and films very well could be done on a young right person who makes bad choices and looks unaware of the consequences of himself and others. The only part of the film I could not understand was why the family (gay friendly) wanted to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point by not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> I think the biggest message in this film is that whether gay or straight is NOT UNPROTECTED SEX!
