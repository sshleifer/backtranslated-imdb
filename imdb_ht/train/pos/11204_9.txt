Use symbolic of object, shape correction, character position in the scene ... these are all used and abandoned as joy by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius was. Wife's wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the battle progresses, the correction when the wedding ring is placed on her fingers ... while these may seem somewhat obvious by today's standards The silent era spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has a smaller four meaning that I can see; The boxing ring, the wedding ring, the lover's bracelet to buy, and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
