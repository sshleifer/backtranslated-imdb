Here is one the whole family will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall outdid herself with this unique, imaginative take on almost all the quotes that are popular in childhood. The scripts offer new twists of our age-old fabrics we have grown on and they feature a handful of stars in every episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and in my opinion it's one of the top five in the series, marked by Jennifer Beals (remembering it's "Flashdance" - and still in Hollywood today makes a movie here and there) in the title role, Jean Stapleton as the fairy tale and a southern accent and Arden Eve as the accomplishment of cruel stepmotherhood. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day") and Jane Alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepisters. Matthew Broderick is Prince Henry's Prince. You will all keep coming back for this one!
