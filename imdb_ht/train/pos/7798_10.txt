I can not begin to describe how amazing this film is. Suffice says, whenever I'm depressed about how dishonest or things are useless to look like, this movie is my going to put me in the right frame of mind. The background music makes you realize ease of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness. The American girl who sings is just an example of a character in this film that does not try hard, and it is happy as a result. Perspective, co-worker of Ruby's (Ashley Judd) is another = high eye and smile can make the most difficult day of the day. I watch this movie and I dream day better come up or in a good conversation with friends, and I realize that being alone - Ruby is alone very often - not the same as being lonely. Recommends that anyone enjoy a thoughtful calm in a movie.
