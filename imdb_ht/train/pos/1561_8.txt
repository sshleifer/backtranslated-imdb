I really enjoyed this episode. See flash, cyborg, green arrows, and Aquaman (though all she did was swim) to make my eyes grow. To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down Lex Luthor what I was waiting for. This sounds a bit of subject, but doing live action Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to blush everything that I usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. This is the thrill I got to watch this episode. I wish that this episode was made shortly again, as a two hour special, because I felt that one hour in the Justice League was not enough. Now, before I make you (unless I already have and rambling me) I just mean, Smallville is cool again. It sort of losing its earnings when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the writers will just fall back into this village hole. :( So enjoy this episode.Who knows when another good one will come out. Grab it again this Thursday, February 22, if you miss the first airing.
