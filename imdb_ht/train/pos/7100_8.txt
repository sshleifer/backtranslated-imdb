I saw her film in Dallas, Texas when she was from 1986. I remember giving out the prices to show up to seeing the movie. After seeing the movie I can see why. The movie was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this movie was that he tried to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it into Saga Masters. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth. They even use the same scenes from the Master Saga, but with different dialogues. As a kid, I liked the movie. But unfortunately I have not seen it as an adult and can not give a better review. Looking back I was disappointed, but now I want to see the movie and re-evaluate my position on it. What they say, will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and I can not wait for the Shadows Chronicles.
