Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis's business show, so many things were fake in this movie. First of all, the musicians claimed Elvis opened her famous show to live in '69 after a 9-year movie film by wearing a mournful jump-suit made in 1972. Also stated that she sang ' burning love 'that he first sang songs in 1972 and the' wonder of you 'that he first recorded in 1970. They also claim that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for her birthday. I know that all past movies have something wrong but things are so obvious to those who love Elvis.
