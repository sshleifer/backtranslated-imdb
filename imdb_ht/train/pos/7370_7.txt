Some have compared this to the Passover movie. I believe in Mice and Men are the most appropriate. We the leader of Heaton, definitely love Spike. It is irrelevant and immaterial if it is a sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as their only connection to humanity. The setting, scenario, minimal throw all adds up to a fine movie. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I was caring about what the movie maker did with them. He did good to them. I spent some time wondering how the finish would look like Mice and Men. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
