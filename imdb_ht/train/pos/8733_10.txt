When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out of video after being released in the theater I saw a trailer for this saying from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this would be a good feature! I was fine! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is a great story, great character and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim Ririn Beetle's voice by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Blue Caterpillar by hitting Joe Ranft's Pixar Storyman. My favorite scene is when the slim walking rod (David Hyde Pierce) stands up Hemlich is trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich as you like Mr. Early Bird. How about a delicious worm on a stick with the slim as I'm going to melee! I'll bite! I just died laughing at this stage. Being a big bug fan I think life a bug is my favorite Pixar though I know a lot people consider it the worst pixar movie ever! I do not know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think they're all very good movie! Good PIXAR work!
