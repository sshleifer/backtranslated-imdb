I wish I could laugh again as I saw this show for the first time. I have not done this ever since. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again, and again. Eddie Izzard is cultivated, intensely, is a man in the world. It's clumsy talk about politics and yet feels no need to "engage" in political disputes. It is higher than that. I would contrast it to George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his idea and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he tries to amuse .. <br /> <br /> Funniest guy on Earth
