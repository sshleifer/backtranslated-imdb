I think that this movie got a low rating because it was deemed by its worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke with a nasty black-scratched scene, but apart from that there's actually quite a moment that makes me laugh loudly. Jason Lee is doing some wonderful subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles managed to be very curiously comedy herself. Apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedy, after about 40 minutes of it you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, the best movies look but definitely do not choose the worst ... Cheers
