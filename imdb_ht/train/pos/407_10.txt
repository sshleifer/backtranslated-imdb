Oh my gosh ... Just give me a minute breath. This movie takes you on an awesome ride and does not let you go until the very last blow of your face ends. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and those. The Zu Zu legend was created very well, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of ins up. I wanted to see the real fight but, well ... a little bit left downs, and I did not really like it very much until I looked at it again, when you understood it more he totally kicked A **! I encourage anyone ever wanted to see a true Asian film, to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Go and see it when it comes from America !!!
