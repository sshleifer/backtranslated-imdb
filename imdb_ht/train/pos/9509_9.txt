Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says he has a slow speed. I thought the pace was perfect. The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks and perfection that is a sort of hit-man / assassin working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). It dissuades this work but because Rooney pays for his home and helps it financially. He had nothing to do with Mr Rooney giving him everything. But her children are unaware that this is her job, and when one witnesss a cold blood without her, he is placed in an awkward position. But when an atrocity arrives, he leaves with his son, he is bent on revenge. They stole abuse and more and build a bond. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude law that plays its role in perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and many shows how the 1930s were.
