Seeing this in the theater of '86 and falling out of my chair I laughed more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... it is the best of the damn baths that ever lived." <br /> You know how it will end but it has a great time getting there. Training scenes are very funny but the best power scene is the one when Jack and Reno are trying to watch Falcons v. Vikings Monday night soccer game while trying a dinner make-up with their wives. Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's too bad that it's neglected as a top tooth comedy.
