With all this going down at this time and MJ I started listening to his music, watching the odd document here and there, watch Wiz and watch Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get a certain insight into the guy I thought was really cool in the eighties just maybe make my mind if it is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part of BIOS, film feature part that I remember will see in the movie when it was originally released. Some of them have subtle messages about feeling the MJ towards the press and the obvious message of drugs are bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Some may call MJ an egotist to consent to making this movie but MJ and most of her fans would say she did it for the fans that if true is really nice to her. movie bit when it finally starts only about for 20 minutes or so except the Smooth criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convinced as a psychopath all powerful drug owners. Why he wants MJ to die so bad is beyond me. Because MJ had heard his plans? Well, Joe Pesci's character has come up with that he wants people to know he is who gives drugs etc. So I Dako, maybe he just hates the MJ's music. Much cool thing in this as MJ turns into a car with a robot and all the speed demon sequences. Also, the director must have patience at a saint when he came to film the bad kiddy sequence as usually hate director working with one kid leaving alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene. Bottom line, this movie is for those who like MJ on one level or another (which I think most people). If not, then stay away. She tries and gives a good message and notably the earlier MJ in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever favored this planet, but is it guilty? Well, with all the attention I gave to this topic .... hmmm well i do not know because people can differ behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. It is either a very nice, but stupid guy or one of the most ill. I hope it's not the letter.
