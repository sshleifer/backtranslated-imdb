I actually did not start watching the show until it came on FX. I was bored and nothing to look and see that the show reruns was premiering so I decided to watch it. I was so angry that I did not watch the show when she first revealed on t.v. I liked the show very much! Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember the complete House and Matters and Step by Step and showed ok but just not funny enough. They would make mute jokes and laugh about things that were just plain sort, but not 70s. That 70s show was hilarious, smart and so real. I think he's the best ever to do and I'm very sorry that he's finished. Although I love this show, I think it should end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show should end when his character left. I still love this show and I hope TV starts doing more shows like this one.
