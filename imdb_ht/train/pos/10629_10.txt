Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster, and a frying pan. . . If you do not mind the psycho-thriller or movie genre film, and you have a special place in your heart for the twist, this is the movie for you. An amazingly well-developed first film, "Hatred in One Minute" has all the plot of mainstream hit as "The Silence of the Lambs" and in classic cults such as "The Dark Army." The correction and effects are well done, better than many films in the genre. Kallio draws a complicated story of drawing torture on writing the Bible and writing the poet. At a time when big budget, the big movie missing a lot in the way the substance, the independent movie was resurrected this sad death. If you like Michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller go check out "Hatred in a minute."
