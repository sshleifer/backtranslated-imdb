I stumbled through this (Law-I) by the best dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago. This was'nt even what label on the cover on the tape mentioned. He surprised me. He intimidated me. She shocked me. I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later, I had to think about it again. Then go and buy both acts. They were even better than I had the first experience. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while Police Tank keeps on going on and on being at war with crime, warranty tanks and heavy weapons, it would seem as if they really have a hard time with criminals. This is either never shows or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easier in the allotted time. If this bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly was not shown as such. <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could be anywhere as good as the American version. But concerning the story, there are certainly some proper explanations that are lost in translation but can be apologized.
