I have not heard about Brashear before I watched this. This is the story of him and the trained man, helping him to become the first African American Indian marine diver. A story of willingness. The scheme is well written, and it develops nicely at all. This is what it looks like, this indirect type, and does not hold too many surprises. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. But it gets the job done, with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way, and this is inspirational for anyone who has ever heard the words "No, you can not" be talking about dreams of long life. Performance to act all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. Both shine every time they're on the screen. Rapper is beautiful, as well. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well edited, with good cinematographic features. Their production value is high, and this makes a convincing job to transport ourselves back to 50 years. This is the only movie I've seen this director and the writer, though I can now consider entering in more will be responsible for. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there is no offensive material. I recommend that anyone who finds the topic interesting, and / or fan of those who did it. 7/10
