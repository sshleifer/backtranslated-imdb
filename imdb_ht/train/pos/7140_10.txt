20 out of 10 This is a really wonderful story about a seasonal evacuate with a curmudgeonly carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is billeted with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he had serious problems when he wet his bed on the first night. William is illustrated with fear but somehow found comfort in each other's loneliness. It transpired that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choreographer in an entertaining rendition of Jerusalem. William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench, a young Jew from London and along with both Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns and writes and feels part of this small community close. As she is settling down, William is reminded back to London by her mother, and she is here we see why she is so aiming up. Her mother is sick sick and when Tom does not hear from William, she travels to London to look for her. He finally found him holding his dead baby sister where he was tied to a cellar. After a period of hospitality, Tom realized he must kidnap him and take him home with him. The bigger point is a bitter end when William said it is to be adopted by Tom, while at the same time learning Zacharias his best friend was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom spoke to an official in the Home Office. <br /> I love 'im, a' for what it's worth, I think he likes me too. <br /> It just does not get much better than doing it?
