This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some campy moods and death scenes that can be sort of funny. I personally liked the movie because of its off-humor humor. It's definitely not a super awesome movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared with paranoia afterwards. I liked the performance of the mountain guy and in Lester ... very credible. I think I'll dye my red hair like that of scarecrow girl - very cool! Anyway, in general it is worth renting for the campy humor and typical horror experiences.
