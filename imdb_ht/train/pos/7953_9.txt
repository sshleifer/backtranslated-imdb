This film has a three-year end later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man make the voice of chance. Fox has some juvenile energy to bring in the role. Usually gardener does great job as Sassy.Doname is fantastic as shadow.This was the second actor film actor veteran.Also the actors are great.Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford -Seaver .Robert Hays is Bob Seaver.Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford.Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford.Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver.Jean Smart shows Kate.It's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the desert. See Sassy taken by rivers and it looks like hinged hay. The beer scene is exit and funny. Luckily there is no luck with that great, hungry bear.And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful. This is some great fun for the whole family.
