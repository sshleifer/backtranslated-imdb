A really great movie with true stories. Dan Jansen the Greatest Skater ever. A touch movie and beautiful family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fights with cancer and Dan Jansen loves for his sister. In a significant promise by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister Jane was entitled to believe in his talent at speed skating was justified. This photo is well worth the time. I wish they would make more movie of this kind. Thanks for a great movie with excellent actors and an excellent story. It is a very touching story about a wonderful family and faith support for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister.
