Human Tornadoes (1976) is in many ways a movie better than it's predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and to treat Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acting. The performers do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the sink. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and it's not as stiff as it was in Dolemite. <br /> I enjoyed the movie very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, he's catered towards a certain audience (I'm very skeptical that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Check It Out! <br /> <br /> Highjly recommended.
