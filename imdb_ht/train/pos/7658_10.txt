I saw this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, Etched in my memory never let me is a scene from which Mickey Rooney, - "Miller Mears" knows that it is to be executed and it will come close at the time of Truth, He dance, and cry, and laughs, it shots from the big eyebrows movement and runs the gambit of ever-emotions. Never have I seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dying, past or present. It was then I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great engineering actor. However I kept it up, my opinion to myself for years to think, surely I must be alone in this opinion. About 15 years or so after I saw this movie for the last time on television, I read aloud the Q & A section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier You are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who then you consider to be among the greatest actors?" His answer, "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately shone back to her "Mears Killer" And I felt very good to see this great ability in him, and now I have seen my support by another job that I admire .. Later of course there "Bill" and many other great moments with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile" should be seen by all students acting. I honestly can not remember a great deal on the movie after all these years but Mr. Rooney in it, will never leave me. If someone has to remember this movie as I do? I would be interested in hearing from you. For this picture engraved in my heart alone I gave her a 10 just about to face her performance.
