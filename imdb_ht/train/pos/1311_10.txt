This is one of the best movies out there and he says a lot he has for TV. I really want it was about d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was given such a raw performance. He plays a rookie fury thrown in the locker case series perfectly. When it fell apart because it killed another kid it was amazing. She is so alone, so she gets him. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought him to his black world. It was Oscar-worthy. When she talks about killing children, scary! When he realizes who he really is! What a scene !! <br /> They really do not like that again. It was a real thriller without being spoiled.
