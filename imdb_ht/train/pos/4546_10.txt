This film will descend down to history as one of the big ones, right along the side of Kane, Casablanca, and the Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to make an end! Leno and Morita are a comedy Duo, the love that has not been seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you the thrills. Characteristic characters as the buffoonish oaf heard back in the days of Shakespeare's comedy. With the highest point. My goodness, the highest score. I will not ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of Star's death speak in comparison. If you can follow this hard-to-get gem, make yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I always hold out hope for a DVD edition special one of those days.
