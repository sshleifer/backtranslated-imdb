Steven Spielberg has produced, wrote, came up with ideas and even directed the Amazing Story episode, so naturally this should make the greatest anthology ever right? Sadly wrong. Some episodes are just fantastic, but all too often it was a mixed bag. In fact, that would have been her fall was way too mixed. Some episodes have been cedar light, some have been playful, some were horror, and one even hosted, which made this a similar but not as good 80s version of the Twilight Zone (which also was around). Normal <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the most dramatic dramatic episodes felt like they'd better have been late at night on the entire lifetime network, like the "Ghost" train, episode by Spielberg himself. In that episode, he gave the message of hope, and he gave us a fantasy story, but in general it was just a build up to the finish that did not blow me off. The horror episodes tended to work better than the drama, but there was far more dramatic, and they grew tireless to watch. Wise acting, this anthology has some great stars, just as the original Twilight Zone. Kevin Costner, Kiefer Sutherland, Milton Berle, Dom Deluise, Harvey Keitel, Beau Bridges, Charlie Sheen, Forrest Whitaker, Tim Robbins, Jan Lithgow, Rhea Perlman, Danny Devito, Patrick Swayze, Christopher Lloyd, Jen Lockhart, Kathy Baker, Weird Al Yankovich and many other well-known episodes of the show. It's fun to see well-known actors in almost every episode of the series. Major directors also included episodes including Spielberg himself, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Bob Clark, Joe Dante, Mick Garris, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante, Robert Zemeckis, Danny Devito and even Martin Scorsese. I would actually recommend this more fan of the directors and / or the 80s than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Amazing stories were sometimes amazing, usually good, occasionally mediocre, and every once in a while a real stinker out. But this show has nostalgic value for me, and it's sort of fun to sit on the noon and watch some episodes. John Williams's theme music for the show is sure to keep in mind anyone watching this too. <br /> My Rating: Good Show. 30 minutes. for each episode. TVPG
