Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as television host of film-horror movie night, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything out of commercial advertising spot on the Tonight show and Johnny Carson. It came to the peak of its popularity in the late 1980's, with the film ELVIRA, the MISTRESS in the DARK was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is flying. Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her big aunt dies, she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to become a scene show; It is shameful to have inherited a tired house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that the city is puritanical beyond any description, and it provokes the indignation of the widespread marketplace. It also happens that his great uncle is secretly an evil fighter and very intent on seizing the "old book." Throw in a few teenagers, a Stud Muffin, and a woman lovers and falsies and have you go. Nobody would accuse him of being a Cinemas chief, and he's dragging right now and then. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair at the start: extreme, sexy, and humorous lowbrow mixes and flashes of sharp comedy, dancing in the film as a ringmaster in a circus of blowing and often self-mocking jokes. Out of a magic-flaming magic disaster, it's never less than wildly entertaining. It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspicions. Is Elvira the best her uncle's evil and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun to get out. <br /> <br /> quality DVD is okay and there's little in the way of material bonuses, but if you're in the mood for something funny this one is sure to respond the urge. But if you have never seen tassel-twirling, you're in for a treat. Recommended. <br /> GFT, Amazon Review
