The film was excellent, saved for some of the scenes with Esposito. I liked how it brought together all the detectives on the series, and wrapped up some plotlines that were never solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was nice to see Pembleton and Bayliss along with the most people, and most basic people. Braugher and Secor have done a great job, but as usual will get overlooked. It hurt to see that this was the end of homicide. Memories, tapes, and reruns on CourtTV just are not the same as watching it come on every Friday. But the film did its job and it was very good, featuring a great portrayal of life after retirement, and family relationships that exist between the unit. I loved so much.
