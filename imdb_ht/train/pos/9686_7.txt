A sentimental story that has a sentimental smell. It's about a girl (with a voice impediment) who is his green treasure butterfly Paulie. The parrot believes and speaks like a human and provides help with his constant companion advice. The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. In times of malfeasance and at times of adaptation of the bird's depression, captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice also very well done and in a minute or two you can actually believe that this smart little bird exists. <br /> <br /> Early in his father's film to the bird in a pawnbroker and the subsequent scene tells Paulie's history of constant conflict over many years to be reunited with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when it comes to bad company and encourages to spy on people using the automatic teller machines. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The finish is predictable, but who wants it otherwise. Children will love this movie and everyone who holds a bird as a pet will delight in Paulie antics.
