What a fun movie! If you are a Giallo fan, Red Queen kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilty woman ridden fear for her life. Scenes of the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially beautiful and feature enough to make happy fans happy. One of the first thousands comes instead unexpectedly and really gets the movie going to a good start. The assassin, the Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top assassins and interesting looking I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s and the mods are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting and the Queen's Queen laughs run across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the movie. The complicated plot held my interest at all. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's note may be the best I've heard of the composer. The main theme is so memorable I could not get it out of my head for two days. The only problems I have with Red Queen killed 7 times come to the final movie. First, those responsible for killing are far too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple of Gialli, you will not have any problem to determine who is behind the killings. Second, the finish feels a little too hurry and, as a result, is a bit confusing. I definitely not one who needs every trace point spelled out to me, but I'll admit being at a loss to explain it all. A second look might just clear this up.
