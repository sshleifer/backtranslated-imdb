Hollywood imitates Joutiem its opera soap in its finest! It's fun that we have never seen. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so on the top .... Gary Marshalls lines are a riot .... this is what I love about good comedies. Never scared to peek the fun !!!!!! These were great .... wardrobe was on point and backstabbing "Montana The Morehead" was a delicate pleasure. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but no less still gorgeous and fun air on the screen. I would like to know how the idea for this movie came. Never have I seen a cast of people who have plenty of fun making comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
