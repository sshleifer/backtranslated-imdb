When I first went to watch the shine I was expecting a decent movie out of what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of other Stanley Kubrick's work but when I started to look it was so much better than me thought it would be. At times I seriously felt ridiculous and I could not take my eyes off the screen always having something very disturbing about everything in the movie. Now, some people do not like Kubrick's version of the brilliance since it does not fully follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's versions, the mini series and the book are all great. Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance .If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies on then watch the shining.
