This movie is just great. If you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana gets around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in any way and make it sound great. If you thought that Pulp Fiction was good and the swearing words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle of how an actor can tell them. (well it's sweet) <br /> <br /> though the film is having a lot of action and the plot moves very fast in time, by keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it's always easy to follow along, but you must Keep your eyes shaved at all by losing anything. Personally, I found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it's really just great. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of thoe movies that acts and directs so well as not only make you forget that this movie has been made in the 80s wrong but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy ... "So tell the good night BAD guy"
