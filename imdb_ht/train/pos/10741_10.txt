The French Naudet brothers did something that nobody did, having a video camera on the day that this tragedy happened. They were in building # 2, when you could see papers down, those who hit the ground from jumping from such a height. <br /> I mean it goes as far as both building collapses running the camera was still running, when the white dust covered, found a store door and got inside, but all this foot is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us. stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary movie that I watch every 9/11 so I will never forget what this country goes through. I believe that I remember right, it shows the death of the first priest in the firefighters, while he was brought to the church with his honorable funeral.
