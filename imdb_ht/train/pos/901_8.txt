Well ... Vivah is quite a good but typical Barjatya's sin. It shows different aspects of American families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not very good. The highest point in the movie is the direction, music and act of Shahid and the Amrita (especially the last stage). The movie begins with a common factor in American film --- A girl being nema by her mother's stage. History is the movie is a bit common, but it is good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Less points are common stories in Bollywood films. In general I would say it is twice to watch movie, if you want to see the typical Indian family values ​​and of course-love!
