This is one of the few films where I consider the film production to be an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and exciting with the music numbers without an exceptional doubt. I worship the cyclic conclusion of the 'Old House Guard' and the 'Good' Portobello Road, a great combination of early animation + real-featured actors who, though dating do not divert from the charm of the piece. The background of the Second World War worked well and did not leave the film on the road, which often came to the 'evacuated' story. <br /> A movie often quite too strong, it produces no end to fun for people of all ages. The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done with the entire texture being tied together well done. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
