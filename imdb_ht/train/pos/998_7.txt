This is a really interesting movie. It's a movie action and comedy mixing in. Foxx team up with Epps comedy in this movie giving it a funny turn. It will keep you wondering what will happen next Foxx. It was a well shot movie, the director used the right colors of this movie (color black color) to give it the right kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It is worth seeing it you did not see it. It's definitely worthwhile if you're a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more credit than it actually gives.
