I just went to a screening of the movie during the Corto Ceremony Expressions, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film rolled and out of the first shot I was amazed: one long continuous shot of a futuristic Paris of glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not go on and cause the details I think it is a worthy movie to see. The sci-fi story can get average for many ... I was really good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things you could not do or see is accomplished very well. Performance thrown in good, in my opinion no one hit the wrong score. 3D graphics view 2D. A comic book BW leads to life. The details of the backgrounds give more texture as if it were done (I'm sure it was handy if the angles change you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer of the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, he said, is brilliant, but maybe he was quite inexperienced since he had only had one short film in his CV. So many people had faith in them. They started their own studio from scratch and since they were facing the challenges they had brought on them. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the final look of this movie is his superior thinking.
