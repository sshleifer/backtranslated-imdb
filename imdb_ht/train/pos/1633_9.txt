I liked this cops when it came from the 80's and still done! I always quote classic lines like "tell it again" and "you said you'd rip my balls on guys". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was mixed and decomposed by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be a treasure to me and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a desert island! I just want someone to drop the DVD because my VHS tape is torn out! If you love comedy comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered a classic cult! It is military humor in it's best and worse! Rent it if you can not own it!
