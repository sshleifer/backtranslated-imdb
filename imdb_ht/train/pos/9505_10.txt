This is a truly magnificent movie with heartwrenching !!!! Ripstein's location is spectacular, very detailed and well-lit, the dialogue is extraordinary García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performance as Colonel and his wife. <br /> You must see it !!!
