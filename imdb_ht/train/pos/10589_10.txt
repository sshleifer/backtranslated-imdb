I enjoyed Longstreet, followed by Raymond Burr's successful stage in Ironside TV series and intended to compete with him. But this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - I believe wrong - This Longstreet could not compete with Mr Burr Ironside <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot to show that It was especially well done and very memorable. I hope that a series of Longstreet boxes will appear. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this idea was only small explored here and that much more could and should have to show the play and disability related TV.
