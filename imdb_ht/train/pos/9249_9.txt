This film is witty, watch and touch touch. And now you often see to see Jean Harlow (or any actress of that era, for that matter) to give another woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) After Ruby Harlow was sent to a reformer after mixing up with the Edward Hall Gable (he's whipping again crocheted smile), his situation gets all the more complicated when he discovers that he is pregnant and He is convinced that this racy has abandoned it, but in fact, he likes to reform him and come to see him, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and in the help of a minister, to marry. The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with his fellow prisoners is second only to his electric chemistry and gable, who was most often it's leading man. His cynical character is a perfect match for the smooth-talking gang robber. What does not like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you should not be a bad sleeping - if it was not for your face!" Ruby removals remarks for gypsy, rival. "If you're going to get close to me, I'll have to open the other window!" Priceless !!!
