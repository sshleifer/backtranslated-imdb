This movie has slipped into the cracks in movie history. It is not much better than some other New York films in the same time as: "The French Connection" or "taken in Pelham 1-2-3". There is a bravest reality of this film that also manages to effectively use the more humorous draw lines. It engages from starting to finish and has not been extinct with age as is the case with the two highest examples. Ron Liebman turned into a brave performance as "Batman" and it's a shame of his career as a result of this project. Gordon Parks directs and comes as it does after "shaft", it first appears a strange choice. But it is the flip side of that much earlier and approaching approach and just as much of your machisia figure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie was not available on either DVD or VHS in the United States. United artists really have a gem on their hands and it's a shame they're not doing anything with it.
