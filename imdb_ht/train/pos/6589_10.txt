I liked to show this from its first airwave, and I always look forward to watching every weekly episode. The plot, character, writing, special effects were outstanding! Then the Sci-Fi channel came up again, it canceled a very fun, well-written writing. I said he brought it back, and I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD, myself. I hope that executives can find words in the comments, and realize that they need more involvement with viewers. I only watch one show on which channel now, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm sure to make sure that it will soon be canceled too.
