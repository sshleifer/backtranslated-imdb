I saw this in "Dance and Movie", and he was scared. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding adult to injury! Not only do your parents get divorced, but have a monster after you. <br /> It was both heartbreaking and scary - there were several moments where the audience was crying in genuine genuine. It kind of reminds me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was actually good. So what separates Jake's closet from the usual filabile pabulum movie - an excellent script with compelling characters. Also, by mixing elements of the horror movie and family drama, the movie gets the best from both genres, and avoids the clicks of both. <br /> If it is not coming out of theater, definitely get the DVD.
