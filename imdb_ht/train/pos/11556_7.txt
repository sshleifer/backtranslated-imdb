Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ended their career together. Remembering the best Grumpiest of Old Men and the Odd couple ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau was one of Hollywood's best comedy crews in the last 100 years. Not as "raunchy" as Pryor and Wilder, instead, were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Like the physical comedy as mixing the mix of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for. In the odd couple, Lemmon and Matthau play the whole opposite of the mess. The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke usually on top of them as opposed to joking about another. By typing your typical guy, she is in a way to come up with comedian ages and two old men as opposed to young teens in their prime. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is amusement enough. Although this film is not for everyone, this is a great comedy.
