Usually, when we use the word "sketch," we mean it is negative; Warren Beatty's great screen version of "Dick Tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless character, Beatty creates a detective whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without its weakness. From there, the rest of the characters is almost a world of themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the snowman of any crime aircraft to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most compassionate person; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is cruel on average: without pity but cool. Other characters include the speech-defying Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the music-88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin), and the Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also stars. <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I do not even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and failing too far - to find some nude Big Boy ways. Together, some very rare events have gone to the city, the answers may be or may not be nearer than everyone thinks. Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty has had trouble acting his age, then he has made good use of this here. "Dick Tracy" is one cool film.
