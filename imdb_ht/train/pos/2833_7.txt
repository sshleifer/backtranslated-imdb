Just re-seen this film after thirty years. I was eleven years old and kept this flick on South Beach in time to go to the Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it's been! It was a very good movie. Now, however, after nearly forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this film is now a tired old re-hash in the war between generations. He did however, to catch somewhere in time which is just a memory. It's really interesting to see the mod mods, the old Vegas, a Slim Don Rickles, the smoking chain, and a hip opening song. The act was decent, the script somewhat out-date, but the memories were always cool. Where it's In, can not be where it's for you, but for me, it's always been a nice trip and fun down memory lane.
