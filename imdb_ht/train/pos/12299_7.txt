Filmed by MGM on the same sets as the English version, but in German, Garbo's second painting of "Anna Christie" benefited from its apparent convenience and German dialogue. Garbo appears more relaxed and natural under the direction of Jacques Feyder than under the Clarence Brown, and his film animism has all but disappeared, which made its transition to full sound. His strength brought to the character remained here, although he was honed, and Garbo revealed more of Anna's vulnerability. All the cast, with the exception of Garbo, is different from the previous version of the movie, and the Garbo benefit does not compete with Marie Dressler, who stole each scene she was in during the English version. In Feyder's film, Garbo holds the center of widespread attention, although three players support, particularly the father, gave excellent performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clarence Brown's, and its use of the camera and correction techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as those of brown. The movie moves with more fluidity than adaptation in English, and the static nature of the movie was first replaced with a flow that holds visual viewer interest. Even William Daniels cinematography seems to improve on filming it in Brown's version. He captured Garbo's glowing and atmospheric docks and style. Also, the adaptation of scenario for the European audience made Anna's profession clearly from the outset, and the explanation clarified for viewers who were familiar with the play as that was only implicit in the filming of Brown. However, the film was made before the Production Code was introduced, which made the intriguing censorship. Oscar Garbo's nomination for "Anna Christie" has always been a bit mystifying, and I suspect that the nod was more in acknowledgment of his relatively smooth film transition than for his performance. However, some of the Academy's voters can see the German-language version of the film, and they realize, as will be recent viewers, that it "Anna Christie" under the direction of Feyder was definitely Oscar worthy.
