After seeing this movie once again, it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than before I saw it. The act is stunningly wonderful. Characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the fake son who rebel. Other actors and actresses are equally fine in all respects. Robert Redford created a wonderful period from the days of speakeasies in the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful in the mountains and rivers in western Montana. All in all, this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s. <br /> You must see this movie! <br />
