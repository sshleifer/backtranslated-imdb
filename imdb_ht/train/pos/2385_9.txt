In the old commercial for empty audio tapes, the tag line was "is it real or is it Memorex?" The same can be said for the events of this episode - a compilation and remix of the "Cage," the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock has been cleverly commandeered the pirate ship to Talos IV to ban it in order to allow Capt. Christopher Pike, his first commander who was burned and paralyzed, returned. Why the finagling? Because there is any contact at all and Talos IV invites a death sentence. Why this is never explained - which bothers me much - but if nothing else, it adds to the story. After he got the ship for traveling to Talos IV, Mr. Spock gets himself to Dr. McCoy (the nearest senior officer; Kirk was off the boat) for arrest and said, "The charge is mutiny, Dr. I never received orders to take the boat." What follows is a court The martial arts - thanks to the Talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for Captain Pike to go to Talos IV even at Mr. Spock's death. Talosians' illusions create, the background music and the whole storyline is fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as the keeper (Talosian to head) is wonderful. Call me sexist but it never happened to me to have a woman in that role but it was perfect! The Talusians, it has provided almost all physical activity and become almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also innings; you can not really say if they are male or female and really do not have trouble. This episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and prayers have other world out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! What a neat thing if this was so great! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I have it on video), it never fascinates me. Meg Wyllie looked like an alien and I did not mean that wrong.
