It's not beyond my understanding that much litter from Norway has been remastered for DVD release, and still gems like this does not get a shot to revive their glory. I give this a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian TV. This film is nothing less than a film-historical gem that in many ways predicted the first foreign movie. And, my words, Blindpassasjer was first! Is Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew seeing the mini-series? However, the fact remains that the scenes are very similar. Well, the budget is _much_ lower in the Norwegian film, but given that, it's a really good piece to work from the decent age of Norwegian-made films, which incidentally lasted until the 90s.
