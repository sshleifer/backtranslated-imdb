What is so taboo about love? People seem to have great problems with the transgenerated. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie did not catch my eyes. It was a tablet shot over 4 minutes in the movie that caused me to stop surfing. I could not believe how frantic this movie was. It touches on many levels of human emotions that he did not once fail to move me in some ways. It is by far one of the best films I've ever seen. I did not see these characters as either sex, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent film. Praise for all filmmakers!
