This Anime movie was a rather good movie that I kept once on the Science Fiction Channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the disaster ratings that swimmer adult claims it is on the cartoon network. I quite honestly think it's less done and it was less popular and more with the fact that people prefer to buy DVDs to watch the uncut episodes on the internet. This movie though probably did not have all that much off and the voice work was okay for an armed movie, though I would prefer to look at the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for the child in nothing armed. This film features a young boy who is framing a train called the Galaxy Express in hoping he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot his revenge robot, who was brutally murdered in the hands of a robot who hunts people for fun. During the course of his adventures he becomes acquainted with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman who resembles her deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who is like with most women in Anime movies there a secret that might be either really good for our young hero, or really bad. It goes from planet to planet as the train and its various runs run in a space ship named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own cartoon series, so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in this universe. All in all a very good ride with a rather unusual and unexpected finish. There would be an end to this one, but it was not quite as good as this one, however the finish was a bit more final than it was here.
