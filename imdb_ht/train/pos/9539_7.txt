For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little bloodshed then this movie for you! There is a good amount of blood flow to the extent of this movie, also the effects can be impressive and awesome. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, they have not been chained down to what we as hearings are waiting in from these days. <br /> <br /> Also remarkable are the little aliens, whom I found beautiful. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and versions for this unusual Japanese film approach, full of observing wonderful and bloody flows. Of course, seeing this movie you should already have the knowledge of the two.
