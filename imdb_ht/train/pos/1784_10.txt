Evening is a fun movie and quite some depth. All actors and actresses turn into spectacular performances. With the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar, but in this movie the expectations are beyond. Someone can relate to personalities and situations in their own family. As one look at the interaction of family members one own memories of families immediately brought in mind. This is one of the few movies that inspired one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; One reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I'll definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular as the soundtrack. Any brakes will enjoy the apparently restrained buses. Needless to say, but I recommend Tonight. Watch it you will enjoy it.
