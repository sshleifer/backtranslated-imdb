I remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was surprised by how much they could fit in a short 8 minutes. We start in a campus. . Two friends are struggling about jumping the class. Kid B says Kid A "Do not go to class today." And Kid A refusal, claiming to miss something that's really important. So kid B goes with the kid to go to class. When it comes to having the teacher informed him that today they were going to learn the only lesson and most important lesson they will ever learn. They wanted to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a booklet, and when she gets kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to her to share. Well, the kid will not share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When it finally finds it, it becomes a shocking revelation on that real meaning in life. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes into your life, but the message is so important, it might help you for a lifetime.
