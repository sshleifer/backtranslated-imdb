This movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant and narrative parts with the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that all add to the keep keep it going on. Insomniac's nightmare is original and refreshing different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will have you discussing the twists and turning it into the conscious and subconscious. It has a feeling of eery and its black interpretation of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became the ensomniac. He is a great actor who is not difficult on the eyes either! It really poured its entire roots into this role. From the storyline of how he shot to do this indie one of my favorites. I recommend it very and quickly wait to see more of this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematic!
