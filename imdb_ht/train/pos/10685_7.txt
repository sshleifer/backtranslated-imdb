This film has a clear storyline, which is quite strange genre of music. "Chat", "Phantom of the Opera", and other musicians Andrew Lloyd Webber may consider metaphorically, as they use literary works as their foundations. "Historical Bentang Menarians" (BBM) in scenarios touches the very core of human relationships, especially those of Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on an "supposedly" fairy, it's actually a fantasy of the 'child' of Indonesian adounese. Dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I rule the choreographer should explore Indonesia way of dancing, not by dismaying the fact that Indonesian dance development tends to be more auxiliary. The dance sequences are awkward in some ways and are not synced with songs and / or music. But I still love this movie and consider it as a new wave of Indonesian film genre that I hope to enhance in the future.
