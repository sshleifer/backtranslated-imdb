I found it very interesting that the movie actually managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and the origin of Chinese origin. It becomes a history of value, and it causes overseen reevaluation their own choices of life, and loyalty toward institution. Surprisingly, he managed to do so in a gentle, comic humorous manner, which was only in secret retrospective to threaten the situation somehow. I enjoyed the movie, and I would watch it again if I could.
