I thought this was a very good movie. It would be good to have seen a little more in the movie about the two sisters knowing about every single boy's boy before he was killed. I'm sure the movie has been doing this way would be a very different finish, so this has made this move like a good movie. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your sibling that you can always get to it and that if it's 2 sisters deal with a boy, (the same boy) is working until pain and hurting to make things look best and easier to work between 2 of them. It's good to see love stories that have something terrible to happen in someone's life that you can always get it gets even closer after it's over. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do now when it comes to. I seem to find myself watching it every time he comes over. It would be good if there would be a part 2 for this movie, maybe the older sister has come and have her baby, this would really have made a great end to the story since she died, that way he would keep it alive even if he died.
