Anton Newcombe makes the film and is the main topic. Watching her hit a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks it is god, but so prollific and interesting. The DW is not really interesting in music comparisons or otherwise. "Hey, are you a driver license?" , Anton says the cameraman, "well let's go to plant this guitar!". Use of large archives / home video materials. Great to see stone documents still being made. A cool doc on the creative process. If you like this visit Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sell ​​Out! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
