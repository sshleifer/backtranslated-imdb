STAR RATING: ***** Incredible **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Can Go Out For A Rather Instead * Avoid All Spending <br /> Stuck Career Careers Kate (Franka Potent) chief of London under the ground to catch a train to take him to meet George Clooney. However, after a day of hustle working, he made off and got up to find himself alone in a deserted platform. As he races on a situation taking him out of one encounter encounter in the next, however, he learns of something sickly and badly is waiting for it out there. <br /> In a lot of ways, the British Film Industry is truly becoming one of its own, especially in the third thriller department, and film like Creep and Success 28 days later (which has strong echoes in the party.) In terms of success in what it set out to do, Creeping Making creates (especially at the beginning) a sense of isolation and scary fear. At smart moments, she also (though inadvertently, I suspect) managed to pay homage to some of the pioneer high-horror movie horrors from the 70s that are counting on shock and fear of out without really focusing too much on development characters and like .. <br /> In his weakness, some scenes are slightly predictable, but these do not really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the finish was meant to make it come as some sort of playing morality and it's not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serving it in basic functions very well. ***
