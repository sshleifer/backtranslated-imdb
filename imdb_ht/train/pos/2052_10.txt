I do not have much to add to my resume, this movie rises to the right and Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made while not trying. I do not think it should be taken seriously when it looks as it is very enjoyable. <br /> I do not think it brings Christopher Walken's reputation down either as reputation he was on back then then anyway. He took pulp fiction to wake him out of the sleep he had entered. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the great comics while not trying to serious movie. Total Recalls, Top Guns. What I think is amazing is the budget of this movie. Scenes and actors and explosions etc. are quite amazing for obviously someone liked it very well and wanted to risk a lot of money. Anyone who read or she loves me because I love this movie! If anyone reads this information about McBain (and I'm seriously skeptical will have too much) just know that it's a hilarious movie and should see with a smile on your face!
