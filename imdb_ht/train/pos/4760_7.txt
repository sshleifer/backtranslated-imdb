Well I gave this movie a 7. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "At the Beginning" as far as the B5 movies went. I really think that the TV series did a better job in general with special effects and painted characters. Let's hope that the producers and cast find the next "Crusade" series up to the standards of B5.
