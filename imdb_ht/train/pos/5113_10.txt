This movie was a classic. I should say that this movie holds the best of a working man from his mistake. if we all can get together and learn the way everyone in this movie did. It has been an important part of showing how the family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a "big THROAT" and swallowing their pride.
