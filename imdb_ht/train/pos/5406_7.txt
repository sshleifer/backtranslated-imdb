The 4th Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not you say that Pokemon sucks! I do not like it when people say that .... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please say that Pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages. Also, why Pok√©mon-dog gives low ratings for all or most of the movie pokemon? I do not understand .... They should not do that .... There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving Pokemon absorbed in addition to the fact that: 1) Pokemon is for toddlers ONLY. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think this is why people do not like Pokemon.
