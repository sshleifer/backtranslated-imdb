This is not art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful people, t & amp; a, and action. I found it very fun. It's not intellectually interesting, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which are just sauce. Definitely worth a rental. So, in summary, I would recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!) <br /> <br / > The wicked are good too. Vinnie, Big Corey, the hatian guy from heroes. Very nasty bandits.
