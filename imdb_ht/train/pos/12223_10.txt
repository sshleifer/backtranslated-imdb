I saw True Crime when he first released back in the mid-nineties and I watched him many times since. It's a great mystery on Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), an old high school in a California city that was younger sister in the Condorite was tortured and killed by an unknown assassin. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police helmet who sees how bright it is and decides to work together to get the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this one. True crime feels very "true" or real to me. I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that the total suspension of the disbelief is present here and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role with Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn doing a great job, as do the other actors. Wherever the rights and writers / directors, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the reality of young life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary rose from the sequel to the dream after seeing the photographs taken by Tony). I wish Verducci would make more movies. <br /> I do not see any other movie quite like True Crime. 10/10
