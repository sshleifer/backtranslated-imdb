Ultra-movie drama crime from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Falling, she reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it's not as polished as that. But it is an engaged, defeat bit of destruction on a Cambodian solitaire, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While saving the scene, he killed the partner of Sam Wai's cop, who, to add insult to injury, is in the middle of dealing with his dead dad, so Sam starts a crazy, obsession manhunt for Pang resulting in near a dozen corpses and relentless violence. There must be something in the sky lately because I have never seen many people shaking the shit out of each other as I have lately. This is grimace, nasty thing, which is why I'm so part of it, and I applaud her downbeat attitudes. It visually captures and designs the sound very unique. Dramatically, everything spiral decline until each character finds it - or itself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot that includes Pang's attachment to a sexual abuse girl adds depth to the story and spawns a fourth act of surprise that has a lot of fine acts in grotesque operations.
