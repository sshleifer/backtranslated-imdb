This is the first 10 out of 10 that I gave any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - no slow, big acting, smart writing. I also loved the movie style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that does not try to please all sectors of the public (ie there is no forced romance). <br /> I loved the first Bourne movies, but I loved this one .. Warning - after watching this movie, you'll be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
