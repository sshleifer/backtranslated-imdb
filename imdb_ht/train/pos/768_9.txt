Cinematical, this movie feels. So, a lot of the act. But I <br /> <br /> do not care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80 were <br /> <br /> like (For a lot of us in the annoying innercity) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation, and Break dance they really love. Big music, great <br /> dance! It almost seems like a documentary at a time now than <br /> when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see New York's coming as Zero Earth from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> can be too young to note that It was a poor, run down the city <br /> for 70 years and 80 years. This is the best of all hip-hop / breaks in <br /> <br /> dancing movies that came out around this period. Of course the <br /> <br /> 80 is considered a joke now and all the bad TV shows and movies <br />, but of us who lived in it will always remember <br /> <br / > she lovingly for a time when music, dancing, and graffiti were cool, they!
