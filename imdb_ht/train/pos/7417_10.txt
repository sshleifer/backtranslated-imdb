This beautiful story of an elderly son comes home, and learns to love and be part of all the things that he has left home to get away, is intense and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps unheard of us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and at funny and funny times. It has a realism sentiment that we do not seem to see yet in our western cinema. <br /> <br /> The act is amazing, in how the movie progresses, it almost gives the impression that it does not act, but an ordinary person documentary. This is brilliantly directed and made film. <br /> <br /> Would like to see more movies by this director.
