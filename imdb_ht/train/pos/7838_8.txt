If you're a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I recommend you check this out. It shows a fantasy side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a very good time shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but the fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of becoming known as just people, and when the concert shows a talented musician, both playful and professional rock and looks impressed the girls screaming. Watching her in concert, you would never know that a rock star is a job, but just have a great time playing some great songs and some good friends, such as Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances . True, there are a few songs missing that I'd like to see on the, but like any album it can not have everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I knew it was from 1972, I would definitely buy it years ago. Sad and unusual that a man who has a lot of songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash!
