Though the elements drawn to the "Eighth Day" seem like they did many times, the film still has plenty of sparkle, and the symbol of Jaco Van Dormal's first film. Even though not as good as the "Toto Hero", which will always remain on my favorites list, the film still leaves us with many emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001 without the taste of the "Closet" his party downplays, scared them too much (just so, the role could easily be lost if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt the party needed a bit more realistic of it, focusing more on the character itself than simply the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not walk in this movie awaiting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got into the "Toto Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film always serves as a decent, if not flawed, film
