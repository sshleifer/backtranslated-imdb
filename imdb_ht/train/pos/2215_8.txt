I bought, "The Feast of All Saints," and it's not really a horrible movie, but a lot of things could be best. It has a lot of historical value, played out of very talented actress / actress, and it's not a daily event that actors can play out as a role and have it a little bit credible. There were some parts that were little mediocre and confusing, but I would not say that the movie was all terrible. Once you think about that, capturing the New Orleans 1800, and doing something out of it, it's very difficult, and much more difficult to get actors who can strongly signify these parts. But the only problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played people are free of color, were mostly light skinned african, not very universal in casting others who did not light skinned; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Who did the casting could have chosen a wider variety when it came to tents, despite many Krey√≤ls are color conscious. With picking actors who look near white in a sense, could have been thinking more out. The actors did a great job, the script could be best written, and overall I found their performance was very credible.
