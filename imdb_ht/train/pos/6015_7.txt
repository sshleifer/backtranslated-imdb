In the early 1970s, many of us have embraced hippy / acid / alternative culture with all hearts, have realized that mainstream society would not change in the way we thought it would. For me this film defines the tension "now what?" that many of the people I knew felt at that time. Do we head towards the community and create our own vision of Utopia or we radicalize and push for change? <br /> In the futile gestures to police, the radical speech, the music of Pink Floyd, in the love-making and the explosive images of the desert - much is in there. It captures quite an important moment in time.
