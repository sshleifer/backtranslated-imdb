When I read the story Armistead Maupins I was shot in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel Nobody with whom she cared about them and loved. That being said, we have now given the movie version of an excellent story and hope to see past the gloss in Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> And just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile sense of Gabriel and allows us to see her struggles with issues of faith both in her personal life (Jess) and the world around her (Donna) . <br /> <br /> As we are presenting players in this drama we remember that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives definitely. Request for review of a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel get the force itself to take on and move forward. It's the worst that most people will avoid this movie. I only say that because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That did not work before!" PLEASE PAY THIS PHOTO LOSS! Robin Williams touches our darkness all we must find and go in to ourselves to be the best people. Like his movie A Photo When he was promoted as an actor and made another piece of art. <br /> Oh and before I forgot, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene she is in. but the 1940's leader resembles the presence of screens. It's this hack's opinion he could bring his own movie right now !! <br /> S ~
