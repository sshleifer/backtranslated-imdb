Even though I love the EE "Doc" Book of Smith and David A. Kyles book at Lensman, the anime, which is loosely based on the books, is quite a fun and fairly innovative way. Though the story may seem familiar to sci-fi / fantasy fantasy, as some kid on an isolated planet heritage power heritage and avenge the death of her family, it is quite one entertaining however. Plus, Lensman was the first photo animated motion but used to draw and CG animation all at once. Sure, it can look a bit outdated right now, but it's still an innovation. If not for intensification, none of that would ever happen (personally, I think Computer Graphics looks best at animation that is living action.) Too bad are just released on DVD / VCD in a few countries at the worls ( especially in foreign and different formats). I just want to release the Lensman and TV movie about DVD / VCD in every part of the world, not just some parts. Calm rules! I just think it's so amazing and neat look too.
