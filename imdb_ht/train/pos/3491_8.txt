Throwing is excellent, good acting, the interesting plot, the evolving fullness of suspense ... but it's hard to bark all these elements into a movie that is barely 80 minutes long. If they took more time to develop the plot and subplots, it would have a better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good movie instead then just a good one.
