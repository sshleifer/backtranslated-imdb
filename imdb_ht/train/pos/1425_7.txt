Just like Al Gore shook us and unexpectedly and honestly featuring documentary-film "A Convenient Truth", director Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's about time improving our way of life in order to save for our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wakeful appeal that global warming in our planet has disaster consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore has shown us the weakest future in Earth's planet by presenting hard facts supported by documenting examples of long-standing monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not present us with a future representation of what can happen to our planet if we do not radically change things around, but they prefer to show us the genuine beauty of Earth's planet in all of its amazing glory. We see where we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide array of most extraordinary places like abandoned deserts, giant jungles full of deep and flora and ice-landscapes as far as the eye could see. And in all these incredibly different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. This is exactly the kind of movie that has to be done, in combination with the one from Al Gore, in order to realize that our planet is too costly for melee. The voice by Patrick Stewart is still relaxing and so very well done although at first it sounded as if I was watching an X-Man movie instead! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing in this documentary. At times: what you see is so real that you tend to forget that someone who has a camera actually was filmed all in that fun footage. <br /> In short: This is definitely a must-see for everyone since it worries every single person on this beautiful planet earth! Truth is: I never thought our planet was so amazing!
