First of all I would just like to tell this movie before that any of the recent crap that Hollywood cooked up from its bowels. McBain is a true and violent action movie that most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements in a late 80 / late action action film. The random acts of violence in violence (ie when Walken and crew go to confront drug dealers to get their money just show up and kill them rather than quitting they live and just take their money), the skater of course, the guys on fire, the guys who get blown up in buildings, and of course the guys in the fire that get blown in the buildings. Walken is at its finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, "let's go seated .......... out on the deck." and others make this movie a top purchase off of the clearance shelf at the local video store. if you have a bloody person for the random act of violence this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
