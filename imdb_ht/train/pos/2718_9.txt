Last year we were treated in two films on Truman Capote writing books from which this film was made - Capote and trampled. <br /> I can not imagine a movie like this being done in 1967. A strong, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a classic film by the mastery direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a warm tin floor, the Professional, Blackboard Jungle). It is interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this film, has had many problems late that may be related to painting it in a killer of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
