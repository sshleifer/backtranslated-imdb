Way back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA's firings and corporations began to shed their national identity, the United States and Japan were in the throat of each other in the global manufacturing race. Remember words like 'Union Yes!', 'The Japanese are taking this country off,' and 'Americans are lazy?' As the Reagan era went down and side corporations towards a global market, director Ron Howard has done one of several trips to the comedy genre and band Gung Ho '1986, which has drawn over $ 36 million in receipts office box office. While in many ways dating, Howard's lenght-in-weight history of collision culture in the workplace still offers true toughness for today's industrial life. Gung Ho 'focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the Automotive Republic of Singapore from Hadleyville, a small, depressed city at the foot of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to Toyota's real life), which is considering a US operation in the empty city. With hundreds of residents out of work with the town verging about thaw, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between official companies and workers on the assembly line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> madness of pride and trade union; On the other hand, Japanese workers are highly devoted to their work again lacking in personal satisfaction with self-worth feelings. In Stevenson, we find an American figure working in average intelligence and the skills of people's chat of misunderstandings. With survival of his workmen and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although his intelligence will plunge him into a great deal of trouble. In addition to the top response in Asan, we witnessed a delicate swinging act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro), and Paul (Ron Ron's Clint Howard). <br /> <br /> Throw the Japanese headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for 'Six Candles' and' Volunteers. 'Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who descends on its luck and begins to feel a sympathy for the American life. He is still shadow by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of CEO Assan who desperate to take his place in the pecking order. While providing a light touch, these ticket types are very good at conveying ideas into Japanese working culture. <br /> <br /> With Stevenson Hunt dominating the script, Michael Keaton has provided a solid performance for this movie at work. 'Gung Ho' is indeed a slam-dunk success for Keaton, who also associates Ron Howard in the 1994 'Paper.' She has been doing this film during a lighter role including 'Mother Mr.,' Beetle Juice, 'and' Dream Team 'before corporate in Batman,' A Good Copper, 'and' My Life '. It's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe's performance as the odd man, who first put it Japanese ribbon in shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the plant a self-contained unit. <br /> <br /> Throw in support is top-notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers provided a romantic interest as odrey, the girlfriend of the hunt. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babeloo Mandel were associated with writing solid Gung Ho. The assistant music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's music group is 80s wall-to-wall, including 'Do not Get Me Wrong', 'Tuff Enuff,' and 'Class Class Works.' The success of 'Gung Ho' actually leads to a short TV series live on ABC. While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard's movie still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Paramount and it is a short-change tad. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surrounded, English Dolby surround, and French 'doubling,' but the subtitles are in English only. There is no expense, not even the theater trailer. On the plus side, Paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sounds. While a few extra would have been useful - especially that 'Gung Ho' was a box office success - has little to complain about the film presentation itself. <br /> <br /> *** from 4
