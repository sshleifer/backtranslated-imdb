Grand Canyon falls under a very rare category: it is a very clever movie, with very clever dialogue and food to think everywhere from the end to the end. I have the impression that he never made it to him to deserve abuse (and never will), because of it's simplicity. This kind of flicker film sensitive sensors. Pity thought that IMDb made me write ten lines, because this is in no way necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to fill out this request, I'll tell you that the weak point in the movie if any of the act: not that it's bad, but it might have been doing better. Exceptions made to Kevin Kline were perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
