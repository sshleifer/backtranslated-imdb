Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary on a teenager (Weems) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, with her 11 friend who takes her on a cross-trip to see if "My Pimp My Ride" will pimp out his wheelchair. <br /> <I recently watched this film at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice on the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human spirit, and the spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say this often about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something towards the cause. Each movie festival took part in this film was a prize of some kind. It is at the Tribeca Film Festival, and it will be London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie goes all the way to the Academy Awards. It's snowballing out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever he plays, go! Take as many people as possible, and go! He is heading to New Orleans for a movie festival, then on Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I hope that the tickets for the Atlanta show will be sold out quickly, if not already. Please see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kich
