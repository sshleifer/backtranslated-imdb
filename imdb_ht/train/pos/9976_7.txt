Sure, it was cheesy and nonsense and at times lucky, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most TV films on the brink of substandard, this film actually has some kind of redemption. The film was very good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen shows shades of Aragorn in a movie about a man who played by his own rules. Most of the flaxback sequences were the type of cheese, but the scene and the mountain lion were intense. I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the movie as a rebel-jock shock, but then again, it's a movie movie! Despite all the good things, the band was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona evidently featured in the movie.
