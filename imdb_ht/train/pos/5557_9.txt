"A Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, faithful to the traditions, but with jokes of its own. It is hysterical, hilarious, very fun and quite fun. Artwork is in good quality either. This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he tries to catch the mouse too, because there is only one cat in this house in the morning - and that's the cat that catches the mouse. If you ask me, there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me, for example, when Mammy De Shoes sees the two lazy cats asleep and says sarcastically: "I'm glad you will enjoy the siesta" and that he hopes to be satisfied because he does not, making two cats gasp. Another funny wag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy two shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch doing the same trick in Tom. Of course that, even funnier than that, when the real Mammy De Shoes appears and both (mute!) Cats think they see each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack him on the "rear" lol. Of course that it gets mad and once it gets mad, it's not a mess. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he is also expelled.
