As a guy who has seen all seasons, I can say that JG is constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw his shifting from Paranoia Street immediately throughout the seasons and after every little gesture did u believe he's a criminal, u thought of yourself: OK he's a good actor and it can be found in a gangster skin. But after seeing him open his eyes and struggling for his life, I meant I could almost feel the pain he "did" we believed he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of the generations and even more. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando) and it's OK to make less movies and their performance is "lighter" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role. Can you recommend some of my older movies to a memorable performance?
