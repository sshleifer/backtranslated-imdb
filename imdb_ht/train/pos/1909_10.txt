I originally watched 8 simple rules on the Disney Channel UK for the first series and were fully tuned. When they did not show it any more \ was annoyed, but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series. I did not think another series would begin after I read John Ritter was dead, however the 2nd series was not surprising the latest series is back to his old excellent standard. I hope they go on to produce more shows soon though I could watch every show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character like Bridget Airhead and also makes the amazing charm. Rory is also good, he shares my name with Grampa as well. I will continue to watch it until it's finished until then I hope it brings on as funny as ever
