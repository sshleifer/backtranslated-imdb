Dumland focuses on one's life (American?) Family ... the father; a violent and obscene who loves fart and uses profanity and does not have any kind of redesign. Mother; who seems to be a paranoid psychologist, never really said so much. The son; an annoying dark repetitive little fellow. The animation is simple and simple, but it suits the stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available at the davidlynch.com website, but were now released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD with a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1- The Neighbors: We meet the neighbor next, and find out three things about it ... it has a really nice flow, Li There is only one arm and he likes to do things rogue and duck. <br /> <br /> 2- The Treadmill: We find that the wife has an exercise for exercise, but the husband does not really think it is a good idea. In the end, carpet exercises are victims. <br /> <br /> 3- The doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with a live exposure wire ... The doctor's exam is quite good (if not original), but the diagnosis is "you are perfectly normal "(but we knew that). 4- A Visiting Friend: After a new discussion with kick off the clothes, a friend comes to visit (Believe it or not, it's one! But after we meet it, we can understand why), there is no air surprise he tells us what his hobbies. <br /> <br /> 5- Finding the Stick: We meet another neighbor, she has a stick stuck in her mouth (although we never found out how she was). Unfortunately, remove the stick from his neighbor's mouth, became more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but it is victims at the end ... Jesus some people can be encouraged !!! 6. My teeth are bleeding: This was my favorite episode ... and it was also the most self-numbingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what to say about me ??). Not sure why the son's teeth began bleeding, but believe me when I say it was minimal in the plot of the story. Which is an oxymoron, as the story had no conspiracy. But there was a funny sequel (involving a fly) !! <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After uncle Bob Bob, with Bob's uncle, we find a distinct feeling that the Dumbland Youth-Pool is very deep. Uncle Bob is a sick fellow (I must not elaborate, to spoil it for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants in her family ... and the dad definitely ends up on the wrong side of his enough point (and spends the rest of the cowering visits to a tree in the back yard). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! hallucinating. The ants puts on a fabulous song and dance dance ... he goes berserk trying to kill them, wind up in a full bleach ... and allow just say, the ants finds revenge to the end. <br /> <As bad as such stories, there is something that keeps my compelling look to them. They give you another insight into yourself by one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of her violent thoughts ?? I was actually laughing at many points in the episodes. Many aspects are absurd funny !!
