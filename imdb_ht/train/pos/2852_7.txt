This movie has a very simple yet clever quote - a man who does not work trying to steal from a convenience store, and the store clerk captures it in the act ... the thief runs away with the store-right clerk after it. Throughout the time, the store clerk is in trouble with a low-rank chippo Yakuza (gangster). Along the chase for the thief, they catch the eye of Yakuza who was looking for convenience store clerk. The story then moves in high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse) but is added to the dog chasing after the cat. All the 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (they can be translated into English as "PINBALL ROUND") is on the chase, and the chase goes on & off to the point that at the end of the 2nd act, the bum wonder why it is running, and donation to Yakuza by Remember that the two men are chasing him, nor does he remember why they are running away from him. As with the later PAUSTMAN film pop art, the bulk of the movie is simply full of chore and action, and many physical comedy and black humor in the shot keeps the audience engaged. What falls short is the finish, in which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam, and in one of the most chaotic Mexican stands you will see on film that looks almost as if Sabu has paid homage to Tony Scott TREN ROMAN (written by Quentin Tarantino).
