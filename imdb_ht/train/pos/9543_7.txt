The Japanese cyber-punk movie never really made a whole lot to me, but in the handful of what I saw, most were at least visually interesting and at least especially fun. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. The scenario is about a parasite species that takes on human hosts, taking control of their bodies, turning them into "necroborgs", and causing them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game "for the fun said parasite. The film mostly revolves around a shy and gay guy who falls for each other, but whose love-affairs is cut short by both being infected with parasites and being forced to fight with each other. It becomes a test of people-vs. vices controlling the parasite on the physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINES will consistently be compared to TETSUO (as the most cyber-punk movie), and for good reason. There are definitely some thematic parables, though these movies are definitely different. There are plenty of fun, splattery moments in the MEATBALL car, and the beast / borg FX are definitely the highest point - a mixture of TETSUO-satisfying-GWAR that are both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for the types of films, MEATBALL car may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy cyber-cinema-movie punk movie with a healthy dose of splatter - that's for you ... 7/10
