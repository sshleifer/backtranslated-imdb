I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rent it over six years ago, and it still remains one of my favorite comedy. I'll admit, you probably will miss this movie if you do not know anything about the rap music. But if you're a rap fanatic, even one casual, you'll love the jokes inside and references. One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a **** and a ** h; I always use this line today and get lots of laugh with it. One of the best performances from Larry Scott, who played Lamar's nerd at 'Revenge of the Nerds'. It is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a DVD release.
