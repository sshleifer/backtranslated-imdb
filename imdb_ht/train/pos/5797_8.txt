And I do not say it in a bad way. <br /> I watched this movie in the movie when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousin it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it. During those years, I saw this film was revealed some times, but I always changed the channel. Even a few seconds in it would bring back that feeling of my magic and warm heart. And I loved it so. <br /> So I've only seen this movie once and I believe it was a good decision not to look it over again. If I've seen it today, I know I can not help but criticize MJ's act, the draw (if there was one) with this and that. For me this is a child memory, so my feelings are what's a child from 20 years ago. <br /> I see adult myself intervening in my rating, giving it a 8 for memory and wonderful music. For this little kid who watched her in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10.
