Wes Craven has created one of the most successful killer-thriller successes of all time. After watching it in movies, you will find your new fears. Those who do not know, that the movie Craven Wes Craven is the best, because they are all different. In this film, Lisa is terrorized by fellow traveler. He tries to kill and if he does not, Jack will kill his father. Lisa is in the great mess, because whatever she chooses will kill. <br /> <br /> Actress was real. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy act incredibly good. The emotions were in good choices. The idea and script of this movie are great too ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminds a "call", but it's definitely better, than both the "screams" suites together. What can I say - this is the best movie-chasing film in the 21st Century again ...
