This is an excellent, but difficult to find Trippy World War II spy thriller in Italian style unmatched to 60 years. From the psychedelic graphics to the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone in the lesbian and Capucine love scenes and elaborately produces the apocalyptic scenes of no one in battles with poisons and German jumper in full 'proof' storm trooper ', this is a movie that should not be missed. It is a movie that captures the horrors and cruelty of the war and the unforgiving of players on the battlefield. From the stage of battle, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie has been saved for the battle scene, but for lovers of the 60's movies it would not be a problem. The first time I saw this film on television many years ago and it was forecasting her tape on VHS. I still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
