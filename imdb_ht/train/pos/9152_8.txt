This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the finish was occupying this movie from higher reputation. <br /> It's injected into a rather naive fashion. This is clearly done to create a more feverish feel in the movie - a feeling of insulation becomes apparent very soon on due to this film's technique. <br /> <br /> The characters that were quirky very well acted and featured specially '' called Joe. However, the healthy characters (normal) are a little too pathetic for my taste - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT. The movie starts slowly (with naive camera smacks work in movie 'B' to begin with) and many virtually, but you soon get a feel of the next brutality that's about to happen. This is one of the most 'twisted' movies related to cold-hearted interiors. After ending suffering with my lazy incredible I left feeling shameful. I would have given the movie a 9 if the finish was in keeping with the rest of the movie but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'ceremony' and nail-skipping earlier scene of the movie. /> <br /> Give it a look and apologize to the finish!
