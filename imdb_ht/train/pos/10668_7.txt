As many evaluators here noted, the movie version is quite a bit from the stage version of the story. I have never seen the stage version of the story, and therefore I have a more favorable review of the movie than many other reviews. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for film directors, but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time of Michael Douglas' choreographer show. The movie does not right by choosing any famous actors or the wind performers up to the final try-out group. This is our attention focused on the movement of dancers and individual stories and their struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of trying-outs. Douglas is also probably not the best option for the party. Apparently, some songs were cut out in favor of a new one, and the hallmark-ridden hallway story of a romantic bond between a dancer and the choreographer added. I said in all that justice was the weakest part of the movie. Cassie's intrusions have been made during attempts-outs to appear in ice practice in desperation almost one often have to do when engaging in the artistic craftsmanship in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the movie was made to death in the past, and it's curious to see this tired old foot heels shoes up once again. The revelations of the dancers themselves began to promise enough with "I can do that" number, but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers told their story. Frankly, the stories are very small from real life that never gets a chance like this. *** of 4 stars.
