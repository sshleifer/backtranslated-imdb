Note that I did not say that it is better ... just more enjoyable. Lack of social commentary and realism help keep things moving. <br /> I was actually sort of surprised that this was not a Troma movie, as it has all the Troma brands, including sparkling acid fluids, wisecracks from the villain after every murder, a riotous rage scene (which is sort of difficult to be angry about, since violent is a snowman), and deputies. > <br /> 1. A snowman, on whom he noticed that he does not have feet or feet, drives a police cruise around the city. <br /> 2. Even if it is supposed to close in (or below) when it is freezing, show the sedans and there are no signs of car exhaust when running. The snow reminds you more of flaking or peanuts Styrofoam than the current snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A young girl gets the couple for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother gruesomely assassinated. He speaks of breaking into Sheriff's house, from all sides, in order to get it on. But first, he told him that he had built a beautiful fire in the fireplace and opened some wine. After Jake's children cut off by a drag runner, her father discussed with the sheriff about whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, had nothing to do with it. The Sheriff holds that Tommy would not have been fighting with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet higher than Tommy." At that time, someone in the background of the chimes, "Not yet!" <br /> 6. When this unfortunate snowman finally starts to dissolve away, the sheriff lites with a flat snowman made from some sort of cloth for an extended period. This is better than tarzan wrestling and rubber crocodile or gladiators struggling with stuffed bears. If I was an actor, I would not be able to hold a right figure at this point. <br /> In all, a fun movie. There are not really even lots of blood.
