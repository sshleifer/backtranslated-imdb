This film was made a few years later, I would give it a lower score. However, for 1909, this was a little dandy movie and still stands up pretty well today. Just do not try to compare this silent film later silently - the industry changed for radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century did not look at all movies like made in the 1910s and beyond. <br /> This film is 11 minutes long (roughly averages for most films back then) and is a variation in the story of Edgar Allen Poe, the CASK of AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with the story, I will not elaborate more as I do not want to break the movie. Just enough to say it's pretty crap !!
