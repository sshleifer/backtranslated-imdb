I was a little skeptical if I should watch this when it first showed on CBS. I was one of many people in NYC that day, I went to Hunter College. I did not want to see all the devastation and carnage again, but as much I was curious to see what was all about. Tears came in my eyes watching this documentary. All my memories back and just intense images were incredible. I bought the DVD on the anniversary one year and looked at it a few times. How could these guys get this foot was incredible? If you have not seen this documentary, make yourself a favor and check it out. It is obviously depressing and will bring tears in sight, but it's an incredible document in those worst countries.
