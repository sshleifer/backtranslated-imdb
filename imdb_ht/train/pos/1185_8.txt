Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger changed the goodie-baddie roles that were held in "All the Vital". Taylor looks a bit uncomfortable in his bad-roles but Granger plays his part perfectly. However the real hero of the story is the bizon and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, and the atmosphere at times gives nice. The direction is stiff and although the film has no light-hearted entertainment it is, in my way of thinking a larger movie, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti.
