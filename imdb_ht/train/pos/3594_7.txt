Michelle Rodrigez made this film, when I first saw her in the fast and furious. You can say that she was a hard woman. With this movie, he not only proves to act, but it shows no fear and is difficult as it should be in this movie. She is more a bad girl and that's what I love about her. This film is about a troubled girl, living the life as a tom tom and getting in constant trouble with the school and the family. As he becomes interested in training his brother to be a boxer, he decides to go after he loves his fight and asks his brother coach to train him. Even if they do not think it has the potential, they get to be shown to prove wrong. <br /> I think this movie was a bit slower at the finish, but it was well done. It shows, that people can do anything even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend it to see.
