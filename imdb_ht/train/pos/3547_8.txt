Interesting music where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to raise a floating toys game for his enthusiasts Sky Masterson to try and get salvation host, played by Jean Simmons, and Masterson in Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry." There she was sister Sharon and here he is Sister Sarah. Even temperament, different stories. Frank Sinatra is that demonic Nathan Detroit. She has been engaged in Vivian Blaine for 14 years and has abused her gambling habits. In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually made his own song here! > <br /> The movie is saved by Supreme Choreography. These people dance with the fabulous routines. They are specially accomplished by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice production.
