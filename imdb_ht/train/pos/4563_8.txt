Difficult to imagine this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle so heart-stirring. Daniel Day-Lewis is an argument, it's really hard to imagine how much he's been doing to create that disabled character. Watching him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. The film is not so pessimistic as I first thought, the story is kind of bright and intriguing. Christy does not despise by the usual, her life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the pains of her eyes. <br /> <br /> One important factor in Christy's success is to support her mother who seems to be more touched, and the unnamed actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this little fat middle-aged woman use it all to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what a performance for a child! The love story of Christy is very well-done, confident. Christy wants to love and nothing can derive her right for love, breaking her on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (amazingly played by Fiona Shaw, I deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter's series, lace Petunia Aunt, so Its appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoiac and offensive, I have sympathy for her, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and The agony is just next to each BTW, Jim Sheridan's works are true (in America, the box etc.) except GET RICH or Dead Try ', God knows why he chose to direct that crap! Really a fearsome career for her, what is mercy!
