The next things are a good Sci-Fi movie that shows a world imaginable, or "Everytown" in 100 years. You can break it up on 4 different scenes or parts. The film jumped from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this rule or the "Boss" wanted to get the ability to fly off aircraft again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out. There are about 3 pounds: it's audio is mud and video has some fad, the characters are not deep at all, and the overall plot is not all solid together. The plot miss something that I can not put my finger on ... it just looks a little "fluffy." But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H. G. Wells though can happen in the coming years, this is a must see. It's worth to see just to learn from what everyone was scared: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and had a threat to biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a very good movie that most people need to see once.
