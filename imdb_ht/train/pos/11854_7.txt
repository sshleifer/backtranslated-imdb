I agree with "Jerry." It's a very movie space movie (of course, how many good low-budget people do not mix?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not "rip-off") In 2001, because the computer controlled the container was actually a man, who somehow turned into a computer. Like HAL, they tried to disconnect her "spirit," but not mechanical part of her, and similar to HAL, she led to disaster. There are at least a funny moment. When the character Christopher Cary, who can not find any food, found the bird abandoned, there is a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing does not happen after all.
