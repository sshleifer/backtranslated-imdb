The first one took into account this time the film was made in. 1995. Rappers were in it, and added to the flair of it. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find her way and could not, until she met and was befriended by Nazi. They took it in. The Nazis are not all that awkward, but as most gangs, they file a missing miss that they must be economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the party perfectly. Omar Epps was the hot track star, with a doubtful work ethic and a chip on her shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his behavior, having his girlfriend and his right teacher out there. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she broke her date. Then he found his own experience with his sexuality, and politically involved. This movie deals with racism and love most things that deal with racism, personal perspective of playing. /> I read so many comments on how there was no 'evil' black character but there was evil White (Nazi). So, what? Remy was not described as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, he kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. She was frightened and sad to see her disappear as she did. He even said right before he killed himself, I did not mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! They both did not have any consideration for their roommates, and generally not like many white people. They were angry like the Nazi but they were not on the Nazi level in terms of overall wickedness. I'm sorry if that makes it seem unfair, but do you really have blacks like Nazi? No <br /> <br /> People say it's white = black bad = good. Not really, only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which are more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her companion (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, she was just misguided. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta have been seriously flawed characters, mad and inconsiderate. Although constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit seemed to justify her anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all movies that deal with racism, it's a great piece to get a discussion going. <br /> I do not think Cubes and Busta could beat the Nazis though.
