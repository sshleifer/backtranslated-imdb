The people claim their comic edited but they have to cut it down significantly in post production. I have harry as a current teacher in Ucsd, and honestly one of the best grades I've had, its rather funny here about what happened to make the movie cause harry is so animated. I originally watched the "joy of life" for another class where Harry had made a voice on the film, and he began to watch this movie after I started the class. Harry originally made some performance work, and it's really genuine about creating moments that move you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you hit the moment, but something you see in this movie.
