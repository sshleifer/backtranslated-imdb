I went to this movie waiting for a pair of artsy films. What I was scared after scare. He's a horror movie in his core. It does not dare like other horror movies where a haunting house just has ghosts and gurus. This movie does not even show you the majority of deaths it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its people who went into the house. They are haunting no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some of the external comments I'm really surprised that critics did not like this movie. I'll see it again this week and I'm excited about it. <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because he did so a horror movie should be. It's scary s ** t from me.
