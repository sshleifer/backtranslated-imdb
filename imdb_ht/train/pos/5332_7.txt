In light of bad reviews - or crash cars - I feel I have to get in gear and make a transit to merit where due and make a service. I'm not sure people have licenses saying it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> It's rare for a movie to have SUSPENS. This movie keeps its suspension in the whole length, for me, despite any flaw that can. How many films can this say? Not even a lot of people. Because of the simple quiz you do not know if people are getting out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the entire movie. Yes, the suspension was tight, and about some bumpy trauma they had done their job. It's not just a TV movie, but an all-action movie; There is no point where it is stopped, or particular, or come to talk. It would be difficult to make a movie like this, always on the road. Only duel, or speed, is that I remember. The best thing about them was also the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: The judge is as good as ever, and the others. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is a good thing. But the jury is out as if it sometimes can - or seem to be - a little curious. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. Your first trial is not always right, but I think the lead actor was allowed to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly terrific, especially for a TV movie. Only they can not be noticeable, and yet, apparent, slow down. But we all know how slow down the Grand Prix cars can look. <br /> I like that the BEGINNING said, "inspired by a true story." So you will not go how much is it? You know just the base is. Normal "based on a true story" makes me think it should be especially true. But maybe this is my mistake. <br /> HOW TO SAVE THEM: Good idea of ​​the review suggests a truck towing up the wheels back. Just a few inches would do. A suppressed driver could do this at 100 mph. The odds that they did not call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there's one way. <br /> I hope this revision is set to back that this movie is a disaster. Or at least not. And help it become a successful runaway. <br /> <br /> Best Pic is a little soft for a DVD .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been worn out after the baby was but weird that life-saving The mind was mischievous faced with some play conversations and made him lose. I guess we know why. End of movie. Suspension of disbelief from the top of the window and the baby.
