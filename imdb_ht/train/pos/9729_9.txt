Weak start, solid mid, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this movie, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I saw in the --- hot fuzz, and Shaun the deceased. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. Show her series as an actor, but however, I'm really a character character as she described in the beginning. There is a kind of humor I call "comedy frustration." It is supposed to be "joke" and understand that there is nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Much like the character Bean Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other actress actors that show similar characters. I do not mean to hit them here, so will not. But to be warned that if you are like me and you smarm smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows just the characteristics for the third third of this movie. It does better, however. <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's history stopped being annoying, and it became a triumphant type of "little guy" in the third final. I do not need all films to be sugar and light --- but haphazard, as this movie got better, it also started to be more and more to a happy end .... It was also a pleasure to seeing an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, plays a role as a mastery. I loved "Iron Man," but was sad by the fact that Brid's characters were a cruel one. Personal peppers taste, of course, as it acts in what was superb. However, it was a wonder here as the person older than life in vision, the publisher of Sharps. She was beautiful to see her in a role that I could actually enjoy. <br /> Overall, I liked it! I just wish I had come to 40 minutes late, and missed the start.
