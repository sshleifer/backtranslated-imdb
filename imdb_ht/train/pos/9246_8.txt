One of the great mysteries of life, suffers from everyday, is why beautiful girls so often are more interested in their neck and heels than the handsome handsome. <br /> <br /> Worse, when the lovely men even want to marry these girls, the girls still prefer the jerks and heels, even after the neck and heels have been shown to be despicable showed they're just interested in using the girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the lovely guy, who continues to be good after being deceived and cheated and even after she loses the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the jerk, and it is perfect in the role, rather a sad note to her fans. / / <br /> Jean Harlow comes across as a more slender Mae West, even sounding like La West in some of his cynical lines. <br /> <br /> A bit bitterness is that many of the other characters, intended to be bad guys - I mean, hey, they're locked, so they must - they're so obviously nice people. <br /> In fact, there are many lovely here, those who, in a less r movie or story, would snarling and back-knife, but here goes out of ways to help someone else. <br /> So perhaps the story is rather clich√©d, at least by modern standards, but ultimately viewers will be happy to have looked. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that many really good actors do not give credit. Again, we can say a fervent "Thank you" for IMDb.com.
