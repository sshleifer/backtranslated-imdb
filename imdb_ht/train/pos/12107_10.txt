I saw this movie as a kid on Haitian Creole Feature when I lived in New York. It was a beautiful movie to climb, but not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it's different from what I remember because of the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and / or Italian and there is no translation given. Then other actors responded in English to what was being said. Strange kind. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors spell similar to IMDb. Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes and gives a naked shot of one scene and another Julia scene trying to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele ) to get out with him by pushing him down to the bed and kissing him while Steele resisted. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra foot that might be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these classic old low budget have been reinforced by bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the meter and foot taps used? Aside from the first twenty minutes of boring before Allen is released from the Castle, the rest of the film is very good. There is not much special effect (but Herbert's face after Julia's club is good). The creepy atmosphere and look of the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele makes the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had never been in this film, it would be a big zero. He made the film ten!
