Ice Age is not just animation of the Year (in my eye) it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The teaser excited me last year and I spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is cool! So, the rest of the target heroes is zero. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb. Your heart really goes out of the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say that one really stole the picture. <br /> I have travel experience with laughter, tears and wonder. Nothing has been forced or done. The emotion was genuine, especially in the second half of the drama. The last movie affected me was deeply Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before that it was the Land before 1988. All possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
