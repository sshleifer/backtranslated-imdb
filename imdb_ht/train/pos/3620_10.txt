I just saw the movie tonight, night opening. It was very good !! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was just up there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and it was supposed to buy a drink once ... well .. It's kind of got you ... but it did not mean! C) [not that anyone will believe that ...]) ANYWAY, it's a great movie. Everyone who loves a good sports movie, should go out and see it! : C)
