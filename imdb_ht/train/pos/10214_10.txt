For me, this review may include crowds, but I love watching movies that have no idea of ​​what's going to happen, so I think so much of the other comments here in this movie have including crowds! <br /> I just watch this movie again, and I must repeat that it has the best to finish in any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The real translation, 'Bat in the Butterfly Wing', is unusual to use as the title translates. I think they thought most Americans did not know which Chaos theory is (except for those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The movie is based on chaotic theory, and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event. The movie is a whirlwind of beautiful cause and effects, as we follow the chain of chaos as it interrupts between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the finish looks inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it's a perfect finish. Think of yourself, "what else must you say"? It is at the same time a very brave finish. Too bad we must go abroad for a gem like this one, but an end like this would never come from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
