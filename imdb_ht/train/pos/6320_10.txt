The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. One ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing and out to actually see it. But this movie keeps me off guard. It was not what I was hoping at all. It was a while since I saw it but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not just the cast that made it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you expected something happened it did not happen. There were many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming in as firefighters. The cinematography, along with the series, was absolutely beautiful as well. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Expedition, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen!
