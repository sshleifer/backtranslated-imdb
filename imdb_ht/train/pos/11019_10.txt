Cliffhanger is what seems to be Slyvester Stallone's latest film actress before becoming such an underrated actor. It's about a mountain climber that must help his friends after being held hostage by mercenaries who want to find three suitcases carrying more than $ 100 million. It has great action sequences, corner of your seat fun and a great time in these films.
