I only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five and looked it up until I was seven. Then I got older and calculated Full House could wait and that I had "most important" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that younger brothers who looked at her faithfully with me for the two years began to flu she thought she was too "girly." <br /> Then I realized every afternoon of five it was about 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how beautiful it would be if our world was like the World of Full House more a mother. I heard people say Full House is cheesy and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. Sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. Three men and women can be found at bickers at times. What's any more real than that? <br /> If there is nothing to show up me when I came down and brought me even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I was groaning like an eena in the show and became a massive obsession on Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff now takes this place but they were literally the cutest babies I've ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)
