This was a very decent movie. This film is a good thing to sit and watch and to be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never have an Oscar or anything and definitely does not deserve one, but I thought it was very good. It's kind of like the 24 show but put in movie format. If you like the whole we had to stop the terrorist from killing the movie's films then you'll enjoy this movie flick. I personally think scenarios that have made way too much, but the Sentinel adds a bit of twist and the mole of the Secret Service. All of this, this movie will not let your jaws on the floor or change your life, but that every single movie should do like what to be good?
