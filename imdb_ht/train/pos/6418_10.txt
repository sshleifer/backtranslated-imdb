I liked this movie. It is a definite inspirational film. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rental or purchase worth. It should be at home ever. Best movie I've seen in a long time. It will make you angry because everyone so means Carl Brashear, but in the end he gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action, and many funny lines to keep you hooked in. I love a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me from doing what I want to do. It shows that anyone can realize their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long film, but every time I look it, I've never noticed that it is as long as it is. I find that aggravate in it, that it goes so fast. I like this movie. I watch it every time I can.
