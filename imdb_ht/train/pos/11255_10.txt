This is undoubtedly my favorite Le Carre novel and it is transformed into the silver screen with all the love and care one might want for. I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters slowly but I believe this is missing the point. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Trespass is the key not everyone for the good of nobody. Pym breakout is so close to my own that I find it watching. Peter Egan is in his finest role, and late crying Ray McAnally is unbelievably good. Even the smaller roles are played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are stunned. This cast is a Dream Impresario Theater. The story should not be spoiled by ill-informed description, but suffices it says it relates to a slow but inexhaustible destruction and descent of espionage and betrayal. All of my sympathy is with Magnus Pym and salt (not sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang-as wonderful as always ... His only true friendship, but also by definition another in the long line of betrayal. Extension! Rent it, buy it.
