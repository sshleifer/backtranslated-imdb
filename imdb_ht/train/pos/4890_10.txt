Superb dropping, more please! If you can catch just anything else written by Plater (or start those wonderful actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a real feeling for jazz, my recommendation is seeing trilogy 'Beiderbecke' whenever you can. "There are three types of jazz - hot, fresh and what time does the music start? '"
