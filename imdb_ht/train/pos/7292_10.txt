I saw this just last Friday at the Los Angeles movie festival in Laemlee on Beverly. This movie got the most applause of all these evening films. Considering that two open music videos first, I did not know what to expect since they were very fast and careful grabbing, I did not make sure I was ready for a short instant. But in my surprise I really liked this. I thought the main evil guy is actually good. I was so impressed with her performance that I checked her name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade guy. It has gotten really good especially since then! Either either he or she has been devastating or has been pushed by the director is really difficult for this short one. The girl did a job okay. I guess it's been hard since its first performance and being so young. The father did well. There was a lot of real cg work for a short, both for this and the next short play "Mexican Hat" that was also nice, but I loved this much because it had the most depths and emotions with me actually cares about the character. The other was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and black! He faced real issues using a more fantasy like approach to maintaining ADD people like me interested. We will not even talk about the latest movie in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I only want to see more of the demon character and a little less of getting started, which is why I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought credit to end up a little slowly. Otherwise it was very well said, directed and edited. The weather was very nice and a complete change from the MTV editing was fast over everything nowadays. There will be more coming from this director of the future as well as the actor. I now think of him as the perceived actor paired by the Witchblade guy.
