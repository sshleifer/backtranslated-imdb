The movie rosenstrasse film rubber is the best movie I've seen in the years. I'm actually not really interested in film and historical background, but with this he's got my interest for that time !! <br /> <br /> Only the annoying thing about the movie being the scene in New York, and the impression was "trying to be as American as possible" ... that I think has absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the back really got to my heart. The German actress Katja Riemann has fully deserved his award. She is one of the most impressive actress I've ever seen. In the future I will look more in his movies. great luck for me that i am a native German speaker =) and only for a year in our, so as soon as i am back i will buy some riemann dvds. <br /> <br /> so all out who has not seen this movie yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it might be too long to describe what it's all about again, especially all the flash backs and switches at times are difficult to explain, but simply watcxh it, you'll be zesty !!!!!!!
