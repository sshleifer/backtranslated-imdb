Dark remedies are a plain and simple home. The film is full of visual creepy, and crises that will make the most seasoned veteran veteran straight from the chair. Stages of stairs in particular, these guys are good. Although they were not working on a big budget everything everything looks good, and the actors come in. Staying black has one of those terms that can be negative for some, but I guess it makes you think. Cheri Christians and Greg Thompson are stunned as the couple trying to rebuild their lives, but some side characters like the sheriff did not convince me. Not all that is important anyways. I give black a perfect ten evaluation of being ten times scarier than any recent history of recent studio / Japanese notes.
