Fascinating Downer on a New York City hustler would be forced to live in a condemned and disabling building. Extremely weak examinations of modern-day moral and social decline, well-directed by Jan Schlesinger (never tackled his work here) and superbly acting by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Pack quite a punch in general, again "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for a chuckle - they are mildly intrusive, as are the party's "fashion" drugs. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, but filmmakers are careful not to get boiling, and this gives the picture a corner it might not have had with a director less than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, and the winner of the Best Photo Oscar; Scenario Waldo Sell (adheres to James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 from ****
