If Jean Renoir's first film "Whirlpool of Fate" first takes us into the world of the country, the rivers, the lives of the peasant that he continues to explore, looks like fitting that his second film deal for the most part and rich The privileges, upper classes and those who try to claw roads are equal. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the pills in his great "grand illusion" and "The rules of the game." This is very well-filmed, with the restless camera making complete use of the amazingly large and slim apartments that dominate the film's interiors, and the act though often overwrought offers some great moments as well, particularly in Muffat Werner Krauss'. But the celebrity and hot celebrity Hessling, who first appeared as if he could give Louise Brooks a run for his money in vampires, never go beyond a single note, selfish whore portrait. Maybe this is partly a problem with the script, which seems to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; No read the novel I'm not really clear about whether the choices were well-done or not. Still, the difference between Nana's pretender is well-traced, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo Vandeuvres - the tragic understanding that each seems to have in his ultimate fate and their sympathies with each other, particularly at the stage at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder whether violence will erupt - this and other gleanings in the ridicule of the idol rich help to film in the depth it has. As far as his greatest success, and for me it's just the shyness of the "Whirlpool of Fate", this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or people who are interested in silent movies generally .
