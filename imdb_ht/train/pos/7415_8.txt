How powerful and fascinating simple quality can be. This film tells its story and everyday scenes that managing the poignancy revelation to hide from. It's true as others have stated, how this film really makes it really obvious how Hollywood's lost is in its special emotional, emotional and ongoing thermal climatic effects and has forgotten the essence of a meaningful story that has been said and simple realism . So much of what these characters going across is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialog. An aspect that I really liked about the movie was the contrast between the two brothers, one so openly expressive in the way its kids and the other were completely stoic but both could evoke mournful emotions. The older brother needed to say little, as he usually did, he was all there in that face dropping from it! Beautiful movies, wonderful, great direction! Do not be missed!
