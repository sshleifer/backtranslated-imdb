Election is a Chinese movie, or triads in this case. Every two years is an election that was designed to decide on a new leader, and first, he looks like a launch between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, "Tony Leung's Other") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was Judge in full contact!). Though once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes on as long as it can secure recognition as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian film I watched gangsters present, this one is not an action movie. It had its bloody moments, when needed, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There's a lot of characters, which is really hard to keep track of, but I think playing in the craziness of it all a bit. A 100-year-old baton, which is the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes several times before things remain. Though it may appear that the film ends in the 65 or 70-minute mark, there are still a couple of great surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and the sort of picture anchor. Election was the premier winner of the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning for Best Leader (Tony Leung), Best Photo, Best Director (Johnny Pou, Who was Heroic Trio !!), and Best Scenario . He also has been nominated for cinematography, editing, film scores (which I liked), and three more acting performances (including Yam).
