Went Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I had made a bad buy or a good one. It is the result later in viewing me the whole movie from the beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, gave a great performance and looks nice, sexy, and at the same time a real study of the art of how act is really done. Diana did not love her home life and especially her father for abuse he gave her mother. She decided to find boxing training at a Brooklyn Gym location and she was not really accepted by the male boxers. In high school he has a lot of friction between his female peers and men. There are many actions in the bathroom toilet and referral as private parties to guys. If you like boxing, and see a sexy hot gal does the wonders of the ring and hit the boys on them you know what, this is the movie for you.
