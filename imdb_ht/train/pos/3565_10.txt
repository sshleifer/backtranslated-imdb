Guys and Dolls are a unique game based on their characters. Sky Masterson <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a senior gambler who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for one-thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can <br /> run his usual game and make a fortune. The bet was that sky could not just take any girl in Havana, Cuba and the "doll" she chose was Sara <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) was in charge of a missionary. Sky finally bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with her. They ended up falling in love with each other, but later accused him of something he had no part. Nathan runs a crap game of missionary the night they have gone. Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) 14 year-old fianc√© Vivian Blaine does not agree with Nathan's gambling and tries to stop her from doing it. However, when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double <br /> <br /> marriage. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no voice singing at all and true they could dump him, but he did not really matter. He did a nice act (obviously seen as it's Brando) and played his character very well. I saw a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this film was weaker and he could not <br /> sing all at all. However, the song was made by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine, and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original <br /> Broadway production of guys and dolls. Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you love music, and even if you do not, I advise you to watch this.
