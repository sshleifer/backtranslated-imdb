There is this private campaign in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has been around since 1959. My grandparents were among the founders, my parents had a site starting in 1965, and two brothers have the site right now. This has nothing to do with the movie; bring with me.) <br /> I spent summer in Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old when I was eighteen and it was people like me who this movie was talking about: that a group camp in the woods was, as my fiance said to me, "the place is good and happy." If you have never experienced the shape, American summer will probably be lost on you; Do not bother. It's not quick-paced, it's not quick cut, the cemeteries are not in the least bit entrenched, it's no explosions, such as dramatic tension as existing is mild, no A-list actor, there is no quick - Smoking smokes just the show how smart the scriptwriters are (other than, perhaps, killer Kimberley Williams line on how her fiance would not "hinder her toys." That's not the least of this film , any more than the godfather is a flicker slasher movie just because it has a lot of grenades screen. <br /> <br /> But American summer is opposed to the godfather polar. If you've experienced the shape, watch the movie that's it anymore, just do it. <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
