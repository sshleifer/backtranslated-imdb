This is an honest attempt to make a love love slowly. The obvious inspiration behind the TV series "Avec," this sweet sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. The obvious comparisons. jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid "straight." kim novac plays a lurid blond witch who captures it in the use of a love spell. but then checker broke by a stronger witch, read what's in itself with the duties of running his own store and taking comfort in the fact that his beloved pyewacket (he's familiar feline) is being cared for by tents his dear morning. you will recognize the aunt from "Kill Death by Death." This movie is fun and touchingly sweet, brings some spectacular wit and a wonderful witchy feel. worth a look.
