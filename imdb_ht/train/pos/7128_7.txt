This is arguably finest Jan Thaw's performance where he successfully shakes off any feature of his Morse Inspector character and brings a perfect adaptation to Tom from the pages of the book on the TV screen. This is a well-done production that keeps his family vibrant seeing despite some mature terms such as the epidemic of the Second World War and the physical abuse of the child. <br /> However it is the relationship between Tom and Young Willie who is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young evacuated from London and the old muddy man he left and developed - a real grandfather's connection / son. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this story was not made with a larger budget and a more established director as it belongs to the big screen, not showing once or twice every ten years a Sunday afternoon. Given the right direction, Jan Thaw should celebrate the world with so many and many awards for its brilliant performance in this film. A great actor with a great role that should honor more than he was at the moment.
