I just recently watched this on the Sundance Canal. The idea for the film has brought many filmmakers, illustrators of their own country, making short films, eleven of them, all in one movie, focused on one topic: September 11. <br /> From Wacking to This Movie could say why these filmmakers were great in their country because he had all the elements of a big movie. The film starts off with a movie from Iran in which a literary teacher teaches students about what happened to September 11 that they fail to realize until later. <br /> <br /> The second movie in France involves a deaf woman who writes a letter to her lover in anger while she is unaware of what will be as the TV plays. The next film from Egypt involves the film itself talking to a dead soldier on recent events not only about terrorists in 9/11 but bombings in other places. next from Bolivia to which a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they must walk for them. Next comes from a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man who believes they are Bin Ladin. The next from Mexico in which nothing is shown, but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> In the future of Israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report, but is often told about the attacks. <br /> There are other films that I can not remember at the moment but all of them are powerful. It will bring back your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
