We're so often talking about Landmarks Movie - Kane, the Godfather, A bout of Souffle. A movie is too often overlooked by critics of "serious" films. I talk about classes on Savage's classic doc (M.o.B.) <br /> This film is not only interesting, but also seriously exploring the problem of exploitation in developed countries by US imperialists. Not to mention kung-fu. <br /> It also owns the greatest band in film history (until the Queen's magnificent performer on Flash Gordon). Although a bit of a rarity, this movie is well worth looking - it will pay your search efforts to ten-fold.
