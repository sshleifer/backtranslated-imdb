It's just like being happy to watch this intriguing project. So refreshing and educated. Not only in a cinema, who can learn what can be achieved within 5 minutes of screen time, but also as audience, who may not be so ready for beloved in this short time. <br /> <br /> 20 Short Films on Love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was better, although the mimics made me smile inside the same. I click on the "bus" opportunity of this bus review ... it's a beke enough. Just watch it. Do not read what I write, but watch the movie instead. <br /> And smile.
