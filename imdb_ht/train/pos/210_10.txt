Two great comedies in a big movie Neil Simon based his hit plays. <br /> <br /> Great combinations, especially when the comedy in question are Matthau and Burns. Little wonder why Burns had an Oscar for that; It is as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau is every bit matching it, if a tad more crotchety. <br /> <br /> This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners meet for a special TV but still can not stand with each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to watch these two choose from each other, performing together to make this movie an absolute fun. My head, I especially enjoyed "hit, hit, hit / enter!" scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll enjoy it, too. <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the entire movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
