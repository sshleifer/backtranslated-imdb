I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steam Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a movie from 1968? I was prepared for deception. But when I realized she was shot entirely in black & white, I knew her erotic was shooter. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of a romance steam - the first discovery of love, fear of the secret found out, an unexpected sudden end - but at times this film was outright erotic. You will soon forget that it is injected into black & white. The cinematography deserves every reward he has received over the years. And their performance from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) is intense and memorable. OK, so they're both in the noon wont trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect genes from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women have always tried to go to attack with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teen here is waiting too much. <br /> I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The erotic level was an unexpected pleasure; yet he still managed to leave a lot of the imagination, choosing instead to give us poetic descriptions added to what we have shown. <br /> I have no eastern debt being identified with the characters here. As for you right guy who loves watching lesbians in action: Although it will not be all you expect, I do not think you'll be too, too disappointed.
