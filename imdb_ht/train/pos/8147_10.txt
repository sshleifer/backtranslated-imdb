Fearing in a black hat is a hilarious parody of Hip-Hop culture. It's just as funny as this is Spinal rug, if not funnier. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should begin in a lot more film. This movie is a true classic cult!
