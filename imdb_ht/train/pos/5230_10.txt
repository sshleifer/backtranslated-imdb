Actually I liked this movie very, very much. Not because of it's draw, act, joke, no. I love it, because it's one of the worst movies ever created. It`s so lame, so bad, that it gets terribly funny. Some jokes are actually cool, but the rest makes me cry for the scriptwriter. The "white man" are so dumb and stupid, that you can do only two things. Turn the TV or roll over the street floor (beer helps much :). I chose the second option.
