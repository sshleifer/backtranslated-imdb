Every time I watch this movie I'm more impressed by all the output. I came to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; script, act, direction, sex and correction. Also James Stewart can always count on for a good performance, and cast into the magnificent supports, she is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was. It's tragic personal life to give it a sense of poignancy as a scene where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best. Look for the number of scenes made on one captivating - breathtaking.
