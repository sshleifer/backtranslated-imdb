FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of the Hollywood SF films. The influence he felt was over a decade. However, certain elements related to how this wide-screen entertainment has been targeted at an audience of fifty fifty who now has its date quite a bit, and sometimes bogus it does not help. But the compelling idea of ​​the central story involving the former, external Krell civilization and the "Monsters of Id" did not lose its appeal and continue to make this movie a "film" important movie. What I'm especially interested in saying here is that the actual DVD for this movie is terrible. The movie never really looks good on home video and its elements in dire need of restoration. I hope this will happen soon and we get a special edition of this classic SF.
