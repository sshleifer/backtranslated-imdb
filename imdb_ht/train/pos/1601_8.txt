It is quite a simple but not very active, but very good movie. There were moments in which I could see why Cher won Academy Award for Best Actress, but there was another time when I asked why Glenn Close did not have Fatal Attractions. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe have won, with BAFTA nomination Cher playing Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low paying job requested by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry her. He promises he will be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so it means while they need to get as much of his family to go to the wedding as possible. Only problem is when Ronny finds Ronny one-butless Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and there is love going on that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also begins Oscar nomination Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe have Olympics Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. He ends up having no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but Ron and Ronny were happy together. He won Oscar for best writing, Screenplay written directly to the screen, and was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Night's Night) and best photos, he was nominated for the BAFTAs for the best score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated Golden Globes for Best Movement Movements - Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("Snap Out of It!"), It was number 17 in 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Really good!
