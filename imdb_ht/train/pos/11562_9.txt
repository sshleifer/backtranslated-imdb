I simply can not find out how brilliantly apparently in Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's like the movie does not even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two. Lemmon has already been in well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and the apartment with Matthau was cool at Oscar for the Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie with Lemmon). This particular film was not as great as this one because the story could not sustain such a long running time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this goes through a hush hour and a half, though the introduction of events leading up to Lemmon ending in Matthau's apartment is a long tad (so was this sentence). This is a little tacky though and for the rest of the time runs you have a wonderful time. <br /> I've already written a comment on how follow-up this movie saves and I will not go deeper into that. The reason is such a joy is that the movie was made just as innocent in the American cinema began to wither soon in oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are faced with an innocent way that you could not even get a "Well, I never ..." from most prudish people out there. It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long period of time lost and that was probably why the end did not work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say well some f-words and that just do not fit them. > <br /> Of course, now they both go and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a wonderful movie like this. I think the male actor in this movie is still alive John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So have you got it. Simply one of the best comedies and films ever. <br /> Add: I just learned recently that John Fiedler had died for all the fans of him I am deeply sorry. I did not mean any disrespect and I will try to be more aware of what I blah blahing next time.
