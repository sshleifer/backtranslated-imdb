Documentary of this type are often very input. This film seems to take everybody out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad that the poor people have to work, this movie does a great job to show the ugly side of sweat shops. The Mardi Gras film: Made in China was a great way to show the world how something like petty as a celebration for a celebration can effect the lives of many in another country. <br /> I watched this movie for an English class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this movie helped get the rolling topic. It was a great, very informative movie and I would recommend anyone to view it, it's just opening your eyes.
