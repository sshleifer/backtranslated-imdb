As a kid I remember being nine or ten and liked this movie. It was all round the Bollywood action / movie comedy. It's an imitation boy boy obviously! All the identities swapped but the arrival of other twins thrown everything out of the window and then came to colorful villains that danced with songs! Scenes of action in the film are not revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The film is really very funny and the great Amitabh Bachan comeback needed need. Govinda is a gem like ever and this is probably best work it out on date, it shines as the nd shooter delivers the best comedy scenes available in American cinema. <br /> <br /> Singing .. The songs are both funny and enticing .............. prove laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan amazing is Very funny and will make you laugh as 'Miah Bade' .... accent her ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Asi chutki naab re daal' se The Best Song .............. Hilarious.
