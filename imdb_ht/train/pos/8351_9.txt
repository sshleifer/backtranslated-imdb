I remember walking hiking in Spain at 25, getting a lift from, what turned out to be from Italy's little crooks. They did a great deal outside of the law, but on the other hand brought a little portrait of Jesus in the pocket for their protection ... Just and unfair, good and bad, criminals and incorrect places here in a new combination , out of the category I knew. 'Valseuses' give me, although a movie and not real life, a picture close to my own experience: the intensity of every moment as soon as you leave 'all behind' and go for the moment, whichever comes way you, it's another state of mind and also 'dangerous' form of life, because, as we all know, there are those who are not ready for this and want to persecute you for 'robbery' and so on ... This The movie touches its 'value' into a story about 'right and wrong': moral. It's the resurrection of the person to fight himself free against the 'false false' and conformism ... There is danger all the way because, how far can you go with your own 'freedom' and cross your own on the borders and what are there other people? What to do with people who want to hurt you, put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do, such as "stealing" some petroleum from a multinational oil company for your fifth hand machine? The Valseuses re-raise the questions in me, because morality, in the contradiction of the usual 'message media', is quite complex.
