And I'll tell you why: anyone who decides to edit this movie makes it suitable for television was very ill-advised. All drug tips are cut and covered UP !!! How to do it, would you ask? Well, they do not do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana that Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they say they have diamonds! Still, the characters go into a maze of marijuana smoke off others on their way with no explanation too!
