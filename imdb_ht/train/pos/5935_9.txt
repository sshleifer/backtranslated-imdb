After seeing the terrible, terrible, awful stick: THE END END I knew I saw this as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Press play to see the trailer I thought I was in for another horrible shortcut from what far-look like another movie movie wannabe wannabe trying to bring new depth into a character already exists. But was rather welcome and a GREATLY set trailer for a movie that sadly does not exist, as I would like to see a movie completed even though it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST make up for BATTLE: END END and then some. <br /> I look forward to the next short!
