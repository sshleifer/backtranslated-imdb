What does not like about this movie? Every year you know that you will find one or two yulet film manure during Christmas time and most of them will be awful. This movie is definitely a new new idea that has been pulled beautifully. A very funny take on a young rich guy pays a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What good has money like this if you can not do fun with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a wealthy guy gets Christmas experience as he imagines. Only if. <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was extremely difficult to deal with and was just a riot to see reluctant relatives to comply with his absurd quest. It was a fun and funny movie.
