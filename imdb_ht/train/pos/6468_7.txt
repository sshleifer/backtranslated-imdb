This is a very OK movie ... yes some parties are lame and exceptionally practical, and the film does not really justify cast in big stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here is Home Housewith (not to be confused with the singer KK). At the scene where she first met Amitabh's character, I thought that a man could just look at AB, keep pace and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved himself worthy of Sarkar, with AB for a second time. This guy should get more roles, it is brilliant. If you read any of the other comments here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry to Pakistan was a little too easy. And the little love story he shared with "what-he-figure" was completely needed. But it's a fairly good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to look, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm my biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. <br /> An interesting look, consider it in Bollywood, although somewhat inspired by Hollywood old as the "Great Escape" and "Bridge over the Kwai River".
