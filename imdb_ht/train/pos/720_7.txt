Just imagine what schools might be like in a world like this: The kids are one big gang that has really delicious music and unites against bad guys and teachers. Rock 'n' Roll High School "is taking place in the world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. Characters are all comical, innocent and spacious as the Ramones' songs, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. High school comics have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" and this classic late 70's, where no sexless jokes are made at all. Since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost on the road and will be replaced by vulgar, half-comic joke dick, like Bill Hicks used to call them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones PAs must be replaced. The perfect group for this movie and anyone else could even come close to taking their place. So the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, as original and spacious as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
