An amazing one. One of the best musical ever. The three busbyby numbers that end up the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie is wonderful is incredible Fatherland that does not stop with the natural act of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also nice, though he may not have been a great actress). There's a freshness in the movie that you do not see in today's flicks, much less of these films usually save 30s, even though the plot, which involves the environment of movie prologue, is well-dated.
