Never seen this movie in 1971 and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and the creation of great animations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played an outstanding role as a woman who took a course in witch witch and was an apprentice who started flying on a broomstick and was quite a few difficulties to take. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed trip in different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to become a accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the one who sells Eglantine this neck of magic and tries to help him in every possible way to find his solution. Eglantine has a goal of his frenzy, it is stopped by the Nazis from avoiding England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
