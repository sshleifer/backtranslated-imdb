Things coming is a historical film. Together with Metropolis (1927), he stands as one of the first major science fiction bricks. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the Second World War in one year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. But then the film came out of reality, describing a world ravaged by war (only replacing gas poisons for nuclear weapons that of course did not exist in 1936). The last hour of the last movie is an incredible eye, made inaugural use of patterns and paintings later - become staples in genre of science fiction. It is sad that, after things come, sci-fi would become identical and cheap to make b-cinema, a stereotype that should not be broken until 2001: A Space Odyssey over 30 years later. If they would stick to the quality of the effects of this movie, things were very different in Hollywood. Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this movie, in good effect. Massey plays a great "Doctor Who" - as a role as a pilot from an advanced civilization (for 1970) that tries to win over the population of a devastated country led by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson ). Finally, the storyline covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this movie - there really is not a cinema itself. Maybe in such a episodic film - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, actually - it's hard to have a conventional plot, but I felt more could be made of the material, and although the visuals of the final third of the picture are true Stunning and worth the price of admission ... The plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends as it is becoming interesting. Perhaps the producers thought of another science innovation in the future: an end? <br /> <br /> Things to come is a movie each serious sci-fi should see at least once. Unlike metropolis, however, it would not be repeated.
