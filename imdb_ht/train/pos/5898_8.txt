Penny Princess found the American girl working Yolande Donlon erotiter in a small kingdom lying in triangles where France, Italy, and Switzerland encountered Lampidorra. It seems as if Lampidorrans to be billed all over Europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can get titles. His closest mistake is Donlan. But of course the estate goes to Probation in America and what are the Lampidorrans doing? Especially since Donlan has now become a princess was forbidden smuggling. <br /> Include Dirk Bogarde who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It looks as if the Lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as Schmeeze. With a few bumps on the road, Schmeeze resolved all the problems both financial, geopolitical, and romantic between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How Schmeeze works, wells of gadgets in the entire movie. But here's a hint. In Lover back Jack Kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of Schmeeze when he was busy inventing VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. Anyway, Penny Princess is a delightful mix of British mashed and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would throw in if the film was made this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was thoroughly dropping into the party that was at the start of his career as a romantic heart vibrant, way before anyone but his suspicion that he was the current chop he had. <br /> This film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
