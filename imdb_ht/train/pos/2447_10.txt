George Lopez has never kept my interest in standing up his comedy and still does not. But this show is a work of art. It never shows where jokes are kept laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that are memorable in that). Show this just to have an optimistic look at it and the characters vary from an old, short drink to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who wrote this show but that person does a good job. If they were just continuing to show me if he would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! One bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine the cool Prince of Bel-Air being "Will Smith". C'mon people! But otherwise, this show is genius! 10/10
