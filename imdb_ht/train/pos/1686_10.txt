After a week long hard behind the office to make all those damages decision serious this movie is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio radio this movie will take you to a country of foreign humor and paradise sci-fi. Captain Zippo died in the great charge of the Buick. He was a brave man. Nicholson's impressions Jack shines right in that foreign face with dark sunglasses and leather jackets. And always remember to beware of 'donuts of death!' Keep in mind a rule number of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'Prepare to die Scum Earth!' You just have to see it for yourself.
