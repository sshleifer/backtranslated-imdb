But the rest of us, who love a sentimental and emotional story that is a lock for you to cry .. enjoy! Tom Hulce is beautiful as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling with his brother Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works very long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of time and tends to appeal to doubtful judgment. She really just wants a good boy, doing what's right, and making her brother proud of her. She stopped at church prayer at one point and expressed her emotions openly and well that the character you wept before the damn movie even came really started. <br /> It's not about to give anything away here but the movie is very involved with sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of things will have a garden day with this beautiful story, its love characters and a great song I can not cite here, which has nothing to do with the movie at all but Strange proper .. but you hear it in a bar I think Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since it was for 'Amadeus' I figured that would give him the track inside actually have. No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then it later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much of a party here but she's nice to read her name in a small set of Pittsburgh series about two brothers you have never forgotten.
