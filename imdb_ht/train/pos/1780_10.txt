My mother and I were on our way home from a trip to the North East (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to take a look at a movie festival in Boston. Now I do not know much about film so I thought this might be a bit educational. The first movie we saw was this one, the ROMEO division. Now I do not know about you but I thought this was great! I'm from Texas and where I from you do not see too much motion picture so this was a nice surprise. My mother insisted he was too violent, but he said I did not know much about what he said but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the battle sequences were great. Also, I'm a big fan of good guys so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. It was true brightness. I'm not sure when it's getting video upload but if you get the chance you should check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word that is wise though, it is rather violent and there are so many Cuss words that you do not want to let your child look. It's more for adults.
