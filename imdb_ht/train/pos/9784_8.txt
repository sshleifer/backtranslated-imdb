Sensitive films lack shine and, at some degree, narrative structures, but are nevertheless superbly injected and performed. However, the point of narrative structure is debatable. While it gives the tidal impression of the loose nicely into the final scenes and connects its thoughts and what can be described in the modern viewer as a "story", I'm skeptical as to whether this feeling * needs * a " narrative structure "that is definitive and detected. Inevitably, it will be compared to somersault in its central protagonist (I'm not sure what's the correct word!) It's a young, and very young-looking woman, who recently discovered sexuality both confusing and strengthening it - although in Cate Shortland's film course tackles this aspect best. But while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to reject this movie as a cliche, PEACH is, in some ways, much more ambitious than somersault. Perhaps that's where it's not well done. It's certainly very different from Monahan's first feature - the INTERVIEW! I'm not quite certain how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung add in the story. Who knows - maybe they did. They are certainly rammed home to the compromised and flawed nature of the weaving character - although I personally think this has been achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** just look at the picture ******** <br /> <br /> In a second look, I can see how some would postpone it as a telemovie dresses as a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these 'categories' are, or even if we should distinguish. In any case, I think that there are enough layers of the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the film structure is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging, at least on the SOMERSAULT path, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE FAMILY FAMILY DOCTOR, see both the HUMAN TOUCH and TOUCH. Their performance really, but I got to the realization that the main reason I enjoyed the movie was because it fit the genre "Australian", without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be a Justice is good reason for someone else * PA * love it! Indeed, it was not until Lung entered the room in his Vietnamese clothing that the movie really started packing a punch. But leading us to another debate - should * we hope that a movie should challenge us all the time? Certainly I enjoy being challenged by a movie (or a book, or else), but there is no room anymore for what is simply a nice story? <br /> I have not erased my first post on this movie, because I'm all too aware of the Orwellian rounds of such an act. But I would divert my initial evaluation out of a 8 maybe a 6.5. As for nominations for AFI Best Film, my vote goes to the TOUCH PEOPLE, THREE DOLLARS and look at both routes - and I think look ANY should be.
