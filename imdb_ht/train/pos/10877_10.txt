I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the movie thinking how cool it was, others were just laughing and commenting on how stupid it was. Well that was because it does not have been taken so badly, basically it's a movie that mocks horror cops and does a good job job .. There seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm ... Scary movie? ? Well this is Aussie, and original !!! Jessica Napier performs an overpowering performance and Sarah Kants has a definite future of acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was an even better move. The Princess Impossible Queen Of The Screen !! I recommend seeing this flicker, as you'll guess until the end of many connections with Raffy, Hilary and the movie that has never ended 20 years ago.
