In the classic sense of humor cards (which are not specific to the concept of comic or even entertainment), Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." treat all of the humor, and actually in very funny, fun way. There is the Phlegm, as personalized by Lauren Bacall very slowly, guarded, and characteristic of Esther Brill, who in life's mission appears all about appearance, protects the secrets of his age and beauty beyond his possessions. Has Cholera Paul Dooley Dr. Gil Gainey, who loves a fish out of water (maybe more like a jump) flops around frenetically, barking and encouraging the crowd to subscribe to his aquatic madness. Melbourne Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell smacks of Hamlet troubled with the self-righteous Shakespeare - even posting a soliloquy or two. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's character, Bobby Hammer ("Breast that feeds the baby to the rule of the world"). Then there are characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively sane characters try to make some kind of balance among all the extreme companions and humor converts to H.E.A.L.T.H. - A type of global trading organization specializing in H.E.A.L.L.H.H, which is said to be healthier. This is Altman's best classic.
