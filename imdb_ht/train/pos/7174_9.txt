I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere - and really happy I did. As a great movie fan and a long life in Northern California, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films were made in the Bay area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments on persistence, community and having a vision really resonate with me. <br /> Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can do it in SF, so can be other artists. <br /> I would recommend this movie
