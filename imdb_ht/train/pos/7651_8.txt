An exciting television movie based on true facts, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his youngest brother, who has the delicate mission to decide whether he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. But when he goes to visit him, he goes to Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with the ability to act. It just looks like the version of a proletarious prisoner according to "G.Q." magazine, and a language too sophisticated for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This achievement came to me after meeting an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in Panamanian prison. My young boy knew that she was gone, not only because she was older, but due to her exposure for an extended time in the penal system. There is prison and there is a prison, one must say, but one prisoner of "shot of the heart" is definitely out of this world.
