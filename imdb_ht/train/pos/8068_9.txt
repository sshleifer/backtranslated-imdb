To watch this movie from start to finish without bursting in laughter at some point requires almost a acts of faith, as one has to say to himself, "it's old", "it's a classic", " be kind ", not because movie is so bad, but because of its best it's so good. This is one movie dated. It's also a classic, if one finishes. I'm not inclined to laugh at anyone anyway, on principle, and I get more than slightly irritated when others do that. To make fun of the Informator in my mind is a little like giggling in an idiot savie when it dribbles her orange juice over all the laps. Yes, one says himself, he's a fool, and yet when he's on top of his game he's also a true surprise. The same is true for the informer, which is very insuportable occasion indeed, and yet he has many splendid photography, some good acting, a wonderful note and a good, decent simple story. In the end, which I will not give away, politics, religion and psychology come together, in a church, in a way of making the scene look like coral and on the head, and yet so is life sometimes. Uncultured people in simple behaviors behave differently from us (presumably glossy) as modern, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. But the people behave, and say so. Not everyone is hip, and may not even be desirable for everyone to hip. Are people today very much superior to those in seventy or eighty years ago? And in what way? I do not think so. We are just different. Now go watch the movie.
