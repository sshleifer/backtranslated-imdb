Hole (2003, or Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is unjustly convicted of stealing, he is sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. In this camp, the Warden, with his levy, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski ordered their comrades to dig holes after holes after holes. But why? Stanley plans to find out. I never really had any intention of looking at 'holes', and I must admit, I only really watch the movie, because I'm like a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of it, then , it does not matter. 'Holes' is one of these Disney films that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautiful writing and incorporating a wonderful idea from including flashbacks in the past. These do not distract and really give a great story back. All the cast is great. The young stars act well with the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Chia LaBeouf shows that even at 17, she can act without any defects. This is one Disney movie, you definitely would enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learned of failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
