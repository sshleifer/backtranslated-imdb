I would not go so far that this movie is not recommended, since the only issues I have with it are due to an excitement on the trace devices used in the movie - the sort of common things in every movie movie ever made it looks like. That's not it bad, just not something I'd go far. <br /> It's a little sacral, so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more understanding to be disappointed in a kid-kid-like movie like this. However, everyone who goes out of the window when squirrels (one of all the trailers) come on screen. Time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers were wise to say these guys' hey, could you stick to a little more squirrel? every time it gets intolerably dull. This does not save the movie, but you can say 'at least there was one aspect where I could not stop laughing. 'And of course, visually it will not disappoint, but that's almost a given and pixar flicks. In everything, I would put this at the bottom ... but that's not in itself bad.
