I get teased all the time by family and friends for tears in my eyes, and they were not ashamed when I looked at this one. I have been calling many times but believe me it was not about early. I was hurting the family and I was sick for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how. Denzel was awesome as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize though; years were not good for her. My husband does not re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate movies (dreams !!!!) He watched this movie 5 times now and I'll have to get the DVD to watch it again because it tore out tape and she's flying all the time I watched.
