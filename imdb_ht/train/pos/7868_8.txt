But again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a ride in the wild side. With a remarkable one it is, literally and simulating. <br /> Mumbai hi-societies - stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, though very many - are in good focus here. In typical fashion magazines, the worlds unfold, with a colorful story a smart sub-sketch of itself. A broadcast starlet thrown by the producer after her pregnancy, the stewardess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile businessman and his nursing wife, the reporters and the police commander; all shades of exposure and countless tones in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar performs a swollen task in digging the dirt over the drama kings, Queens are dancing and dying alive. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, such as making Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Concord Sen Sharma is effective as former reporter crimes defeated, but he could have pop up a little bit of keeping up with changes in work and racing the party. <br /> <br /> Very focused (running time 140 mins) with different freeze frames, well worth the money.
