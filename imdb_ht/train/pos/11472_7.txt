As a fan of looking beyond the phenomenon that is shooting school, this movie has taken an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of video recording performed by the two troubled guys (I can not refer to those killed as boys or adolescents), the months of preparation leading to zero days (the codename for the day on which they will attack) the movie will try to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun. It seems like intentions to show the pain they suffer, yet focus on the literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered. The only point in which emotions became overwhelming ended, as expected. But leading up to this point, it's never really clear as to why this plan is out. We told the story is required to pass, but the movie also seems to contradict this. Without damaging the movie, it's easy to say that it was a great attempt and had the same great intent, but fell short because of sloppy movie-making. All directing is amateur, to the more independent video concept, but the story with weaknesses continually. The movie looks like the audience decides a lot, but also fails to provide the information for such an event. The finish is abrupt, and it does not feel like it ends all the movie started.
