Woah! Only one thing I can say about this movie. Personally I'm one of those who loves cats so they would be a big down side of the movie, but I loved reading how cats came from all they got revenge to the end. <br /> I love the movie, but I must admit it was because I found Brian Krause playing Charles Brady very pretty irresistible, I guess lover got the best of me while watching this movie. <br /> There was one thing that I was disappointed. I watched Charmed before and Brian Krause married Holly Marie Combs, her kiss scene was O.K. In Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to her kiss scene with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if she is because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe it's a bit more, that was the only disappointment of the movie but I Guess she's made up with and Brian Krause of these tightly jeans ass she brought to the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs in the sky husband and father of her child or for a great surprise with this movie, she's nothing like boys . Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see Krause's character on charms taken over by what's wrong to make him something like he was in Sleepwalkers. <br /> I also said the music was GREAT in this movie too!
