Do all you please put the hell on Todd Dra !!! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with! The guy had 735 zombies with a regular throw to work for FREE! Ensuring the act is mockingly at times. Yes the make-up is no older you'll ever see. But it's not the worst night, if you want to see that, go look zombie zombies with her raccoon zombie. This is the best-quality, old-fashioned film-making garde! Todd is a professional consumer, with an all around nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems far from looking. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I wish Todd sheets would come out of hiding and pointing to that he was going to. If someone has ever tried to make a movie, they know that just finished it, is a success in and in itself.
