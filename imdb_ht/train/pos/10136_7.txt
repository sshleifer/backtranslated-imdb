This is one of the best episodes in the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... It's kill'em all, often the victims (Screwfly Solution, Pro-Life, Valerie on Mach Stairs, I do not remember Argento's episode in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint). I think he likes to look at women being burned, tortured, tired and I do not know. Never smaller "right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphical scenes and suspense (especially with photos from the cellar, wonderful). The act is like the whole series, regular I might be as bad as "Pro-life" or "We cry for ice cream". Also I think the plot it could be for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is terrible, kill and destruction of women, mutilating animals and over and over ... the first quarter was better than the second one and episodes like "Burn Cigarrette" (the best of all) "Resident" (The Most Funny), "Imprint" (really shocking).
