I enjoyed watching this movie very much. It has a great direction, not already known to the Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the film takes place, in Catalu√±a, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna explores once more the theme in a box, in this case sessions of a young boy for the milk women. There are some psychological concepts in this story as the complex rejection that older son feels with the birth of his brother. In the movie this is what leads to the surrender of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk goes to the newborn baby. So she starts trying to find a breast that can feed her. She finds it in a woman recently arrived and out here on the movie is all around. This film lives much on imagery, more than the story itself, the Spectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) with certain symbols (the movie deserves a thowough analysis on almost everything that happens because it usually means something. ..). The environments, typical scenery from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the soundtrack soundtrack by Nicola Piovani are transported us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times ... Worth living in this world, worth watching this movie, even though we can eventually and for moments get tired of a bit sick with the excessive penalty, which is perhaps taken beyond limits ... <br /> <I also enjoy the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
