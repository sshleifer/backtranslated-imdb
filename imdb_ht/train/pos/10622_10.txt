"Hatred in a minute" is a hauntingly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a trip to the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performance and excellent cinematography make this movie a "must see" for any movie student or horror fanatic. The reality of the story with the human side of Eric separated this movie from other psycho-crime pianos. Some screams in the movie producer, Bruce Campbell as well as the film "The Evil Dead" add some humor to anyone who knows the genre.
