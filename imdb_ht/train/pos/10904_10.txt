Most moving and real-time documents ever created. I called all the way from the beginning to the end. Watching the show you immediately captured by fighting a man in without pain, to live a life we ​​would take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to understand living in agony every year of my life. I really felt it. The sadest part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses out his coffin. Can you imagine doing that? Even more so, even though she was in painful and unbearable pain she still opened up her own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people who deserves respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, what a true hero and denies it was!
