I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to staying true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the play come to life on the screen and makes it easier for those who keep the text while watching, as we did while studying it, tracking and analyzing the text. <br /> One of the things I have heard is criticizing many times being dropped off by the great Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps the viewers to recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same as the help of the confusion virtually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Also, the flashlights help clear the ambiguity of the text. Like how the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really goes and why Fortinbras just reaches the castle to the end. All in all, not only this version includes some brilliant performances by actors who are both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that one should not make an English Ph.D PhD to understand and enjoy it.
