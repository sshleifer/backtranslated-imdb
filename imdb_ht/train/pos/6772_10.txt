Unlike another user who said this movie seeps (and Olivia Hussey was awful), I agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is scared of everything it's in! Yeah it may be older now, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but it's wonderful! <br /> You can use this line quite often, but it is a unique movie and I'll fight back on anyone who agrees! I enjoyed this movie as I have any other movie Olivia Hussey. Olivia's "My Girl" and I love her work. <br /> I see this for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with her. Not only because it's a Olivia movie, but because it's unique story line and wonderful direction.
