I loved Antz, but I loved "life of a bug". The animation has been put into this pay off. I'll definitely get this on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a panoramic version of this movie on tapes. (I've heard of squishing all of the characters on the screen on the standard video format). Most will have to agree that the credit ends are the funniest! I saw only one of the two sets, but I can not see anything else!
