There may be a special reason why the Fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. Having just said goodbye to my new fiancÃ© - in oh ... one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and she suffered the fallout from putting on the brave face he needed to see. /> <br /> I watched a few movies and TV shows, but my interest darted out of what I left behind in what came out and what I did not see. For this, I have this thanksgiving movie. Being a nature lover and hearing about the movie in advance, I was sure I was going to love it anyway. But I did not just like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> mastery of technique is surprising. How to do it? How did they take the animals in their way? It's just nice. <br /> <br /> The morality of the story is a good one and while the finish is oh so french and ambiguous, it's a sad / sad one. Again, it keeps me a bit off-guard. As someone who usually holds her emotions in mind, the finish was hard to go while on a full plane I could see for the next 15 hours! Maybe it's because the finish made me think back to what I left. <br /> But for that a few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And it is life. Sure, there are things you like and feel comfortable around ... but the great outdoors keep up a mystery. So, next time I see something out of the ordinary while out of the open; I will explore it, observe it and embrace it. That's precisely what's going on in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this good movie / nature doc too. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months on from the plane trip. We still do not know when we will see each other again, but we will.
