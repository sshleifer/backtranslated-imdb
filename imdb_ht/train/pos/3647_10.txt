I love it when they actually do a good sports story. So many of the past were so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really nice movie, a kind of old-fashioned story - and based on a real life guy doing exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. She plays a high school coach talking to trying out, late athlete-speaking lives, becoming a jug of professional baseball. Eventually, it reached its goal of making it to the Big LIG, though it was a very short stint. <br /> <br /> All the characters in here are lovely people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players of his high school team, his boy (Angus T. Jones, now a bit of a star on television.) Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports movie, he knows how to throw a baseball. It looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real life jug in one documentary on the DVD. So, if you are looking for a beautiful, inspirational sports movie life, you can not be wrong with this one.
