Once I was in college and we had a wonderful international, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "No boltay!", Meaning "no gossip!" I "translate" it for the "generation" of TV Watchers as "not Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the ocean neighbor on "wet"). However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short "Rumor", you see that it's not quite a laugh problem. In this case, the soldier without mercy embarked on a shelling and subsequently assumed that the Axis powers had attacked the United States. So he told it to someone, who told someone else, who told someone else, and he continued. As in the "Russians are coming, the Russians are coming," the story blows more and more out of proportion every time, so that when it comes to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's the WWII propaganda - complete with a humiliating term for the Japanese - but I said that the Pvt. Snafu Snafu was actually quite funny. Of course, since Dr. Seuss wrote and Mel Blanc gave their voice, it does not surprise that these were out rather cool. Worth to see.
