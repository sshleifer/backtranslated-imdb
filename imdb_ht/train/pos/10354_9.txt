A CRY IN THE DARK <br /> A CRY IN THE DARK was a movie that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep with a solid, unremarkable movie. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's best comedian nomination, the film received little attention from major award groups. <br /> <br /> Little has anticipated that a CRY in the DARK would be like a fixed, well-constructed drama on every level. If you ask me, this is a classic under-appreciated. The film opens rather slowly, leaving the hearing resolved in the Chamberlain at a relaxing pace and really noticed that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (director) selects random moments to take a family vacation that provides a sense of approaching tragedy, while showing the attentive and Lindy (Streep) and Michael Neill Chamberlain care for their children. <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo takes my baby!" has become a bit of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to ridiculous. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience to fear and ask questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in court room and focuses on continuing battle The Chamberlain proves innocent in the press and the court, suspect Lindy's murder. <br /> The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that the innocent make the tension trials all the more attractive. As a member of the hearing, I was completely invested in Chamberlain's scheme ... and they were really upset and hurt and saddened when they looked so horrible by the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I liked the way the media did not mean they were to be sympathetic, but they always had reasonable grounds to maintain their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the movie is very profound and captivating perfectly the central element that makes this movie much different from other court series. <br /> In performance terms, the only ones that really have trouble in this movie are those of Streep and Neill ... and are delivered in every way. For me, this rank as one (if not # 1) better Meryl Streep performance. For all his mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of his character. I found this to be one of the more subtle Streep's performance, and he struck it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing to JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I saw, this is undoubtedly the finest work Neill to date. It's a shame he was not recognized by the Academy and a leading matching matching match with the Streep ... b / c two of them to play in every other brilliant. <br /> <br /> More emotionally captivating than most films, and also incredibly thrilling ... A crisis in the DARK is far beyond my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know in the movie as flick in the place where Meryl screams "The Dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and see just how much more there's a CRY in the dunk then one line. ...
