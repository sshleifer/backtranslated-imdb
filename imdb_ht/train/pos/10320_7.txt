*** Probably possible .. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was happy to see that he laughed at the right places and was thrilled by sequences their actions. Ron Ely is just right as doc. Cool, calm, almost always in control (and with an occasional twinkle in his eyes). What more can one ask for? I never read a book Savage Doc, so I do not know if it is faithful to the source, but I've enjoyed the light and derring-tone tone. Many have compared this to the adventurous movie in the Lost Box, which I do not think is fair. The budget difference is surprising (adventurers must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the job where many adventurers have. Special effects are also a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and humor is just right. Music music is catchy (love this song song- Every time I watch the movie, I finish the colorful theme for days) .The best way to approach this movie is to just relax and enjoy. Highlights include sequences of exciting opening where the fabulous five and Doc chase the American sniper across the three in New York and the very funny sequence between Doc and Captain Sea. Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). Overall a great movie to look on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Savage Doc ... thanks the Lord here!
