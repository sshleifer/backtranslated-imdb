If you are under 13 or above 13 and beautifully intoxicated, you will enjoy D-Wars. If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action movies, you will enjoy D-Wars. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie today with my nephew and 3 of friends. They really love it and that makes me feel good. After the movie ended, all the kids (my nephews and friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. Acting and directing is terrible. Storyline is very simple. But since half of the hearing, the children were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This experience has looked far more interesting than it should be. <br /> It's a good movie to take your kids, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it very much.
