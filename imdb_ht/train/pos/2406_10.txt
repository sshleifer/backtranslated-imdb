This is the best show of what I think Jesus really was like. Most movies show Jesus as being sly, lobotomized, or tortured. This laughed Jesus, and was serious when it was necessary. This is the kind of person Jesus could attract, not the hollywood version usually. <br /> <br /> The movie took some freedom, try to "fill in the empty spaces." but the files did not seem impossible, or even probable. One thing I could argue was that he never really explained what their romance was against Jesus (films describing the romance being the main driver of death gestures, not what the Jewish authorities were against the idea). /> It seemed that the film was doing well. An example was commentary commentary on a boy called "mark". They believe that mark (or brand name) the boy was referred to in the field of gethsemane whose dress was pulled off and ran naked (Mark 14:51). I found the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate (even in spirit) as much as possible.
