"Sunshine Secrets" reminds me of the "rapture" (1991), and Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but Korean production is a better movie. It shows super-religious Korean Christians in a Korean city, and experiences the main character in communicating with them in awakening of a terrible tragedy. Shin-ae is a mother of one who moved to the city of Milyang ('Chinese Sunshine' in Chinese) in Seoul and her son. He chose Milyang because her late husband (died in an auto accident) was born, and she felt she needed to make a new start to life in a new place. It does not respond well to the opening of local Christian wing, one of its members trying to convince her to come to church and prayer meetings. Shin-e is essentially ireligi and brushing these people off as polite as it can. In fact, she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with, but some are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more should give the movie away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (jeon do-yeon) is meaningless. Having read that he won the Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I hope it's a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is fascinating and it is impossible to take your eyes on it when it is on screen. The movie is a sort of attacker Evelyn Waugh-sketches pieces of work, showing how fate can feel as crazy as much as weird inevitable.
