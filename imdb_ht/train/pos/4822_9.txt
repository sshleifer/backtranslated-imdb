Having someone keep your hands every time walking up or down stairs? Do others eat your snack before you eat it? Facing a Mum of More Than? These are just a few of the obstacles that the Victoria Victoria faced with in this film (there's also various power struggles on, as well as attempts on her life). Needless to say, it does look much fascinating and informative. <br /> I've only seen Emily Blunt in the Devil wearing Prada (and little else). As it was in that movie, it is once again the exceptional here. I was very impressed with her painting of the young Victoria, and she thought she was busy with the role. He transitions from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the movie Victoria's Queen gets later entirely credible. Blunt is perfectly thrown into the role, which shows everywhere different (from the vulnerable, to the fortress, from the young Victoria who mistakes the queen who takes control). Not enough to say about Emily Blunt in this role. It's - simply - exquisite, commander of your every second it's on screen. It keeps you transhipped up and including the final shot of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The actors have good chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developed relationships. They have disagreements, but you can say they are in love. Blunt and Friends are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what's going on between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the movie are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not one bad performance in this movie. Those focusing well-focused on-the-spot well also show that they have time to screens. Even the dog Victoria (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel called Dash) is memorable and makes an impact in the movie. Although the film tends to jump over a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead * tells * us what happened (with him and Albert) on the screen, what's the most important is that we actually * see *. This is, after all, a movie about the 'Young Victoria' (by Victoria's Middle-Aged, or 'Victoria's Old'). While some beauties made about this story and film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is telling us the story of how the young princess got up to power. The movie looks amazing, Emily Blunt's costumes are visually stunning and the music only adds to the movie, never detracts out of it. It's exceptionally injected and, unlike a lot of films these days, this movie is actually a good length, as it does not run on all the time that you lose interest or feel it's in need of being drawn out. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that what makes this movie great is Emily Blunt. It's fine here, turning into another excellent performance and elevating this movie above what it might be, another actress has been cast in this rather important / historic role. This is one finely fabricated film, with excellent performance that should definitely be seen. If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who has been very important in history, this is a must-see.
