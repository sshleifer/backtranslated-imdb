For anyone who has seen only Disney's highly acclaimed version of the 'Beauty & the Beast' version, or even Jean Cocteau's real fairy tale story will be taken aback by 1975 French (but with a director from Poland) version. The plot concerns a French family of fake aristocrat who is married to a well-performing English family. The worst thing is that the bride will bring an old curse on the family. The film also includes many flashlights (potentially) explaining this curse family. From the opening credits, at the very end, it's an almost non-stop erotic fun ride ride, with some very greedy & graphic content (hence the X rating of the United States in its first run, which is now unrated). A ridiculous movie in the classroom's decision will probably remind one of Bunul's volcanoes in similar territories. If you have a taste for really scarce, and are not offended by "taboo" materials, then this film can just scratch that it is rash for you.
