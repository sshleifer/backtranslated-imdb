Home Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a really great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways. She has written a bunch of good and well-written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and the movie is about to think you in fact is causing your problems and the reason for your anger hardly ever is to cause you to think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but hardly ever do that. To watch this movie and learn something very important about life, you must keep yourself very open and listening to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines found in life) that most of the parts of this movie have you listen and look. Look at it with your ears. <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and get the most out of it ... <br /> So while looking, please keep in mind you: <br /> <br /> "The idea is like a parachute, it does not work unless it's open!"
