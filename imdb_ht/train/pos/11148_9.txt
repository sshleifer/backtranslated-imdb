'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X and released the original back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. Movies about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) from Texas in New York City become a hustler is sometimes a bit disturbing. Dress up as a cowboy she tries to live like a hustler, making money by the act of love. It does not work out as it planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money to become friends. They live in a vacant and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso got sick and Joe tried to make some money. The movie was probably rated X for the main topic, but on the way we see some amazing things. Editing in this movie is great. We see the sequence of dreams from Joe and Ratso cut by the real world in a beautiful and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the actors are supported by great performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine line of fame. The note is made by John Barry and great sound. All this makes this a great movie that won the Oscar best for a good reason.
