I have not seen this film of years so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this film is twice film in Braveheart. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look, dirty hair with beard and simple clothes. Also, Liam Nesson has a Celtic look on her, she looks like a Scot Scot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that fewens people, but comparing it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposedly playing a legendary man who caused him to be described as a 6-foot giant 7 while Gibson is almost a shorter foot. The story has a little romance, plot and a storyteller story. Sounds as Braveheart? But instead of a movie that cries out "freedom", freedom and nationalism we find a movie that tells honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting movie. Much like gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this effort. The story is great and how it deals with courage and humanity. The scene where Mary is rape and is walking out of the house burning with a look at true Scottish forces followed by washing the circle from her side to an extreme panic. This is something a heroine of Braveheart would never do. Overall this is a stunning look and almost imperfect. Go and see it!
