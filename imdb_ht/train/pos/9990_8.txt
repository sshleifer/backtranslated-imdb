I've seen the movie recently and really liked it. I was surprised and cried. This movie is in the genre of nil nest as "Kill Out It" - or even the "List Bucket", but to handle the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really hard to have the main character as unfair as Agar. The principal performs a mastery and challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and is not a hotly attractive woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets this through without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) was taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She faces her out-of-way and freaks out. Its side is really hard. It means. It is belittling and selfish. It's a stone. I did not like it - not even a little. <br /> Throughout the course of the film, we get insight. We find out why he does not like petunias, why he favors one son on the other, how his losses shaped his character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to love her. I especially love her when she pour out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a Scene! <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the liking viewer. I understand more clearly that hard edges of a person's life are protected, they are for a reason ... Aga is not my mother - it's not even mother-in-law or neighbors ... but some parts of it They are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those people somehow make my sense of sense now that I watched the Stone Angel.
