Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Be sure to give us movies like Batman Start. Oh, in the path to Hollywood I think they can cover the story line in the Batman movie, but please do not entertain us what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because he let me want more. I was looking around to see when he came out. It was such an awful horrible practice. The graphics where the good story line seemed solid and had all the trapings in a big movie. Unfortunately it will not happen for now. For the producers, the directors and all the big actors work but I hate you to do this with me. You let me want more.
