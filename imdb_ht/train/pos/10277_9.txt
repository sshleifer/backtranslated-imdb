This is almost a perfect movie. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never said so successively. This is really about the failure of confidence, in the human condition. The film draws the idea that we are all criminals, no one innocent. Is anyone living today who has not seen this play out of our own society, every single day? The movie is highly structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there is no more innocent character. The world is now completely polluted, ruined by all involved in the con. Could anything be more true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the band. It is wonderful.
