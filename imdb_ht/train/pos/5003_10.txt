I was not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. The critics of this just do not get it! It's one of the funniest and most entertaining stuff about T.V at this time! Though, when interviews were made and popular folks probably seemed unkempt; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and it's a laughing riot. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. The pig and the baby breast and her mother is priceless. The husband and wife bird talking about health problems, and the male bird took a crap after the wife said she was completely confused to break me up! Beauty comfort is the most imaginative show I've ever seen in a moment! Hopefully, it will come back next summer then run over.
