Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the longest manager of Craps New York craps game, and he needs $ 1000 to get a new place. Trusting in his chances, he bets higher city rollerblock, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not woo missionary missionary Sara Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Gurus and Dolls (1955)' are such a great music because it cleverly mixes the contrasting styles of films and stages. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move at rhythms, stop and start as if responding to the slider signal. Even the movable movements themselves are stylized with angular, half way between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering flirt of deco color art and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground games and criminal thuggery seems perfectly jealous. I just received words that Jean Simmons passed away, age 80. That unbelievably, it was the first time I saw him in a movie, yet he had blown me from the start. Sarah, idealist and sexual-reprimanded her from her shell after an alcohol drink in Havana, left with an adorable playful representation of "If I Was A Bell." Although both Simmons and Brando were non-musicians, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub the songs, which proved that "maybe you do not sound good, but at least it's yours." Although Goldwyn's confident turning, the pair both do well to bring all the music numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same for children like Audrey Hepburn might bring in the role, and Brando relies on self self-esteem and charisma that he does not have trouble singing his songs by the well.
