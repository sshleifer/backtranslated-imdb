Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not only in the civil liberties of Americans but in the hearts and spirits of everywhere, Danny Helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief in a Danish middle school 1969. More specifically, she works her way to the crusade of a young boy called Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapting to a true story, performances are executed with certain aplombs and a refreshing order of varying characters to keep it involved. A battle of ideology between a 13 year old and a refusal disciplinary gives way to humor inherent but awkward schedules of atmosphere disorder despite keeping his reckless cynic of the same vein as a "Dead Poets Society" more than a "Matilda" . It draws a familiar path but a continuous and precise service of its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rings frits as a young boy becomes a young man, manages to raise the movie in a rousing family movie with his nose finger on money .
