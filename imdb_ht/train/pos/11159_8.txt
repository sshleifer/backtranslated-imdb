This is a wonderful movie ... The first impression of cynicism and brilliance are soon dissipated by a fun love show of how boys and women of diverge babe diverge (diverse differences!) <br /> You can love people despite and sometimes because of the weaknesses. Human beings are a little garbage really, but we have great heart and we try our best, despite temptation. It's not our fault when sometimes tense can not resist, that's just what we are. <br /> There is a consistent stylish of start to finish; dirty photography and sharp composition, very nice look when adding provocative content, well adapted to music and loud scripting laughs. <br /> <br /> Look out for the very young "voice of wisdom" ... brilliant; wisdom from innocent swing comedy to the human condition.
