Ghost History (The TV movie - 1972) was the pilot for the NBC series. The film was well written and well-acting, and, I thought, when the 1972-73 season TV began, if the TV series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video !!) The series was a Colosseo deception - even with William Castle as Executive. producer. If, however, you have a chance to watch the original TV movie, the Holy Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
