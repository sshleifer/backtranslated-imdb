John Travolta, the world's largest honkeytonk, and a mechanical bull ... what more you can ask for! Yeah, you're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one. But I've always found it nicely enjoyable to watch this romantic redneck. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet in the Gilley and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have. The honkeytonk scenes are fun and dancing, cycling mechanics, and-in-the-brawls required. He has a good 1980 band country, featuring "Looking for love at all places wrong", "The Devil goes down to Georgia", and "Alo Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Break out your cowboy boots and you have a boot-scootin 'boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (from 4)
