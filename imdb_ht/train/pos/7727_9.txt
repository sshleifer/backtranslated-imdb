PLANET FORBIDDEN is the best SF film from the Golden Age SF movie and making it a great movie is its essence of wonder. As soon as the spacecraft audience - through the pirate human team - travels through a clever and sometimes frightening adventure. We meet Robbie unforgetable, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, Altair beautiful and its innocent and we learn about the ancient inhabitants of the planet - Krell who died out overnight. Or did you do it? <br /> You can nitpick and say that the planet is obviously filmed in a film studio and painter who painted but adds into a sense of threat to klaustraphobia I feel with Babys and Louis Electronics music music adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocking this film is not in the top of 250 IMDB films.
