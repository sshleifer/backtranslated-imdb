My fascinating approach to me is Curious (yellow) and her companion's piece and great twilight. I would read a lot about its widely alleged controversy and explicit sex. What I received was not this, but a well thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other. I sincerely believe that the majority of those who commented on the movie 'humanity' or `boring 'came to the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming pornography is something that intends to titulate their senses, but it is intentionally un-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, launches it all in his performances a realistic and humanity that is simply compelling and persevering. Her breasts can saggy, her nipples great, her thighs fat, and her face, chubby. But at the end of the film, the audience has come to identify with him, and accept his default as human. This touch gives even more credibility out of necessity. The director of a bomb Bardot Bardot would have been canceled. I can not really recommend this piece of provocative piece. Prepare to invest a lot of thinking in the movie rhythm. Patients and passionate people are well rewarded in the way most other films can dream.
