I just watched this movie and I must say that I was so impressed. All of it was superb. Acting in the characters, the story. A credible child who grew up in brave, always wants to help others. Mum must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this film so fear of missing something. He is the factory director / story with moral, beautiful and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless happy. A child poked and intimidated to school that became a hero. Were chosen to be a rider at the local village festival and a trip to the Goblin Mountain where he discovered the Yokai, who is amazing creation that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil and ridiculous cut kato it definitely needs a hug. These evil people capture Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical stuff and those melded into one robotic robbery horrible monsters whose only job is to kill. Takashi a young boy is one of them to become their savior, with a red man / dragon a turtle and a Princess River as well as a cute little animal that, if the Americans could turn it into a cuddly game and sell it to every good game store. Lines are good especially not to try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your mouth. Stop believing and watch it with a child or on your own and enjoy! Even though I must admit that the end was a bit sad. And it's not necessarily so. Cheers Furdion
