I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times right now, the first time I watched the second half after the time and then returned to the first hour. an entertaining, entertaining movie, thank God Knight knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the hard life of Queen Victoria and her hard choices. There is nothing wrong with the movie at all, there is no bad language or something in a sexual nature that would be offensive to watch family. Could push the kids to research a little over Victoria's queen herself and maybe lesser character known as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
