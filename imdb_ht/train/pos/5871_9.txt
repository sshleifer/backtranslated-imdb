I take care of each and every frame of this beautiful movie. It is about regular people, whom we all know, who suffer a little from their lives and some luggage carry around. Just like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life into their portraits and are all excellent, but Harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real. You would swear it really is a trucker who drinks so it will not have to feel anything. Baker as her sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, she looks like she never gave flowers before and probably did not. Very refreshing.
