OK, so the Oscars seem to get hyped just a little more every year. And I was rooting for "Gosford Park" to win (coming up, Robert Altman had deserved an Oscar for years!). That said, I guess it was high time for an African-American to win better comedy. Unlike the previous review, Halle Berry's role in the "Monster Ball" was far more original than Nicole Kidman's "Moulin Rouge"; I would never think of the letter for anything, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr." .. Among the things that I had anticipated was the thing about the September 11 attacks; I knew that they were going to say something about freedom. Yeah, yes. Robert Redford should know best. But, contrary to the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst army (among all the last ones Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really liked it in John Ashcroft. So, although I would not give "a nice idea" to the best photos, "The 74th Academy Awards Awards" are always happy with me (I admit, I love the Oscars more than my birthday). And next day, as my parents and I were hiking in the homes of Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring break - I thought myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people looked at them "Jim who?" I wonder whether Woody Allen will ever go to the Oscars again.
