There is great detail in a Bug's life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The movie is not too strong orignal, it's basically a modern take on the Seven Samurai Kurosawa, only with bugs. I enjoyed the character interaction however with the bad guys in this movie actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes bad guys copies of copies of the cut-outs. Kindergarten are ominous and hopper, the bad guy's lead, was a bright creation. Check out this one out.
