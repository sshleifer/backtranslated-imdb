After a 7-year road on stone rock on NBC, it was decided to make one last Super installation. The series was on bubbles several times thanks to no numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster in a TV hour. He always had a sizable, tough basic of hard body of followers. <br /> It was almost as if the series and the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a sort of "Mr. In-Ant" in series. It was too big just to cancel, but too little to get a case of Rabid 'Ravings' assessment. <br /> <br /> During the delicate time of evening on Friday, some of the best and most expansive artists of Dtan drama were featured. There, I told it Artistic, Artistic !! But please remember that we mean artistic but not just Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically Corrected Preaching. <br /> <br /> When at last, it was something sure that it was the end of the line for "homicide"; This super episode was prepared as this 2 hours made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Look at everything past and parade of regular characters, the output team out and gives us what proves to be a super throwing. <br /> <br /> Our story? ?????. As we get into the story, we find that Baltimore Homicide Commander officer, Lt Al Giardello "pulls the pin", retired to the job, that is. But 'G' is not ready to really retire-retired again. So, instead of a rock tackle fishing oa, we find that going to Mayor at 'City Charm.' While out of the City, some suspended campaigns and speeches, the Lieutenant's detective captured a killer. Live, but in a state of comet, he is taken to the Hospital. <br /> <br /> News spreads quickly and as if officially called, we find all the detectives in Baltimore Units we've seen on the show showing up to offering services and assistance. There is a great meeting of those ancient gumshoes and present as they go up and follow each lead and the possibility of a lead. The producer has found a way to deal with people who have already died in bringing the memories to the story. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and even introduce some here to unrevealed them. The whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we will leave that as "classified". In enveloping everything in a bunch of clean, little, this movie film surely gets our endorsement. As for the "HOMICIDE PHOTO" ranking, we must provide it with A or A +, even. But no matter the class here, he did not score as high as a typical weekly episode.
