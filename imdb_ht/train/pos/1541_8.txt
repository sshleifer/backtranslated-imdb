Just see this film today at Festival Festival Festival Seattle, and she enjoyed it well. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and credible interaction among the cast, with great comic distribution as well. <br /> <This movie touches on the terms of the universal family and separation. As a result, I can see European, Asian, and American audiences all points found in the similarity between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, this has the potential to be the best underground dating movie of the year ... someone distributed in this USA, please! Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It really is a great movie.
