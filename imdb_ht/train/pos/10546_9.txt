I was chatting on this movie because I had a free release that was not new from Blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly, as the store got ready to close for the evening. Plains the white cover and my intrigue titles. I'm a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son is a young man of 30. I adore movies that are absolute entertainment, such as the Sixth Session, Interview with a Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and enjoying highly specialized alien films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate each other's films, however, we both watch and love the movie PA! It was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before. We are also the kind of cynical personality / criticism and we usually crack on movies while we look at them - but in this case we just laugh and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. It is our opinion that if this film was encouraged and shown in the mainstream theater in the US it would be very good indeed.
