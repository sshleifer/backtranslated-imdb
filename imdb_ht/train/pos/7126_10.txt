This movie resonates with me on two levels. As a kid I was evacuated from London and planted on hosts hosts in a country village. While I escaped the shelling and had the experience of producing precious memories (for example hearing an alleged sung tonight for the very first time) and enjoying a life I could never have had in London, I missed my family and worry you on them. Tom is an old man whose wife and children both have died and those who are alone in a small village town.As an old man who is now without a wife with children was married to living far in another province, I am even lonely. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic and odd idea of ​​raising a child. Since a deep affection has grown between old Tom Oakley and this young man, Tom goes in search of him, and finally delivers him from very odd and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story there is tense since due to some bureaucratic decision it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
