In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the French and the enemy are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portugueses. A French (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás, and despite of his judgments convinced that he is French, they believe it is Portuguese. The French became slaves and marithers lived with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). And he used powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a fight. In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decided to eat it. <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o meu Francês" is another big budget film of great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. Simply is very original and the story speaks of Tupi. The shotgun film is using natural light most of the time and it is very realistic. Actors and actresses make naked and Ana Maria Magalhães are beautiful, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by the Europeans, focusing on Portuguese and French at that time, trading with the Indians and swapping combs and mirrors by our natural resources. This film was presented at the National Festivals as the 1971 Brazilian Cinema Brasília Festival (Festival de Brazília do Cinema Brasileiro) and Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), best dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Régis Monteiro); Art criticism of the Association of São Paulo (Association of Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with the Best Revelations of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o meu Francês" ("How delicious my French was")
