I heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends who saw it, and they all said it was amazing, so I was very hoping- and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! It was funny, he kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill him, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, too. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys tried to kill us!" Corky: "Yeah, I was wondering too. Actually, it's like dragging me out!" Nancy: "I hate people trying to kill me .. So rude!" <br /> <Nancy Drew
