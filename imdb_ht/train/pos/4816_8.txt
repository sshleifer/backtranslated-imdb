Enjoy the movie very much. Certainly will let the audience want to know more, and there are really many more historically to get out! <br /> <br /> Does the production team fall into the temptation of over dramatization, particularly in the shooting event? Has a ton of accurate accurate material has attracted? Prince Albert's contribution to UK and the monarchy mandated a movie on his own but was granted that apparently did not belong to the intent here. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are especially good, but I am of thinking that this production (judging by the title titles in the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted seriously for a British Court Authentic Label Expert beyond the Duchess of York? Yes Does Princess Victoria really stuff a truffle / crack (?) In her mouth while talking to the Prime Minister of the company in her Majesty and her full mouth? <br /> <br /> 'Never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. But loved to drop off the principals, whose act was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? I always feel like a totally detached, informing outside observers, more so than with "Mrs Brown" or the same "queen". But to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques that have been distracted from time to time.
