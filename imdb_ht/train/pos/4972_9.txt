WHEN CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I'll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian cinematographer Benoît Marriage is set in the industrial leafy of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the son has broken the door openings portfolio. What the father actually wants him for his son to be a human, because he never did it further as the reporter of local news for an ironically called newspaper L'Espoir (Hope). Of course there is nothing to work out as planned. This film can be best compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRESSING, though it is more dramatic and the humor is darker. Just like in that movie however the tone is most melancholy than depressing and optimistic to finish, without joylessness. The humor is absurd, without the incredible plot, and marriages find stunning images in the weak surroundings that never seem artificial. The best thing about ATTENDENT CONVOYERS is to act by Poelvoorde. This actor shot fame and also brilliant-classical C'EST ARRIVED LOOKING FOR CHESS QUESTIONS in which he plays Ben's Hitman Charismatic. Since then, he has only played two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own ability to act with all the roles he had offered reproach of the Ben character. With her return to a leading role in LCA would be no longer anymore on his acting. It is simply brilliant as someone stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he did and to be torn not to rush about it. A must see.
