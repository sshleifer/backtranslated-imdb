While I suppose that this movie could get the rap as is Anti-Vietnam, while watching it I did not feel that this was the case as much as the movie was simply an honest look at the perspective of The young guys were trained for a war that the public did not support .... it showed their fear, despair, drive ... all of it, out of the open, naked. As a soldier myself many of the terms sound true to me in my experience in the military - especially camp boots. On the whole movie, although it has been shot down on a very small budget, looks great, beautifully combined, with excellent features and directing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
