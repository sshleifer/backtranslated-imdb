I found this a bit difficult to follow in the limits that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail in who was fighting that and why. One of the issues is one of cultural / language. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwan / Japanese problem in which we know little and because we simply read the English translation inevitably loose some of the intricacies. Another problem is that there seems to be just too many just half to explain twists and coincidences. But it seems easy that there is a whole movie of Miiki and this is certainly not. Many of the violence and bone crunching violence, a window on some less than traditional sexual screenings on more family aspects. Everyone at all a decent ride but maybe check out the storyline might actually be useful before watching this one.
