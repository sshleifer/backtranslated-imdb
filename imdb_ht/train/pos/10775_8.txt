Nice movie with a big band that spans the rocky landscape of 70 to 80 years. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describing life in a small village near Correggio (town of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describing the life of young people and issues related to the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, and a bit of Italian touch.
