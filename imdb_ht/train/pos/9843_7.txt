* Includes crowds * * may include crowd * <br /> At the age of Shrek (the movie) & Pixar (the studio), this is a much more traditional movie animation. He put together some characters that normally could not see together (not to mention, try to save a human baby and bring him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friends. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is (only made in 20th Century Fox). The trailer in the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the movie does not live in the wear set of trailers. The problem lies with the fact that the musicians in the movie did not make up themselves that are the target audience of the movie. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children. Parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. Attention children focus on something else. The excellent schedules and the voice are good but this is nothing more than a beautiful movie. Children will love this movie, adults will only love it.
