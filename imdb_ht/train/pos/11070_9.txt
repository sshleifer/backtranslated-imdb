I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Guy bring together off the cast (iz) movie cast and make them of these glorious characters, he gave us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line and left the imagination. <br /> <br /> Far too many people want cinemas with a conspiracy that can be understood and handed over to a plate ... again these are the movies that get poorly reviewed because they are far too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get It Now!
