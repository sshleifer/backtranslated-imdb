This movie was a really great flick of something that affects us all. I know I was personally running at that time. Thankfully Will Smith has flown over the society's problems in text messaging while driving. People do not. An hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this reason. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was happy to see others in the theater saw the message and dropped their phones and popcorn bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and I would encourage others to do the same. If you care for your family, make them look at this important public service utility on text messaging while driving or killing seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
