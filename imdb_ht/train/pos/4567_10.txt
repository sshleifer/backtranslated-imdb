My left foot is an exceptional film that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, which has cerebral palsy, a serious disability and was only used in her left foot, but it was challenging, she managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds <br /> I saw this movie a lot of times and every time I saw it, I get it equally brilliant every time.I wonder how to make this amazing movie by winning an Oscer for better photos, It is a shambles by the Academy Award. Jim Shirdan is one of the greatest directors in the world scenario, the music and everything else is excellent in this movie. As the movie goes on, you would almost feel at home in brown as everything happens. MacAnally and Brenda Fricker's rays are amazing as parents Cristias and Fiona Shaw are equally brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, helping Christy over his fight in challenges . br> <br /> The Irish movie industry has been nothing in its name before my left foot. The footstep started in a wonderful period of Irish movie. Movie so powerful and brilliant as the field, the game shouted, in the name of Dad and Michael Collins following my left foot. These Irish films were considered very around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some, A wonderful period for Irish films. Leftovers are a powerful movie outstanding. Daniel Jouleys play Christy Brown's crippling so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy. My performance is two of the best film ever performances, especially Daniel day-to-Lewis performance that I would consider as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis has been proven in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie in the movie, see it!
