Rating "10/10" Piece Master <br /> Some years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that she would recover the movie here and there if she had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, I guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's list - is your best. Even Oprah believes in this one! <br /> <br /> What has got me most is realism in the story and drama. Stuff like this has happened and is still happening in the world.
