For anyone who can not know what a single-actor movie was like, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense. It's in all cliched situations, hacked lines, melodrama, comedy ... you name it! But Amitabh Bachchan can do nothing to convince, and this film is not by no means an exception. Everyone turns into a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But the Megastar is covering everyone with its immense presence. Without it, this movie would have a non-starter ... The story is about separation / misunderstanding / misunderstanding / love / hate / hatred / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a brilliant performance on any count, in a otherwise funny movie! And I mentioned that it is funny ridiculous?
