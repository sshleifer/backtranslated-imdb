All dogs go to heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about this one that makes it much better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is wonderful as the performances of Burt Reynolds, Deluise Dom, and especially Ken Page as the King Gator. "Let's make music together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie music I've seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
