When Gundam0079 became the film trilogy most of us are familiar with, many of it took action and less of anything else. This OVA is quite the opposite. Even though there are only half a dozen episodes, it's not filled with action, but emotional things. The two main sequences of this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing many gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilized-film film. This movie has done a fantastic job. What makes this movie stand out is showing both sides of the war are good and bad people. It made the eggs seem more people than the original movies where they are shown as the second rose to Nazi evil. Most people do not like to host that I was forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. So I would recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan, and you do not see that, you should not read this; you should already watch it now.
