My look became a bit too late but I'm happy to look at this and the end together ... that makes me compliment the musicians in this flick of giving such a pure and basic physique treatment romanticism ... and very much separate it from the relationship! As a lot wrote on the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight some portions of the movie that I personally liked. <br /> I think points where Jesse and Celine make phone calls to their respective friends were a very clever way to tell each other what they meant to each other on a trip by even 24 hours.

What the actors carry out is what gets into them .. right or wrong even those who bring their ideas would find it hard to justify ... to become the character, the life the actor has given to go beyond instructions and The story ... here both the actors do just the RIGHT WORK! Kudos .. !!! and before the sunset is another feather that makes this one even more beautiful!
