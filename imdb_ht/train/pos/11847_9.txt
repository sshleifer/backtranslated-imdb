The horse is indeed a fine animal. Pentecostal dreams of wild horses and their favor may never have been more majestic in an animated film. The animation is simply meaningful. The fine animation forms the skeleton of the beauty that the horses are embroidered across the flick. More so, when the stallion crosses various terrain, jumps through cliffs and brave waters. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack too is very impressive. The beautiful instrumental music attracts you to appreciate the movie. "They say that the history of the west was written from the device of a horse." Well, the story of a fine horse sure was written from the device to the west. <br /> At all, this movie is clearly up there and the best .It is one of the best flicking animations I have to watch. Should be a very good choice on a lonely night. A 9/10 easy.
