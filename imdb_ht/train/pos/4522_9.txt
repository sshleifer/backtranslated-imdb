This one took me by surprise because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past but kept the perfect balance of this performance, avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humor and real emotions. The always-wonderful Julie Waters is terrific here, and anyone who has not yet staged her in Rita educated Rita would rent her immediately (beautiful movie). The rest of the characters supported are well-played as well, very wonderful unique without going over the head. This one is fun.
