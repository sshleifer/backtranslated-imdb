This ensemble piece of adult who returns to the summer camp of the youth was a very quiet and exit movie in the autumn of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but then again, some of the best movies Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin people who suffer ... good here) is the group of actors who meat out these roles as those who were old and good, bad and funny memories of summer gone past. This movie covers the gambit of emotions, especially beautiful, and the movie never hammer goes to the viewer to feel what the characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to enter their memory on their own. Since I'm a visual movie maker who is going to be brisk, brass manipulation of films, this is something that I appreciate from Mike Binder's writer / director. This movie is a great cheap rent, a good tenant and even a nice sitting in a movie theater. You might run across this on TV, and I would definitely suggest a look-see.
