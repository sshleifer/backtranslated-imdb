... Do not read any resume because of the word scheme might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, acting in both Denzel and Dakota (it will go high sky, trust me on it) are just fabulous, and the draw is mind blowing. Actually "Fabulous" is a word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the trauma that I had during and after the movie. If you are both actors and a movie a bit disturbing, you still do not look at your favorite one again ... Trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... just do not miss it
