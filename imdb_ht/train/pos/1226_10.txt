This movie was filmed on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were the extra costs of this movie. Apparently there are some party scenes where they all drink beer (which they told me was watercolors, disgusting tastes, and it was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scene). But none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It has never been out of the theater (obviously) with it, as far as I knew, never released on video, and I'm sure not released on DVD. But it seems that it was seen by some, albeit it probably very few. So, there must be something. I would absolutely like to buy this for my brother, but there is no way I can get it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about where / how / how can this movie be purchased? And what format would be?
