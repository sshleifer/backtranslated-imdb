I looked forward to seeing this since I first saw her in her work list. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Channel Movie Forever. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson commented on being a "sweet funny story of 2 people crossing" they were killed. Writers probably should not get a bonus, everyone else SRO to make the movie. Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie should see it. Natasha's presence is so hot and smiling so electrically, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she's in to go on my favorite list. TVs and print interviews that I've seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking. <br /> <br /> God bless him, his family and future initiatives. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would also.
