I was so excited to see this movie because I always heard it was scary. What's interesting about it is that it's a Japanese movie they've decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it in Japan with the original crew! I think this movie was made to ... more Japanese (which is probably why he managed to fairly success unlike most Japan-to-America flip movie horrors) but he also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences . The difference in what Japanese culture crises and what American culture crises felt present throughout the film. This worked well at the time when they meant to take the nervous fear of the main character: a scary fish in a great, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond. <br /> <br /> The scenario was quite confusing too. In typical Japanese fashion it is very complicated and confusing. The start of the movie is actually among the story and from us we move constantly forwards and back until, at the end of the movie, we see the finish with the start of the whole story. This constant flipping of time was very confusing for me. Also, I did not think that some things were explained well and I asked my friends to explain to me (he had already seen it, as well as the end apparently revealing more of the story). <br /> Overall, there is plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freckled imagery and grim detail that a healthy splash in the scene of jumps.
