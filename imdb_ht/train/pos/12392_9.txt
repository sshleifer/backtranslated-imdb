The 'second beginning' as it is explained in title, shows us at the beginning of the end for the human race. Were long before the uterus existed, this short animated writing in the Wachowski shows us the world that could lie ahead of us in the distant future, putting in turn in the 21st century, the second revival delves into common problems and behaviors people; Greed, power, control, worthless etc .. The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. Renaissance Second is no exception to this concept, however instead of a simple layout vs. layout machine, this story explains the struggle that the cars are set up and the struggle to accept in a world led by people. Where the uterine films show us the human perspective, these short animations say both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> Part of the second revival 1 + 2, answering many questions that were brought to the original matrix film, such as how the war broke out, how the sky was blackened, which led to the use of people as batteries and it also introduces us to the car city dial 01, which may be of importance in the film of the upcoming Revolution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not give away too much of the story, as I do not want to ruin the experience for viewers perspective, however, I'll recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the uterus or simply any people interested in Japanese animation (animated). <br /> 9/10.
