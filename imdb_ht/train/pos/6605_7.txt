2054. Paris is a Escher draw with people and cars twisted together at various levels in a prominent homage to Metropolis Fritz Lang. Paris is both ultramodern and drooping in decay. And in the bat between sweeping surveillance, a pretty young medical singer kidnapped just after leaving his sister in a sedan nightclub. A police officer is difficult to investigate. The black and white black displays, with the gloomy corridors, shadowy corridors and single-cell lighting fixtures of the most difficult boiling-in noir films, the comparison of Sin City are inevitable. But the story must be more of Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than Frank Miller, as high-tech surveillance, near-invisible infantry and super-corporation infamous suits are as much a part of the landscape as weapons and cars. The film never thoroughly generates the fault-of-charge atmosphere in Gibson's Cyberpunk vision, with its marginal marginal burial character and industrial style from corporations that all seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer definitely gets the sense That future Paris is no utopia and future science less than blessing. And as the police line the unfolding procedure was taken from the darker embankments of individual ambition under the bright guise of cultivating the image of the Avalon corporation PR. The process of capture movement used here produces a look somewhere between B & W comic books and next generation rotoscoping, and is either captivating or persistent depending on your taste. But a great visual sense is on display here, and the future Paris is full of down to the small details to give the picture a unique look that is in both spartan and baroque. Send a look.
