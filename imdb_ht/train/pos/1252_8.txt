The endless limits of our humanity to our own quality have never failed for me. This amazing story of a terrible and abusive nonkilling abusive populace population is compelling, well-documented and uplifting. As an American, I'm still outraged by my country's behavior and this is just another of our time catalog of basic international. We suck. This is probably the first documentary I saw John Pilger, but he immediately made me want to see what else he was doing. My only complaint, and why I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesti and the appalling collaboration of U.S. and UK, asking that our viewers / citizens are accomplices of inaction our own ... but it does not make any suggestions on how to help. I do not know about Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to take part in government. A gesture in the right direction can help these islands.
