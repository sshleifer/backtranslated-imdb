A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So it is possible, not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera work, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, superb in any way - and very different from the garbage we are unfortunately using to receive. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. As everything else in this movie, he acts unique - it is completely his own - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else I have ever seen. There is something fascinating about it. Long, without breaking, natural shots are wonderful, remind us that we have become too familiar with a few restrictions on how to shoot and edit.
