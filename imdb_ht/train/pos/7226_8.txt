A bit typical bit of film in this era. Obviously, she first became pregnant in this world for the scene but yet a very good movie from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are doing their acting stage performances for silver screen and both do it effectively. There are so many in the way of history and anyone who is not familiar with this type of cut character stroke can be slightly put into it. All in all, though, A good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get too much.
