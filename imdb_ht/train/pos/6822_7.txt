"Opening Night" released in 1977, attempting to make an ambitious production. He succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. His character in actress Myrtle is not necessarily a person we would like in real life. It is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around him - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of the throat - we are not sure if the demons she is fighting them real or imagine, although we are leaving in on the early secrets. Rowlands is obviously well-directed and loved by her gifted husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This movie is not without flaw - it's too long, and the last part of the movie where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk looks pretty cruel. "Improvising" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on too long road. Some of the characters supported provide good performance, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtle's sneaky producer. Joan Blondell's charity never completely developed, and I could never know why he was in the movie, except for Myrtle. See this movie for Rowlands alone - it is fascinating at all - and it is difficult to take your eyes on it, although you'll want at times.
