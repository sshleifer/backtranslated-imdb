Guys and dolls have to be one of my favorite music movies ever. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. It defines those who have forgotten about musicals-musicals made to entertain, not preaching. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago that have lots of music and good movies but fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! She was very annoying to listen to her songs and talk when I could not understand her. If not for Marlon I would give 10 stars. Guys and dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely find these days. Look at her a good time!
