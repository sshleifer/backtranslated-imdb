In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in Great Britain (during the rule of George III's rule). This time, Blackadder's candidates are poorer - as instead of royalty, he is a servant of the very, very thick George IV (Regent in Price). Contrary to the historical accounts of George IV, this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result, the Blackadder can take advantage of him and his heart integrity plot. The only major difference in style between this one and the earliest is that the series ends on a very, very, very different score - you just have to see it to believe it. Other than that, all the normal story elements have and the show is hilarious. Only my reservation (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children due to its gross language and adult status.
