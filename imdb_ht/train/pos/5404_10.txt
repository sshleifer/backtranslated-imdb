Anyone who says Pok√©mon is stupid may die. This film is Supreme. I even stored a water when Celebei died. I do not criticize so much! This movie is a comedy anime comedy. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of Pokemon, Ash and Friends have to stop the fierce toll from making Celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his black ball. At this time, Sam and Celebei travel in time and continuously are hunted by game hunters. I love the party with the double fight with Sam having the pokeball apricot (if you've played pokemon gold, silver, or crystal, you know what it is.) I also enjoy having Miramax in charge instead brother warner. Put the mini movie to the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever.
