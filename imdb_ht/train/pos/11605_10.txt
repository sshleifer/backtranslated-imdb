The biggest reason I saw this film was that it star Susan Swift, an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress. Time travel movies usually do not interest me, nor are movie films about magic, but this film was fascinating and creepy. He did not rely on outrageous special effects and did not focus so heavy on the time travel that the viewer lost and confused. This was a really creative movie to keep simple and focused with great act by all.
