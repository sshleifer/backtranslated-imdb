I could not find anyone to look DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of one of the band. Of course everybody assumes you can only enjoy this movie if you like the music of either the Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of the two parallel groups is a perfect representation of the ways a band can take, and watching the public eat up and spitting out the Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with the other review that it would be good to get a final word from Anton himself, since it clearly shows his own worst enemy and the wallet of the band's ability to stay. I respect Dandys for the BJM (despite lack or lack of reciprocity) and to Anton (despite its irregular behavior). The Dandy Wars respected the art group produces even though the group hates everything Warhols's Dandy now stands for (although this is discussed). The best line is when the drummer for the Dandy says "I will not have to be anywhere new to me yet" and the guitarist unknowingly blurts out "I'll always buy the files though." For me, this just shows how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> Definitely see this movie, even if you do not know anything in either band. Read more about the themes of rock music and how to develop that makes this movie so interesting. It's rare to follow a group so well for so long.
