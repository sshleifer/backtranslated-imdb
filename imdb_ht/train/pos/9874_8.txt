In this 1943 film, Judy Garland judged not to be ready for the great time again by the man who loves it-Van Heflin. This movie was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after he had supported Oscar the year before in "Johnny eager." Are not Spring Byington too adorable to be widowed mother of 5 children, and four of them appear to look like her grandson? The singing and dancing are just stringent scenes, but the way romance in flowering between Heflin and Garland shows a lot to be desired. It was a Gigi who like a young girl eventually swept at her feet by a chic.
