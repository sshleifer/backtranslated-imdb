Wanted to see this Finnish film and I had to say it is one of the best films I've seen this year. The intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all taking place the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very nicely to the end, recalling, perhaps, a bit of the movie From the Tarantino. Most of the actors perform very well, most certainly necessary in dramatic realism of this type. I especially liked to act by Sanna Hietala, lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that the IMDB had received the wrong information about Sanna. His name, as you may have noted in my review;), is not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
