I was not sure when I heard about this out. I thought how dumb is Disney getting. I was guilty. I found it to be very good. I mean it's not the Lion King but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. It was very funny. Also, it was not one of these sexual sequences to Disney's animation was absorbed, it was just like the Lion Lion animation. The only thing that eritated me was the stuff everything stuff out of the movie. Do not give anything but you'll know what I'm talking about. I also am pleased that it was cool to have most of the throw from the original return. It was a very good movie about it all.
