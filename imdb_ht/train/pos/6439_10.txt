I went to see this film twice a week and could only sum it up in one word (which I normally do not use lightly): Wonderful! In my view, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards if not this Swedish crew has created Cinemas perfections in the recent scenes of the movie, when everything that has been said (and left insolent) throughout the story is drawn together? Just as character Danyus Dareus recalls for many feelings and regrettably long sentiments to those around her, the movie does the same to the viewers: You walk out with yourself abuzz and your heart feels full. Great stuff! Next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", perhaps reflect on how you feel after a rich experience as it is in heaven: happy, content, fulfilled. To tell it to Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway: "These are enough times."
