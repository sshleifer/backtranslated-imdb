Sublime is a way we have to reach for the beauty. And sublimity is the thing this movie is made in. If not, it's my favorite in all of Bogdanovich movies. This unique masterpiece reminds us, as most of the other films come from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, loss (or failure) with hope and faith and charity. As the songs from the films take its titles (Gershwin's well-known composition) the movie makes the impossible impossible, and try to let us know that no-one can judge anybody; All these things and lightness in a comedy with the distribution in a mastery direction (the first few minutes, and the detective these ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed on the looks and opinions of the characters - and this "Bogdanovich Touch" based on the point-of-view - is a class on Cinema Language, something that PB learned well from director admired in the Golden Age of the movies). With a superb cast and a glorious band (including the best of the "Trilogy" Sinatra), this film, full of self-esteem and compassion, and far from self-indulgence and video (as some critics wrote), deserve a better place on American Cinema History than where he was wearing. It's not "long on style, short on substance": it's complex of its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
