The first, I would like to make a correction on another review of this movie saying that the last music to win the Best Academies Academy Awards was' Gigi 'in 1958. That's bad information as' Side Side Story 'was in 1962,' Lady Fair 'I had in 1965 and' Sound of Music 'won years later. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has changed somewhat, but that's more because of the limits being on a stage that they just did not change back to a filmed version. However, I do not mind. In fact, I rather think the whole output flows better than the iron does. I love Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with him and being killed instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are those that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start from the outset of the governor's office. Support for this moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this movie were Jack Wild, who plays the best cake in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and funny Fajin (this character worked out better than it is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is stronger, the strongest version of Nancy. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two large production numbers that are 'consulting yourself' and 'who will buy'. I always hate when the choreography in the musical means to look like people doing daily work and work. It looks terrible and cheesy, especially when they dance to London meat co. They should just have regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
