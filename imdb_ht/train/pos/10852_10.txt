Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still crazy-holic. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV. Then I had to get the video tape finally to find out how it ended. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed first signs of rotten after a few weeks. After the DVD I put my hand on the soundtrack. Then, on several movie posters and script movie. Now, it gets worse that I try to push others into addiction with my website and still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could that happen? What drove me into addiction? <br /> <br /> OK, it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholy clever comedy as only British can produce. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is the world apart from such things as' 'This is Spinal Tape', because of the characters, non-childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story about men getting older, too. A story about people getting to each other. Or do not. He has some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy puts one of the best performances I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the band is incredible. The Mick Jones alien wrote the songs for the unusual fantasy film. Jimmy Nail plays bas-man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy who show egocentric singer but left Ray Simms really sing. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you've just heard Bill Nighy sing in "Actually Love", you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will be fever for each scene coming for the x-th time, especially those concerts. You would die to be able to stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruits are doing "all over the world," singing on the head of your lungs. You have long been crying and celebrating with thousands of people being reborn in the unusual real fruit at Wisbech's festival stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to strange fruits. If there is a world where this group really exists I would like to move. <br /> <br /> Got always crazy ... anyone?
