I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular film ... except when the arms and bullets started to fly. I must agree this movie will make anyone and everyone angry because it is to discriminate everyone with anyone .... but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. I recommend this to anyone who loves classic cult. Also try Fritz the Cat and the Nine Life of the Fritz Cat. If I'm incorrect Ralph Bashki did that movie too. It involves a chat that goes through hard times with family, street, work, etc. When I was old enough I rented all those movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during this era also marked as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made fresh worlds start a young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that faced life on a young man's street.
