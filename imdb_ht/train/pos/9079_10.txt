This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationships. As a bride for 26 years, I am empowered with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he is supposed to know that. I also like her monotonous delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A beautiful ensemble of characters. This will be a nice addition on Monday night line-up. <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best enjoyed in small doses. It also seems a little old to always be troling for women. <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series developed.
