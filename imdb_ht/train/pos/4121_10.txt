This one tends to get lighted by a lot of critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I thought it was wonderful. It is a multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest, who lives in a city literally made from garbage. Though it looks like a A-bomb just hit, the movie has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the power of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound by the crazy young man who leads an imaginary trolley in the slum. All the characters were beautiful and all the stories are rude, but perhaps the most tragic man's concern with his young man who lives in an abandoned machine. When they do not seek food, they spare time by using their imagination to build their dream home. An emotional movie moves and beautiful.
