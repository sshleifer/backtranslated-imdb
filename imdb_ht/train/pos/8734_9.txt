The movie was totally awesome and cool. The graphics were superb and it was amazing, Especially, Flik was superb and awesome in the movie and it was funny and it was and sometimes it was intelligent. The Circus Bugs are colorful and superb in the movie. The primers were also superb and cool in the movie. Hopper was a cruel and better quality. Even Dot was beautiful. When the bird comes to feed their animals, the scene was superb and good. Even the last scene was frightening and cool. Even the Flick invention was good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to strive away from the cricketers. When the ants builds the artificial bird, which scene was good and beautiful I should really appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
