... and I mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen all the movie ever created!), At least, obviously, among them, many of I know. The rule of thumb and IMDb is this: sometimes movies are very pretty (for example, pieces of Campaign-Composition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely a worth watching movie is actually rated under 6. This movie, much worth watching, is. A shame. <br /> True, I give it a 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. Its true rating should be an 8 or 9. It has some defective acting (Belafonte specifically), the script travels around, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who leads two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, greatest-than-life zero Mostel and Sublime Ida Kaminska in a poet / poetical / moral journey of strength. A pair made in the sky! It is true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not hang the average audiences, but those who are interested in looking an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) film of the incomparable director who gave us " Shop in Main Street "(the best ever ever on Holocaust) should not miss this just because some IMDb comic rating systems have decided that" Indian Beauty "is better than the" Levine Angel ".
