The performances of this film were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric has delivered a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this beautiful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far from the superior to the "Grifters", which was a good movie, this movie really lived true in the fiction / movie film fiction in which the story came. I recommend this movie to all movie noir fans.
