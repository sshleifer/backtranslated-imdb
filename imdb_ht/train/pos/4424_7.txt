As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an animated- and Hong Kong-inspired samurai action flicker movie with a peaceful message. This ankle in the film is effectively described by the protagonist (a great act of act performed by Daisuke Ryu), a killer-turn-to-bodjist-monk Benkei. Benkei has sworn never kill yet, but he always takes up sword to fight what he thinks is a devil invasion. <br /> Gojoe is a hard movie rate. It's in visual imagery is stunningly stylish and beautiful, but it uses a lot of twick (character camera and high speed drives, expressive shots, liquid colors, digital effects etc.), so the end result is somewhat tiring. That said, the beginning and end of the movie are nevertheless both elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would be wise enough not to embrace her bag of tricks. Other issues with Gojoe are the number of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violent message Gojoe waste way too much energy and screen time to show endless battle scenes. Also, the way to show the violence is always on the edge of being self-sufficient; In fact, a shower against the night sky seems to be one of the movie signature images. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic times of violence as well. Still, it seems that Ishii is not sure if he is doing a traditional action movie or a deeply algorithm. The audience can not be sure of this, either, until the very end of the movie. Powerful (albeit cynical) ending is what is going to Gojoe; It is clearly emphasized that this movie is something more than just a gore-fest.
