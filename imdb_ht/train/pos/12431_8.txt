Well, in truth, I saw the forecasts for this movie and think myself, what are the producers thinking? Hutton, Jolie, and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor possibly compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But amazingly, the two were kind of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor matches Jenkie's with fire. As for Hutton, he plays the very beautiful psychic, contrasting and David's calm delivery of life threatening situations. In general, I was very impressed with the development of writing and character. I gave her 8 stars.
