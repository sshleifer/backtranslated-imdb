In a series of trauma-full of brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my many favorites. It's not the most profound episode, there is no great significance or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some fine performances. But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is, in my knowledge, * * * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * scheduled finish. The area is famous for giving a great surprise to the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise, and think this, but it turns out there's another surprise * waiting. I just like that so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented one).
