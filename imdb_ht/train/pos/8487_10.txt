I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a kid and my mother, and wonder why she would still cry in the past few minutes. I, of course, found the whole hilarious movie, particularly the manners of the characters. It was not until I was older and looked at her again as I realized how deeper this show actually is. Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shone in their role as mediators are reluctant. Keaton stopped surprising me with his real life style of line delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and pathetic to the mix. I also thought Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply awesome in his role as the comic relief. <br /> I think this film is one of the most underrated films in the 80s. We all can learn a lesson in the merger of the American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you really * may * have "the best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt the way he did in these closed times. I'd rather have one of these cars, too.
