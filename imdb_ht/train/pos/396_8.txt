Legend of Zu <br /> I remember well Tsui Hark's original warrior made 18 years earlier. More than a Christmas, in a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week in Hong Kong cinema, Zu warrior was so attracted to a very young viewer with his brother, and so memorable, that he was engraved in memory in the now growing up wonder ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original Warriors is one of the earliest films I've seen as a kid I can clearly recall story lines and the action scene. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in the first classics. So, when I saw this rumor of Zu warriere, there was a sentiment of arrest. Could he beat memories of toddlers in my dreams of having the original, or it will follow the path of other rumors and die a death more terrible than the wicked and broken bouts you get from those cinema fu? The answer is that I can not say. But that was because this is not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The legend of Zu Zu in the story of King Sky, a lone warrior, whose master, Dawn, declares his love for him, call insomnia. Two hundred years later, insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as enigmatic, and insomnia has returned to destroying Zu. Meanwhile White and Red Sources try, with the help of King Sky, to stop insomnia. The draw is not a full one of twists and turns, but there was enough detail in it to keep me interested. But I can see this movie as one either you love or hate. The movie is a lot of special effects, and the majority of it involves several computer generated products, much like the Storm Rider and a man named Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that was not too much graphics and everything was tasteful. Nothing appears to rush - unlike heroes. The schedules were complementary to the act and not in all the potent scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also involves many characters and the intermingling of many people making the film intriguing. He was probably on the verge of his 'overcrowded' but generally every character was part of it in the story. But some of the roles seem to be 'prolonged cameos' in my opinion, and I somehow left a little the issue of this necessity. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play central role in the movie, but I could not say that this movie showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung looks at least mature in her act, but she's still quite raw. Kelly Lin was new revelation for me. Despite her very short roles, I have apologized and admitted to ogling! <br /> <br /> In general, I said, enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the 'original'. Given that both cinemas were made by Tsui Hark's legend, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how films in Hong Kong have changed over two decades. With one beauty of which is the fact that you can not really compare the two films at all, as much as the apples are apples and beans are weight. Finally, both are quite enjoyable movie of their own right. And I'll be back to reminisce not to look the original again. <br /> Two look, but not comparing.
