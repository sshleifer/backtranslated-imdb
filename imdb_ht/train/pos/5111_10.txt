Does anyone know what type of pickup John T has been driving? I look forward to the late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and lately found another like it. I would like to restore the collection I have to look like on the movie. Also, the music was frightening, and the act was great. Where and what does the woman have to show her aunt Jan? Also did John have a double cap for the scene on the tower when he was almost gone? Also, that year Mustang made Debra W driven in this show. It looked like the 60 model. Thanks,
