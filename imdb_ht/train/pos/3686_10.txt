Diane and I've seen this fabulous movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that in the pastiche films she was head and shoulders above the rest. I say that because we were approaching by short, five to ten minute segments composed of the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was loved in its many forms. > <br /> Officially the movie took place in various Parisian arrondisements so giving a particular taste in each segment. Having just been in Paris several times, I was not aware enough to easily recognize their location, but I'm sure Europeans and particularly French people could easily recognize the location of the city. In any event, the viewer is instantly pulled into each story because of their production excellence so the cities in the city fade into the consequence. The movie moves quickly and the viewer lets absorb single storyline while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic as some Hollywood Cancer bands, are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as and most of life without Swath's media that attach much to life's beauty under the nearest dump just to sell , sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care for and allow this little magic movie to bath you as a spa treatment and when you let my guess is you will feel renewed.
