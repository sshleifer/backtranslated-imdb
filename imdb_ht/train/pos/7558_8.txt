This episode comes out in the first quarter a little on the opposite side of the controversy and the whole angle of sex. I imagined there would be a significant amount of correction before it ended tempering. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and directed is complemented by the fine act. (Nicholas Lea makes his first X-Files though not as Krycek Agent, but as a victim called Michael) I especially enjoyed the build and end up in his head. <br /> <It's different but enjoyable.Ignore any bad reviews you can hear. See it for yourself and then trial.
