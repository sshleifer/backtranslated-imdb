We are talking about a low budget film, and it is understood that there are some weaknesses (there is no deflector: a sudden explosive expert with a single alcohol); but in general the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are likable and have some original situations. I really love films that surprise you and some people that do not want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ... I applaud this one on that. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) a movie in Argentina.
