actually ... that "video camera" effect is just that, it's an effect, a good rather good .. (u do not know much about directing a movie you?) this movie is in fact better than the original, It's great fun to watch, made for TV, do not have to follow any rules. I find it hard to look at number 1 because of how she killed the first girl, disturbing her. and all the time we're routing for Judd Nelson to get away with it, we're like the viewers on his side. I hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but I doubt it. Watching this movie you can understand how real movies are made, as this is sort of like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the scoundrous villains ever, and it is much more realistic, it's not just mindlessly cut people like in other horrors.
