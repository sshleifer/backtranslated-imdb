Often laughing loudly, sometimes sad story of 2 divorced work guy - Lemmon a neat neurotic "husbands house" and Matthau a sportswriter escort - who decided to live together to cut down on spending. <br /> <br /> Nicely photo and directing. The very reliable scripts - that is, there's always more than one side almost every line. Particularly funny scenes involve British siblings (Evans and Shelley) who seem to be embarrassed by everyone who says, but when Lemmon busts out his picture of their children and, yes, the ex-wife- They have the girls complaining with him before Matthau can show up with the promise beverages! <br /> <br /> Very fun.
