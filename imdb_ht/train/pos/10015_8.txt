Popular Radio Gabriel Gabriel Nobody (Robin Williams, stubborn and speaking in tone, hypnotic tone) gets acquainted with friends and a boy fourteen boy from Wisconsin named Pet Logand (Rory Culkin), who was Write a detailed book of sexual abuse from its parents. For boots, Have AIDS and this is forcing Gabriel more, since his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to be a survivor of HIV himself. She also knew herself and Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) And when Gabriel decides she wants to meet and talk to two of them in person and go to Wisconsin, she discovers some secrets she ( Of course) do not prepare to get. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin (which co-wrote the scenario with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves a lot faster (90 min, maybe a few minutes again) than one might think a movie in this genre would run. That's good in that it keeps the action with lean and clear scenarios. It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and does not sew-up any of the scheme openings or back stories. I would rather not go into any big detail except saying, if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's work or his personal story, you feel a little out of the village here. Still, the performances by Williams (I'd love to hear more of his narratives, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and many of the support (The waitress in Donna's restaurant Chocolate's do a great job with that little its part has!) is top-notch and the mood is established here - namely, chilly, lonely exterior dark in Wisconsin and New York - giving a terrific frame for this story. It may have ends that are not tied together quite well, but it's still a compelling enough stick to them.
