I went to this movie at a casting show and crew to cause my friends, who is a producer on the movie to invite me. Forget what you've seen in the advertisements, forget what you've heard, go see this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by it. In a world of Grinch, Charlies Angels, the 6th Day, Unbreakable, here comes a movie worth your hard earned bucks! Glorious scenes, cute cynics and a throw you want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of the most intensified and reasonable films of the year. Robert Deniro deserves a shaking oscar. If you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package, this would be the movie.
