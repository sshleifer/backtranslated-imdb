A very interesting documentary on Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose works consist mainly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of stone, leaf, grass, ice, etc., which gets swept away when the tide reaches the beach or the wind blows in the garden. So, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really pass, except as photos or films of these were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's work is a reflection of mortality, or the word's effect, but it is not easy to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotypes on artists are that they are mostly bitter, firefighting, often mentally unstable people living in urban decades, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and Life in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure these are the same reasons why it was shunned by some people on the art world that found its work fluffy or superficial).
