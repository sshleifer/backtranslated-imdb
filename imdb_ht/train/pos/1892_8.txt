After seeing Arthur on television many times I laughed at Dudley Moore's hard work as Arthur a happy go lucky millionaire drunken was hysterical but John Gielgud as his father / father Hobson was equally good. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of almost 27 years it's still as enjoyable as she's ever been Liza Minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic. /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a drunken millionaire who has a low bill that reads as the national debt he has no desire to grow and enjoy acting as a child. His activity is supervised by his dry butler Hobson (Gielgud) circle that nobody really cares for Arthur except for her, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he is not blonde social blond social Susan Johnson (Eikenberry ) in four weeks he will cut his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars. <br /> However Arthur met and fell in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli) a young working waitress and tied robbers, now he is facing a tough decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson died Arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with Susan before the wedding, let him keep both the money and his true love. Arthur is a truly enchanted romantic comedy for everyone
