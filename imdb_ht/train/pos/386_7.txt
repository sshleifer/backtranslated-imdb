Tsui Hark's visual art is in her view of this movie. Unfortunately awful act by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt encouraged to choke her while watching this, it's bad :) made it hard to look at times. <br /> This film is a real tool in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw fell repeatedly and I thought I had never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to make full justice in the mythical world of Chinese historic koun-fu woman! Without a doubt this is one of the best-looking Chinese historical Kung Fu fuji ever. <br /> But, Tsui Hark has not improved much of the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather juvenile (his apparent manicure and the funny and over-the-counter storage of the evil guys did not help swa). To make it worse, this movie is very seriously dropping. They decide to use the "hot" popular Hong Kong islands as lead characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally flawless for historic Kung-Fu drama because they lack the nobility and mysticism that these characters are supposed to incorporate . Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> I wish that one day Zhang Yi-Mu and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a film with the visual art of Tsui but with mature and poetry story of Zhang.
