This episode is somewhat confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but I said I was a bit confused from the beginning! Clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and is making fun of believing it is a superhero. Clark said that the life he knew was all in his head. Delusional. He also found some strange things: Martha married; Lex is tied to a wheelchair and branches off after his crash on the bridge; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds one familiar; another was devoted to Clark: Chloe. He also found that a mental patient also is in the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is a escapee from the Phantom area. This episode reminds me to go back to a Buffy episode called "Normal Again" where Buffy begins to have life-dreams about a mental asylum. The doctor tried to persuade her that all she knew was a figure of imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy. His parents were still married, still living in LA, his friends did not exist, his angel never had his companion and did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors do not just tell the characters that it's all a face of imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. It's good, though, there is a sense of reality every once in a while, but we look at these shows to escape from reality. It's still nice because the characters have overcome their new challenges.
