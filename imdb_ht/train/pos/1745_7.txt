How genuinely friendly, charming and warming is this unpretentious old series; I was glad to see old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a long lost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these seriously serious series.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonist. It refreshes the idea. It's not stupid; Stupid ones are people who do not find the terms on which these series work. CHANDU has an unstoppable sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. Chandu is an occasional magician who also goes by the Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a circle of assassins. <br /> <br /> As Chandu exercises its supernatural gift in a rather secret and moderate way. <br /> As on the nude quite sexy, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest in Ubasti: The Vindhyan sordid. The sexy girl girl is in fact multiplied kidnapping ?? in a sarcophagus after they sleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; not an angry policeman; The temple of Lemuria and its unusual, ceremonial ceremonies resembles the KING Kong's imagery, and is a barbaric atmosphere in the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl as guts like Chandu do? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and charming, mean drink, and this only contributed to his performance. It is the prototype meant to drink the uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This would sound like a crooked homage instead of Lugosi ?? Burton's biopic again in Wood left me this impression on Lugosi and his allies a strong sympathy for the actor to decorate. I love Lugosi's fancy performance <br /> <br /> This is unjustly bashed series.
