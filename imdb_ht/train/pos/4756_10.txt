This is one of the more adorable episodes in the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogue and fun characters to break the tension in some creepy moments. Has the usual blonde vamp "dancer" (what's up to Serling's tenderness for that kind of character, as he holds the show of various episodes?) And other assorted characters, but it's "old man man Jack" totally steal the show. I consider this the comic, light-hearted version of "The Monsters Will Due to Maple Street" - or, perhaps, a 20-minute parody Twilight Zone of the "Thing." On another note: I thought the young lover of the episode would be someone who eventually went to something else - he looked accustomed - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappears after just two TV credits in his name.
