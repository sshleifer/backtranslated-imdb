From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. It's annoying to have to look at the stereotypical librarian librarian to take his glasses and become beautiful and stupid to win a man. Especially like a deep and unstable man. It is obviously a player (I do not believe him to remain true) who does not want to settle down, who only looks at dull woman attractive and always calls them "baby" (i!). Even after she totally changed her appearance and her life for her, she just went to her after she (supposedly) rejected another woman and learned that Connie spends all her money upgrading her boat. I wanted him to stand before him, not pathetically chasing him! Sudden conversions in a few minutes were totally unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I've done like the movie. How can you not love the sailors to dance with each other? (You can say that they came from San Francisco ...; D) The "Repetition" dance was great, watching gorgeous Rogers giants falling in and out of the "correct steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with the beautiful costumes and the art of decor was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We've seen the sea" (though they used it a few times too much, as if they had achieved it was the best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the draw was a bit weak, like most musical (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dance was worth watching the movie for. I wish they could show some San Francisco vaccine since the movie was supposed to wear. <br /> It is also strange to see as a lighthearted naval film and knowledge of what Hitler has already been doing at that time. I have to try to stop all knowledge of submarine myself in a fantasy land made.
