Back in the 3rd room is the comedy end of the 36th season in Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monster and awesome fighter. At the end of this Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn Kung Fu after causing his friends to beat. She imitates the original Shan Te, trying all kinds of tricks to get into the Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually become some unique skills to fight with some bullying bosses. It is a classic light art martial arts history, with the ace production values ​​of the Shaw brothers and the sure footing location of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic at all, whether for fighting or comedy slapstick and Gordon Liu's performance, as the others, particularly sympathetic monk works perfectly for the material. The movie is less seasonal or profound than some of the other stars work and there are certainly grander, more violent and sweeping movie Shaw brothers. But some have such a magical mix of slapstick, unique training and battles, and a subtle story again warmed to a useless guy to do good. Full of joy happy heart, its impossible does not give this bigger note.
