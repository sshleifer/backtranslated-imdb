After toning good reviews on this movie I decided to take it for a turn (I bought it on DVD, hence "turning" pun ... I'm a dork). The beginning was all I was hoping for, a perfect set-up (along with some quotes that I heard about various Wu-Tang albums) in what would be a good movie. But the plot I heard was so great, was so predictable. Each time I saw a character (except for the lizard) I guessed that Venom it was. Plus, only the cool character killed killed in the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot was not good but at least was some good kung-fu right? Move. The battles were very short and few and far between. Granted different styles were all pretty cool, but I wish the battles lasted longer. I kept hoping to see the run of lezar and making some crazy crazy about the walls but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede make some tight schedule but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes total but it never happened. In short, not much is happening. The battle is full of beautiful routine. Do not be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one.
