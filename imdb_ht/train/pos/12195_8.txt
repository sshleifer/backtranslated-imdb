Any movie in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph all the way to third people and Joseph Cotton. It is also wonderful in a Touch of Evil. Please see them all! It tends to get firefighter and self serving in films such as F is for fake, really stupid movie films. Do not waste your time watching it. it's really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone studying movie should see everything he has filmed. All his leading ladies are tremendous, but the end of Welles has become a fat drink, like his character in a touch of evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way to women and I saw how he could be considered attractive to his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, and on my hand digress ... and because I'm a woman, I can see the attraction of her. She (Orson Welles) is one of the latest movie films and unless you count the movie-makers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the movie makers just do not measure up to the movie queen musicians ! I know there are many more movie makers today, but in such a short amount of time I can not name them all. There is no offense in any of the great movie makers of this millennium! August 21,2006. Please remind me of some current ups and coming movie makers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some of these films out now, but rarely have any I'd put on a "best 100" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, so was "Fargo", and "Oh, Fee , where are you, "from a line to Sullivan's journey; Another fine film from the quarantine! Can anyone give me a better list for the 90 and up to 2006? I would like to know who they look! Thanks! Also Appropriate of this website! Where else can you plug a movie or boo it! I love the ranting and havoc in regular ways like me who can tell what I want and I promise not to spoil any movie for someone who has not seen it again!
