This film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most sophisticated viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the finest film actors in the last 50 years. Its performance, comfort, disgust and humorous concussion while leaving you breathless. This film was shot in the very early days of his film career and very raw, but still able to convey the mastery of Depardieu. A must-see for any Depardieu fan and not far better his early work.
