Let's start by saying that this English title in the "Power of Kangwon Province" is a absolute misnomer.It is because of the Hong Sang Soo film, there is no current shots of war, problems and conflicts. So ideas to establish power in a province is neither proper nor valid in the context of this film.If we have judged this film by its Korean title, "Kangwon-do ui him" that will appear as a crypt statement emotional tormentation of its protagonists whose minds are not at rest.Hong Sang Soo also led a very visual visual document on irregular choices made by people in their lives. People in question are a couple of girls who are constantly in the process of displaying humor, fantasy and imagination. If they make a movie out of anything that can be claimed as a movie maker's worth of meritur then Hong Sang Soo was to sit early as a courageous movie maker who has filmed talking about the ubiquitous pervasive human relationships, feelings and life. That one likes it or not, this is just the fair conclusion that must be deduced from this particular film.
