Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you saw it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion in the movie will definitely change. The first time you see the movie you see the love-story hidden and think: oh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it's just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, then d ** ship will shed ??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. Acting in this movie is not bad, but definitely not great either. Was I happy DiCaprio was not an oscar for that movie, I mean who she thinks is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? She makes one-half good movie and will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. Then everyone is suprised that there is hardly any movie with him in it. But enough on, in my eyes, the worst character of the movie. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also think the director is very talented to put a movie in such a magnitude together. There is only one lesson to learn about this movie: there is too much love story as it is, filmmakers should not try to add a novel romance to every single movie !!! From a possible 100% I give this movie one 71%.
