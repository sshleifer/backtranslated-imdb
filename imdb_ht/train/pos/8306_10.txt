Actually they could not have chosen a better diverse actor to show Little Richard than Leon. It captures Little Richard into a most credible sense. The wonderful place and anyone watching this film will definitely keep a smile on the faces across the entire movie. Although the film is short, it holds your attention to the personality and team of Little Richard in mind. The latter should take a step toward moving Little Richard more in the present where you can see it as it was the age of the new millennium. It will still be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I'm concerned whatever the other media say.
