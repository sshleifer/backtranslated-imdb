In a word ... amazing. <br /> I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another lamenting film about the partition and would show prejudice towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws. I was haunted by her after watching it. It's delaying my head for a long time; The terms, pain, loss, emotions - all were so real. This is really a masterpiece that one rarely sees in Bollywood nowadays. He has no prejudice or prejudice and has given the partition a human story. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are Indians evil, Pakistani evil and good Indian and Pakistani. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melody, meaning (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunted. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the act just took my breath away. Everything was perfectly thrown. <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie ... look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how excellent it is.
