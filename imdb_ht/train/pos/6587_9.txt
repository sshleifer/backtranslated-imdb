The Blackmailer's master, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first feature of Sherlock Holmes's story with Jeremy Brett that I saw. The story is interesting and black. The film has a little sad, sad feel, but it is quite fun (with some especially funny scenes). <br /> <br /> Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson try to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who broke some of the most important families in England by publishing private letters that will, in one way or another, destroy life. They eventually find that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer," following the tragic consequences for victims who can not afford. Our hero must be the next help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is beyond its means or else its upcoming wedding will be most definitely to be called. The scene in which Holmes and Watson burglarize Milverton's homes are intense. Although the film has a truly happy ending, the tone is sad and sorry. Exceptional performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), with Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize her today as Cornelius Fudge of Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involved with Holmes are a riot). I give it a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I wish they would add to the scene at the end of the short story where it gave the description of the two burglars, one of which Watson matches.)
