This film is worth seeing for Jared Harris's exceptional portrait of John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris does not exactly match Lennon; its styles, expressions, posture, accents and attitudes to most Lennon. Best scene: Lennon at a local cafe verbally with a fancy fancy as to whether Paul McCartney & Wings "Funny Love Song" is worthy of # 1 status in America.
