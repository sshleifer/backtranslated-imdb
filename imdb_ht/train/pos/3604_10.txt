I think it's a great movie. because you get to see how Diana's life is at home. she was very aggressive, and she wants to prove that girls can fight too. I think he and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I'm Boxing too. It really impressed me. The negative part I think. They end. because it is well between Diana and Adrian. But you do not get to see how it is at home. And I did not really like it that you also do not get to see how his father is doing, and his brother. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'll watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you do not like boxing, you get to see a lot more than just boxing. I had a great time watching it.
