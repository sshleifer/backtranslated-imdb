A sweet little movie that would not even offend your grandmother, "Grace's Saving" looks off from the same fabric as a half-dozen other British comedy over the last two years ... Losing is faced with adversity , get the strength of challenge and learn something about himself / herself in the process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He did it all wrong, so Grace helped him out. They realize that it is the perfect human skin crop, which can both benefit from. She enjoys smoking, she needs to raise money to pay for her mortgage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> Blethyn is still watchable, and you can not say that about a lot .. well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Caryo, whom I love in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> Not deeply moving or perspicating, but amusing fun, and in an animated 90 minutes, feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
