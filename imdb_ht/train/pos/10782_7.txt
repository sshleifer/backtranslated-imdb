Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated man and an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. She does not have any trouble getting nude dancers but when she starts sex with this boy when she loses her. He believes that when women actually do this sex when they lose any sense of "innocent" and / or "beauty". So he pushed into Hollywood Hills following their lovemaking couples at a distance, finally firing the dead men with a high-powered rig with power and a scope. The main reason for this film's existence is to appreciate the sexual activity over and over again. The "story" comes as more of a reflection. This is bound to make a lot of heterosexual men happy as we treat at the scene pretty much nudity (ladies here look awfully good sense) and sex serves as a major dose of tattoos. Of course, seeing a deal just in it's a scope of creepiness factor considerably and shows the constraint towards voyeur. (For one thing, Mike Eyes couple in the dimension for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) This is all inspired by awfully intrusive if a bit atmospheric music on the soundtrack. Trendy for liquid trash are bound to enjoy this in one degree or another. It even contains one lesbian triangle that confuses Mike and makes him uncertain * how * reacts. It unfolds at a very slow speed, but ends with a most fun tissue. It's a rude and tough game that if nothing else will definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> 7/10
