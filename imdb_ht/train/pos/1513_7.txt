This film is another horror anthology. It is rather good, but it could be a bit more used. I compared it to the "Doctor's House of Terror", though in this one's title fits. It has four stories all a bit connected by a home. The first story is about a writer with his wife moving in. He creates a killer for his latest novel, and then he begins to see the killer roaming around in his home. This one is sort of predictable, but it throws a few twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the heck will be. This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch. This guy buys the house, but it is not the house that takes center stage, but a rather strange museum wax. The third story begins out rather good and features Christopher Lee. This one has her as a rather rare father who seems awfully the protection of her daughter. The problem is that once you know what will be about the story does not end soon enough. It shooter a bit that leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final story an actor's anxiety buying a dress from an odd little store. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a tiny story about an officer who sees at all trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why things happen. Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I do not think it really explains Cushing's story much of all. I think they need a little more story back for one. All at all if it was an interesting series of stories.
