The musicians chose the best people for the job and put the beautiful scene. Each interior is every detail that tells you all about people who live in it. Whether the period is 20s (the first story), present (ie 1950) for middle stories, or 1910s (latest), costumes and environments with observing and creating love. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - lace skirts covered by the most beautiful shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind soppy teen lovers, it's Raymond Huntley as the man who hates his wife's health and independence that pulls our emotions. It usually played funny, kind of firefighter, but here it is subtle and convincing and very impressive. China's ocean (great film 30s starred Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from Mr Knowing the whole episode (and also licked a story by Kipling). I wish we had seen more of Naunton Wayne as her jealous husband - even though she had a good time looking saddened in a Mexican hat. I like chic birds that play his wife, too.
