Rock Star: INXS was the best music series I ever watched! It has some of the greatest rock songs ever written, made by 15 highly talented musicians / performers. It was also (in my opinion) most heart-felt, feeling-good, the surprise end to all television reality. It actually makes me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! More than 13 weeks in this televised competition, the audience looked familiar and became familiar with all competitors. After the 30-bit remaining betting competitors seemed to be more like friends than just some aliens more competing against each other on a reality show television. With the fact that INXS was, and still, one of the largest stone rolls ever rolled into emotional strains created by this wonderful reality series. If you do not have the recorded series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
