So I rent "Still crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo of the guy in the video store, he said that sounded like Always Crazy. So I rent it. Did I disappoint? Well, yes, as always crazy focus on a classic rock band rather than a lot of punk, but that's OK. Always crazy telling the story of the weird fruit, a rock band breaking through the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a great rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members are all struggling to make a living, and they offer the opportunity to play a concert in the twenty-year anniversary of this festival. They took the bid and decided to reform on a permanent basis, touring Europe in the process. There are some very funny traits, and all the characters go through subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer in a documentary carefully edited than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
