The odd couple is a funny gem. One of the funniest script ever engaged in celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove, Epina Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: Felix obsessive compulsive and sloppy, irresponsible to Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because it is impossible to live due to his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife left her at the start of the movie, and after a suicide attempt to abolish she moved with Oscar's poker friends. That's when fun begins. <br /> <br /> The script is all brilliant and full of glossy one-liner covered. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." Jokes but still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic distance. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus from the diner and when the Pigeon sisters were loaded by a very inappropriate Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his elements. This one requires rehearsing view!
