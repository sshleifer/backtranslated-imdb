When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was dragging in this movie, my expectation that I would watch the movie all been given. The only reason I gave her a chance to have Julie Walters's beautiful and the recommendation of a friend. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a great "Madam Doubtfire" kind of mashed back has a gentle and meaningful comedy. Pasdar is entirely credible and sympathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to drop part of the girl by being cross-dressed on occasion. It transmits these needs to the audience in a well-credited fashion. Julie Walters is beautiful, it's her habit, as the owner who teaches her unconscious love.
