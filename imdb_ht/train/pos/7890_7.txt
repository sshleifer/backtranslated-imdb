Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the latest film featuring Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or co-star). The years of the killings took a toll on the town of Springwood. It has gotten to the point that the little town has become a virtual ghost town. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago all paid the final cost. Only the mad left the city and the survivors are scattered. But this does not stop Freddy from seeking out his final revenge. No matter how to try it, it always comes back for more. But this time he finds a little more about his old life. Have the kids finally stopped Freddy for good? What is the secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out that you will observe Freddy's Dead. completed the original filmed at 3-D. <br /> A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and gets out of a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star at this latest installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A whole lot better than the last one but it's full of a few jokes dating. If you enjoy the series then you do not want to miss out on this one. <br /> I have recommended this movie to Freddy fans.
