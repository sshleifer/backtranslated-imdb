For a "budget no" film this stone. I do not know if the America will love it, but we've laughed all the way through. Some really funny funny things. Really non Hollywood. Actresses and Music Launch. Cars and gags and even less in the face of your face split up. Whooo Whooo! <br /> I've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've seen in advertising or something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got a copy of a friend one of the actors.
