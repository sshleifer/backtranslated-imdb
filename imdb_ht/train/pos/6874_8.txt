A series of stickers, many of them spoofing television in the 1970s, but also with some searches from the government and America's venture. One of the longest segments, "The dealers" is not funny for me and I do not know what it is parodying. Some of the others, though, are absolutely side-divide. I particularly enjoy the cooking show segment. Most of the bad words I know are used in the movie and, if your object is full of nudity before, stay away.
