I was able to catch this movie at a screening in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; It has a lot of wacky characters, but let's just say I would have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh harder, I would not know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well-acting. <br /> There are many small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has a few "appliances" that pop up and add another hilarious layer. It is refreshing to look; By some recyclable things I would see many times before. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real crowd-pleaser, the story is so original and sincere. There's a lot here love, funny back-story, bad and misunderstandings that set up the final act and dramatic conclusions. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of hearts; It's a touch story and fast comedy tucked into all. Definitely worth seeing!
