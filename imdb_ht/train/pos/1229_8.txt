I waited for ages before to see this as all the comments I read this was said to have been awful! I rent it expect the worst, and while it is hardly the best film sandler out there, there are many worse! Sandler often speaks to the camera and the movie does not take it seriously, but that's all part of the fun! A good way to waste an afternoon, and you might even find yourself laughing once once! A good movie, well worth renting!
