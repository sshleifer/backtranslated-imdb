The children I took in this movie loved it (four children, ages 9 to 12 years, would give it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the title role. (Hoping to see more of Roberts's next generation in the future.) After being exposed to the love of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not seem to have worked the streets. Also enjoyed seeing a support throw including Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with a call by Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: nice movie. <br /> (Note: I did not read the book's series, so my comments are based on the merits of the movie alone.)
