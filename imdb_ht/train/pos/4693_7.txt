Johnny dangerous falls completely into the hit or missing category and its gags enclose with complete lack of a complete script or story that makes no sense. But that's the point, right? The cast is unmatchable; Michael Keaton is an excellent comedy scene before he takes himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all do with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughter from me. But the full scene scene here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word "Iceholes" in movie history) as a mobster that is the best price to kill the English language. <br /> I associate a lot of children's memories with this movie, as I watch it quite often so maybe I'm prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny is dangerous at least a totally innocent gangster complex that even brings some meaningful messages to the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> I love it but it is hard to recommend. <br /> <7 out of 10.
