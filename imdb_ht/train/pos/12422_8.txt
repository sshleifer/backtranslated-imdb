With the mixed reviews this got I was not expecting too much, and it was pleasantly surprised. It is a very fun small crime movie with exciting characters, excellent portraits, writing this breeze without being glued, with a good pace. It looks good too, in a funky way. Apparently people either like this movie or just hate it, and I'm one who liked it.
