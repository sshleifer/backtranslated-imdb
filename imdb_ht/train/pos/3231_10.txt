Soldier is not a big movie, and everyone who hates it has many good reasons. But I love the many soldiers, partly because my expectations were so low that I saw my wonder. <br /> First, the art direction is tight and well-executed. As far as science fiction goes by, soldiers did things with more design then 90% of the genre. The compositions, costumes and accessories were all consistent and fully executed; I did not like all of the future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this movie was worth the time it took to watch. <br /> Second, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up looking at this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... Barefoot's executives and his John Carpenter movie. Soldier is essentially an action film, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role, but Kurt researchers up emotionally convincing and very little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, the fighting scene and the battles are well choreographed. This is by making monkeys, or even the uterus, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, and you like sci-fi movie action, select it if you pass your rental deposit in choice. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
