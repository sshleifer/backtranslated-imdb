This in my opinion is one of the best films in the 1970s. It not only features a great cast, but also is packed with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. The story is about a green Vietnam (Kris Kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (John-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Christ begins to take advantage of his position, it gets as bad as it criminal has hired to get rid of. It's great to see Christ play against qualities. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principals both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real movie star characters in this movie. I do not think Vigilante forces are on video but it occasionally shows up on TV. It's a great movie soundtrack for guys who love movies.
