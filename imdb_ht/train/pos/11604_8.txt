In the seemingly endless quest to get well done, well-acting horror movies, it's all-too-scarce to get one that even comes close to hit the mark. Needless to say, I was very surprised to wonder when I stumbled across "burning at the stake" on a US cable network while I was flipping over. The situation is unreasonable. In 1692, Ann Ann Swan (Swift) is the most vocal witness against alleged witches, leveling allegations against anyone who touches the annoyance. Manipulating him for himself is Reverend Parris (Peters) who also serves as the court guide on matters relating to magic and Satanism. Things get complicated when we begin to accuse members of the Goode family of magic. Salem (in 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have strange visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in the seventeenth century shelters trying to put it there with the building. It continues to turn it around while strange phenomena begin to involve it more and more. Soon, it appears that it will be owned by the Spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, more descriptions become rather involved and would give too much attention. Though the film is not action-oriented and it would likely be of great interest for many viewers, the good performances and the seventeenth-century dialogue were used in the movie sounds very compelling. The production values ​​are viable with the exception of some of the special effects. On one side-note, the film's technique was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Viewers who appreciate a well-filmed, atmospheric, but understated movie horror movie can appreciate this. The writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in movies and film cinema films and is best known for his work on a number of "big insects" films and works similar to earlier years.
