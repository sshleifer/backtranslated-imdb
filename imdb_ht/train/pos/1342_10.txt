An enthralling, wonderful look at the movies that inspired the Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easy to relate to his work, especially those earlier, the era is silent. Very enjoyable despite being briefly, I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film again. Required to see if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
