<br /> There are STAR TREK Cannon - lots of it. From our cannon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts and new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE pretty much uneven in ST canon. An unfortunate fact for long fond of fans. As one, I assume that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there - but no. <br /> <br /> The phase phase, as much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. An old style Starfleet Laser Gun, a golden slimmer speckle conveyor effect - that's what I expect to see. Also, I did not expect to hear better sound effects based on bip that looks like TNG, but far apart from Tos sound effects. In the earlier look of TOS (the original pilot: the lake), we see a Starfleet and a more formal military aspect - a bit of old seagull. With ENTERPRISE, we see a traumatic inequality to rank. There are more military codes in the STAR Blazer cartoon than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> It is fine that Captain Archer is over to the needs of the Universe (as well as Kirk who has never been trustworthy in his application of human justice), but inside the ENTERPRISE everyone looks like an equal. Unprofessional, safe, far from the feeling of formal military service than found in any set of ST - and that's a lot! <br /> <br /> Music song for singing theme songs announces their trip to a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE seems to show us a particularly fun, warm-sound exploration of human relationships rather than taking us on a historic, bold, fearless, high-rick explosion of space. <br /> I would choose Adrian Paul to play the Captain with an older person to be the doctor. Still, I loved the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an outstanding ballroom dancer in Boston College, is sure to grow nicely. The characters that make up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE starts to run it stronger than did the last three series STAR TREK. Let's hope for a good future!
