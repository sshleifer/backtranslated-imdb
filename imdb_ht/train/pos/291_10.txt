Zombie Story is not something called on, it's obviously not a winning movie but it's a fun B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who runs blood camps that has been another fun low budget budgets. The act is as bad as cheaper to make films, but that makes it the most fun, the make-up zombie is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and the gross, the movie is sort of like a version Zombies in accounts out of the Crypt since we get two accounts about zombie encounters in the woods, their stories are fun and let you guess especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some zombie budget budgets out there, if you like low budget B-movie or cheap flicking zombies then check out zombie Chronicles.
