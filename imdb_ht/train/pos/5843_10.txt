Lubitsch latest production but not his least interesting film. Somehow largely ignored by critics as he could not finish it himself and as the movie was not co-signed by Preminger which he performed most of the scene ... A very unusual mix of music (a remembrance of the Merry Widow?) and Classic Lubitsch touches Sentimentalism (an unbelievable love story like Cluny Brown) yet a very clever and clever one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia in some worlds lost but rather a testament over eternal feelings which occurs on the frenzy of humanity and especially men of war in the war with a "moral" lesson still today as it was in 1948. Billy Wilder as a premier response to the plagued Lubitsch's funeral about losing a great man read that we are still his movie and how much it all got on that Lady of Ermine ...
