This movie title almost puts me on watching it. Not a fan of Manchester United, the only mention of Beckham was a bit about wearing, however I put my prejudice behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> I did not expect much of a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie played with me never looked at my look and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you love East is East then you will love this movie. OK so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are in the movie but it's all done very showy, with a breath of fresh air. The movie moves very fast and keeps the audition entertained. Aktaisal funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempts at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
