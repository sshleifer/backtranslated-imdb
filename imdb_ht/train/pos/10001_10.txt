Brilliant on-act by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo ladies I have ever seen, and the love scene of clothing store is second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in blazing saddles. Attorneys are also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, sold out his boss, and the lawyer's peptus bolt was indifferent to indifferent "I am a lawyer" he said. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is also fantastic here as a crazy millionaire who wants to break the ghetto. Her character is worse than usual. Scenes of hospitals, and the scenes where the homeless invaded a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the footage of the two shingles (one hemorrhage). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is quite often).
