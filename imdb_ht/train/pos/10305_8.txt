If you want a painful laugh, watch this movie, and Bruce things influence his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I do not know why they did not include in the original movie. It can not be because of time, since the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been neglected for too long. Jim Carrey needs med!
