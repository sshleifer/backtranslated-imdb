One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like watching a train accident in slow motion, but nice nonetheless ... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and they are infinitely quotable: "It's a beautiful day goddamned, now will you just shut down?" Explaining the opening of Little Edie's costume only promises that the movie will live forever, and so will be Big Edie "The World Famous Singer" and Little Edie "The world famous dancer."
