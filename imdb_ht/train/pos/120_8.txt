It does not work every movie to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure on a mass market hit any day. While this really can not be described as a failure, the sum of its part remains ambiguous. That kind of idiocy tantalize me in watching him again and again. This is a challenge, provocative films that do not wrap the items neatly. The problem with the film is in its structure. Its unbearable scheme seems to wind up, as a second end is sneaking over. Even though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long not by that unit. The bigger time of Leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The artificial components are provocative and engaging; A character is pre-projected but his own hands in the foreground is not. The world displays deliberate, traumatic and absurd. Keep your eyes shaved for a memorable, technically astonishing assault that will make your jaw drops. <br /> <br /> The stunning compositions. People who chose to be released (from print) videos in pan panes and scan have never seen it. Where's the DVD? <br /> It is inferior as anyone can give this very originality to a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get sense that Trier bit more than she could chew, but this movie ends up being the richest of it. I suspect he is familiar with the Hitchcock's foreign correspondence in which European unpleasantness also manipulated a American dupe and several Welles films that delight the joy of techniques as much as he does. All Trier movies explore the naughty combat among indisputable societies. After Zentropa, Trier moved away from this kind of bold technique experience towards sad, sub-rated, un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancers in the dark.
