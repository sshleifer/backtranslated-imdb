The industry dropped the ball over it. The trailer does not do justice to the movie and then open it on a full screen. There were people who had an opportunity to see this, oral work would have made it very successful. The main 2 actresses each provide great emotional performance that really draws you to the story and especially the characters. I check this out of based on the recommendations of Richard Roeper's or Raven (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a big movie that has never been completely released except on a few screens. Given that it has no chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they are not good. This is Oscar worthy and is a tragedy on many levels that will never be heard. Maybe through words in the mouth will have something about DVD or cable. If you do not see this movie you should. The great performance of 2 actresses has led to this movie. She could just have been another movie teen film after special school, but instead she just got to another movie worthy to deserve. Interrupted girl comes to mind. If you like that you will love this. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in an amazing emotional scene after another without coming as melodramatic. Though Alicia is angry with Deanna weeping in most of the movie she is doing is such a real way that she does not come as a stereotype or melodramatic character. The film will move you to many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better at this happening in traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that use the talents as well and let them shine. See this movie and if you like, recommend giving friends so it does not get lost among all the blockbuster crap coming from each year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 head records. What kind of words do we live in? AGHhh. So make the world right again to see this and recommend it.
