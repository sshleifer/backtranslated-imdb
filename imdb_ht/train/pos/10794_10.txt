I've always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film. Although the act can not be superb, the fighting scene is fantastic. I also like to see Judson Mills doing alongside him. In my opinion, Brother Norris has proved themselves to be fine amateurs and this was yet another fine production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
