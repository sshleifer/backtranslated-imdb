Zero Day leads you into thinking, even re-thinking why two boys / boys would do what they did - committing suicide by killing their peers. It captures what must be beyond a bizarre fashion for being for those who have decided to withdraw from common civilies in order to define their own / mutual world via mayhem coupled. <br /> It's not a perfect movie but given that money / time filmmakers and actors - it's a remarkable product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of young suicide / bandits it's better than 'Elephant' - in terms of being a movie that gets under 'rationalistic' poems it is a far, far better film than almost anything you are likely to see. <br /> <br /> Defective but honest with a terrible honesty.
