A very high-standard kolumbo story that was actually the first episode filmed in the long-run series but was originally transmitted second (after "Kill by the Book"). Robert Culp makes his debut in three appearances as the murderer invites in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who is the wife's blackmails (Patricia Crowley) of a wealthy, very influential businessman (played very sympathetic by Ray Milland) after he falsifies a report, in his favor, after discovering having an affair. The woman later rebel against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many respects, particularly as the plot is so strongly laid-up and immediately developed and Also because of the rare ingredient kolumbo that the crime is a non-restrictive killing. Additional things to increase when the widower husband uses the assassin to help Columbo in his investigation: a feature that facilitates good quality scenes, particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters are met with the absolute trumpet of Columbo trumpets are beautiful in evidence . <br /> <br /> Led and Flair by Bernard L. Kowalski and acting at a high level, this really puts the tone for whole series (since "Kill by the Book" has left down to an end poor). The script by Columbo creator Richard Levinson and William Link is precise, structured and well-thought-out and is inspected by a steady, productive and sequential sense that really shows the unforeseen in the story. Finally, the punitive punishment that Columbo has always been a step ahead of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very good piece of detective work for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the output team worked positively and constructive to render a polished Columbo story.
