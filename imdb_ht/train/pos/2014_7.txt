Mel Torme and Victor Borge, in the youngest years, serve to make this movie interesting - and especially to watch a teenager Sinatra, on the sunny side of 30, and definitely transmit that this was her "yes, I'm a popular singer, but hardly an actor again "stage. Michele Morgan is an annoying presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me. Leon Errol is funny, as always, but overall very funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is on the "right" class, because with the combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of a lot of stories, and one silly of that, and the warnings first mentioned - it is in general the best average. Most of the passion is from the look of the three entertainment icons in the early years.
