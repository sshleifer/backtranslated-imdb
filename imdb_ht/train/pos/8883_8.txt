The film's drawing seems to be the Alpha and Omega in some of the biggest issues in this country (US). We see the relationships all in the university environment for the movie. Occupation, obviously v.s. the teacher is present. But what the movie adds to its value is its other relationship: male v.s. fi, white vs.s. black, and v. people society. But most important of all and in direct relationships with all other relationships are people v.s. his head. <br /> I was surprised at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to show the race relationships on the campus. Most films usually show injustice in one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film has shown both injustice and suffering both sides. He did not try to show how either was right, although I might say that their skin was shown a lot of kringer and retaliation (clearly towards the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically that injustice in some ways brings two races together, for a while. Lawrence Fishburne performs on-the-top performances as the Prophet Phipps professional. It stumbles the idea of ​​race favourism and instead shows paralysis of lazy and down-trodden with the worker and positive work. The other stars that make this movie are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport provides an excellent portrayal of a fast-moving, angry youth who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks made his first film and proved supremodel to act. <br /> <br /> Higher learning becomes its name in college shows as more than going to class and get a piece of paper. In fact, I would say the movie is almost a satir to show student interaction with each other, rather than some dry books, such as real education at a university. It is a life learning process, not a single textual one. I think you'll find "Higher Learning" is on the major issues of many universities and even life in general. 8/10
