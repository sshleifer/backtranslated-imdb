This adaptation of the movie Pearl S. Buck is certainly a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all of this a great Hollywood movie has: Birth, Death, Joy, Sorrow, Exaltation, Despair, and so on. There is one thing that irks me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he performed an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a firm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. It does not even look Chinese! I think he tried to find the role, but should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Mrs. Rainier was very good at the movie, but they hardly tried to look at her "native". Always read a big movie, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). It's a must see, just look beyond the casting. I think you can.
