Pretty good movie from Preminger; Labyrinth at times, as he explores to lay down with localities from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film about the contemporary of the modern city and how to live. In this regard it is visually and spatially satisfied, as her hero, a good cop and a bad weather, joining very hot water when he accidentally killed a guy with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it was Hamlet, and it was never better. The story may be most melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight, and almost increases it to the tragedy level. As her girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, and its natural heat gives a nice contrast to Cools Andrews'; His smile, ami-looks bad guy seems to be still challenging his nemesis by the only fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the injured and moralist leader who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There is no big surprise in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. For Preminger director is a meeting of his or her Laura star, Andrews and Tierney, who spent the top careers at around the time the movie was made. Throw in support, - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - they understand, more optimistic, as they all got on their way up. Preminger, as reliable as an observer, allows events to unfold without a strong point of view, as the ending moral limit is somewhat disappointing, for the game cat and mouse between the two antagonists looks larger and more archetypal than any movie only could include, much less resolved. <br /> <br />
