Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully achieved. It's not completely loyal to the book, but should it be? No, not at all. John Thaw is fascinating as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff caring was well achieved, making it more credible than Scrooge's Christmas Carol. Following Morse Inspector, this is Thaw's finest help. He was matched stiff by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a very convincing portrayal of a evacuee traumatized by the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and music made it worth the purchase, and you also see Thaw playing the org. Amazing! The most moving scene, Willie found out about Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased family of scarlatina. Buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
