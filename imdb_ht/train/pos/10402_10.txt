I saw first stealing as a kid that made me almost old as Jinn's guess. As any kid would be, I was happy with inventing the imagination, and energy of the movie. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and understanding of the script I missed on that first look. I have never spent an opportunity to look at her throughout the years. In addition to the script, the transcendental genre of fantasy. This is Korda, the storyteller of his very best. When you see thieves like a child you know that you've got a great time. When you see thieves as an adult you know that you've seen a prince. It's as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
