Never seen this movie and enjoyed singing and dancing by Cagney and other members casting: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice with Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musically and eventually goes to producing Prologues that are shown in between the movie features shown in movie theater during the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his show. This is a very entertaining and very comedy movie with many laughs. Joan Blondell, (In Prescott) has given a great support role that was also very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started out with his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
