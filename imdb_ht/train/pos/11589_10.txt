Man, I loved this movie! This really took me back to when I was a kid. These are the days when teachers have always been showing cinema-reel-movie-movie-and-if you're good, they would slow down the film so you can watch it play backwards. I always remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazema is his name, he was an orphan. He lived with his sister and the village." This is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon. At the end of the other Indian boys in the village attached the feathers to Tutazema and he became an eagle himself. He came to live the way he always wanted. He came to earth.
