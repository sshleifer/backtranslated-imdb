This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about it in my opinion was the head of the act of directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but most of his other films are on video if not DVD. That was the case, why not this one? A friend recorded it off of TCM for me, but having it on DVD would be great. For special features they could tell a historian Marine talk about the fight and if Mr. Schmid's wife or their still alive living would be interviewed too. Anyway, this is a great movie and I recommend it. If it ever is out there hopefully it will not be colorized. Colorfully it would be in my opinion just to ruin the entire effect of the movie. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 movie would go. Mr. Garfield has done a superb job to show Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of Mr.Schmid's disability but I feel it was just fair. I sincerely hope to come out with this movie on DVD a day as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines that offer great sacrifice for us in the Second World War.
