The dentist starts in the morning at Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) & her wedding anniversary Brooke (Linda Hoffman). On the surface Mr. & Mrs. Feinstone seems to have a wonderful life, a beautiful home in Los Angeles & it has a successful career and responsibility but under the very bad things. Alan discovered that Brooke had an affair with Matt (Michael Stadvec) cleaner pool, adding to his humiliation Alan then discovered that Matt also had sex with Paula Roberts (Lise Simms) one of his neighbors next door, In her head all of it must be the IRS, which will breathe her neck, a charge flow of money. Alan starts to lose his head and persuades himself that everything is rotten & rotten, just like his patient teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. This morning at work she began to take frustration and anger out on his patients, first to injure a boy named Jody (Brian McLaughlin), and the sexual assault of a named named April Reale (Christa Sauls) It's alusing that he's his wife & deliberately doing a non-necessary and painful procedure on another. Alan also starts taking drugs as she completely loses her & goes homicide starting with her adulterous wife & Pool Cleaner ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Brian Yuzna I thought the Dentist was a good movie & tried Something is a bit different. The script by Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon & Charles Finch is more of a psycho thriller than the right slasher who came as a surprise to me as I expected the letter, it would be easy to make a young slasher movie like Friday 13th (1980 ) with a high body count & a wicked wicked dancer but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different. The dentist is in the heart of a character study of one descent of madness and he does a fine job although he says I am not sure what he goes to justification for his subsequent killings. She moves along in a beautiful rhythm, has a nice narrative in which I liked the constant connection Alan to make between the decay he sees in his patients and the rotten he sees in the world around him & it's a way Fun to spend 90 minutes odd. It goes without saying that anyone with a phobia on the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you will never go again! I like to finish off where the tables turn, I will say no more ... <br /> <br /> Director Yuzna does his usual job fine here, in fact I do not think I saw a movie Yuzna movie I did not enjoy to some extent, it's obviously & advantageous to take the opportunity to play on our nervousness at the dentist and some pretty dainty torture pieces that include pulling the tooth, sexually fitting, doing surgery on drugs & torture people and exercise the dentist's dentist. There are other Gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut outside tongue. Yuzna gives the film a certain style of what was probably a low budget, he likes to inclinate his camera that makes for some nice angles & I liked the shot where the camera is above someone who was knifed & spray great in splatter blood on the floor of a beautiful overhead angle. <br /> <br /> Technically the dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music and production value although some of the special make-up effects look a bit compelling. The act is very strong of all involved with Corbin wearing a good crackpot performance. Still the cool & favorite genre Ken Foree turns as Detective Gibbs one of Los Angeles's finest. The dentist did not turn out like I expected & all the best for her, if you are a horror fan & maybe want something a bit different then this is well worth the currents. I love it & thinks it's definitely worth a look.
