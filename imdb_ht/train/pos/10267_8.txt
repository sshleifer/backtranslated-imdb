Plenty wrote on the "House of Games" Mamet; most of it is good. I decided to review the flick to see how it was born after 17 years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed watching it again. The film's success and resistance probably have a lot to do with two principal ingredients that are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet managed to bring its signature imunite with obvious histrionics in the movie while scamming us, the audience, and the mark together. Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc. all while building the story. "House of Games", now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for the first time and an okay search for Mamet fans. (B +)
