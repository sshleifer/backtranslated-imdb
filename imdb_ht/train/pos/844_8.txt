A chance to encounter between a seller and a change-man changed both of life. This is an odd movie that works, an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard. In a widespread doubleroom role that is a far cry from James Bond, Brosnan is amazingly effective as a seeker who starts to clog under the stress of his work but is able to connect emotionally with anyone helping him face . Kinnear is equally good as the seller, a decent fellow and a cancellation of his life. Davis is quite flirtatious wife Kinnear. Especially a character study, the movie is rewarding because it feels cool and unpredictable, a very dark comedy.
