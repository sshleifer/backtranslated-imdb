Although this movie puts Davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as waitress waitress waitress / whore Mildred Rogers waitress, this film is my unsatisfactory remark as a whole. The act is true in most respects. What I can not understand for my life is just how or why Phillip, a tender, well-trained young man would have the constant abuse of this hump constantly dishes out towards him: I find that naive tolerance well incredible ridicule in certain respects. Yes, I know it's a sensitive club-foot, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a venom witch that nobody is cultivating would tolerate his attitude or actions and make it credible. Davis is surprised in his role: Yes, he can go further in his histrionics now and then, but in a creative painter painting any way you look at it. Too bad he would not play a wrong gangster. Her character has been completely credible as a low-life tramp!
