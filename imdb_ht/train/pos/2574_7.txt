Ten years after the first movie, James Belushi, one of the most gifted, and on seeing comedic actors in the last twenty years, returns as Dolective Doley for this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting more of the same in the first movie, you'll be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. Realizing that all the dogs vs. Man Battle of scenarios additions was probably used up in the first movie, this one turned a little more psychological in his approach as it focuses on a criminal and a starving and recently deceased Dooley's wife she dismissed her book, and blamed Dooley for her death. <br /> <br /> The script can not be the best, but the movie allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good ability to act, while still maintaining enough in the light humor of the First Movie to Make It Work , and chemistry between the two stars to be seen. <br /> An easy, light-going film, which, while perhaps not worth buying, unless you're a true fan of either the first movie or Belushi, definitely worth a look when it comes to television. <br /> <br />
