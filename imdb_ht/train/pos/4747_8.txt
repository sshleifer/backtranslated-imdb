Anyone who has never seen anything like the Battle of the Matrix has never seen this film. The battle scene was choreographed by stage psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also made the fights of the Matrix. And the fighting scene is somethin. He plays a supersoldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as a Pacific librarian (ya got me). When other evil supersoldiers begin to kill from local drug leaders to take over the drug trade, He team up with his buddy friends to help stop them. <br /> There are some absolutely crazy things going to this movie (one badguy gets his arm cut off with an end of glass and hardly notice). Battle scenes are full of flying kicks and punches; The body count is the way to stand there. He has rarely been better, and has surrounded himself with a savvy of beautiful girl costumes (Yip kicks some serious asses like a fellow supersoldier). Anthony Wong even made a comedy as a drug master (there is no supras, he made a comedy in every HK movie). It's unfortunate to do no action movies like this in the U.S.; I should not sit in all these terrible duplication works to see that action I crave very much. Recommended.
