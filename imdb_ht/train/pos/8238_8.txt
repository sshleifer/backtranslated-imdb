I really enjoyed this movie. Acting by the adult actors was great, although I did get the kid the kid a little hard. But she brought herself very well for being a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. Professor of Nutty. If you have a short attention span and are used in the typical Hollywood stuff you probably would not like this as it is a bit slowerly rhythm. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I said the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the best looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extracts were also fresh. They are deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes did not really add anything.
