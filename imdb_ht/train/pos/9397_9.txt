Vaginal remnants of the great west 1940, such as the "Treasury of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" are a story of conscience, greed, and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a down and out, but honest, young man from Texas who goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not in the way he expects. <br /> <br /> The scenario movie has many surprises and draw draws. Excellent cinema, direct editing films, and Moody Western music adds tension and suspense. The expansion of the great sky land provides a wonderful setting. And the chains act in excellent excellence, with great performance from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded land / western song gives the movie a strong final. <br /> <br /> Correctly labeled neo-noir, "Red Rock West" hit me like being something else, as well. The plot is filled with amazing coincidence and incredible distribution, so much so that others can consider the scenario as flawed. Normally, I would agree. In this case, however, when combined with the Moody atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty in normal daily life, the coincidences and easy distribution suggest a story that, beyond "noirish", is ... surreal. It's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with obvious events such as Michael's forces to come up against him. From this point of view, coincidences are not defective script at all. They are required to draw points into a nightmare story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his voice still clearly, that ... a young man, searching for himself, stopped in a small, almost desert city a thousand miles from nowhere. It's her final final on a trip through the twilight area.
