"Purple Rain" has never been a darling critic but it is a classic cult - and worthy to be. If you're a Prince of this is for you. The main draw is Prince sees her abusive parent in her head and she falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is happy. Sometimes it comes funny but when it works it really works. Very striking and missing. <br /> No one can really act in the movie. Everyone is in one of the Prince's acts as the "Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, he adds charm to the movie. When Prince is on his screen, he lights up and is pleased to see him in his commercial peak. <br /> In conclusion, go and see this if you like Prince like me. If you are not a fan of it will make you one.
