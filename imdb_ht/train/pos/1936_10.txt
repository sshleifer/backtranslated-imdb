This independent movie was one of the best films of the high film festival I've ever seen there I liked having lots of things that were great on the movie on top of all that the cast and crew that I had Opportunity to meet was absolutely phenomenal. I thought that Avi had done a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true in his role for a Disney actor I was amazed at his talent to be able to go from young cheesy comedy to an adult role with no talent problems in the movie just the amazing movie was just great if you want to see an independent movie this is one really that you should see. I think Mr Gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission of his festival and his parents loved the movie when he was p The audience's love went and saw him again. This truly was a great movie she was dark and funny and sad and really emotional she was just fabulous. I honestly just so enthused by this movie and I really do not want to spoil it for any one just to see it and really be amazed at it I think these movie makers really have what it takes to go where I hope to see more work in the hands of the future.
