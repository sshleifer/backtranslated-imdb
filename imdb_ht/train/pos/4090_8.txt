This movie is simply incredible! I was hoping something quite different form of the movie I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection to animal behavior. Make me warn those among the readers of this article that are easily offended by content that is all too sexually, for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-frown brush of pornography. It even features a scene that comes very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I strongly suggest seeing this bizarre job of "sexual arts". Every minute in the photo breathe the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way. One should not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go see it! It is worth your money and time!
