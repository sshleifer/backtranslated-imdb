A Chinese student who criticized the nationalist rule, the political arbitrariness of the decision makers around the emperor of Japan's pre-war, was accused of being a 'communist' and prison for life. Her wife husband, who totally supports her husband and her mind, is left alone to save her family from hunger. This film is a great statue built by praising the role of mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she did not get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. She went on a very young girl with limited ability to act. <br /> This feature deeply moves and most 'people' is a must see for all 'true children' of the earth.
