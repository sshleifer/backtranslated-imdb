I watched this on an 8-hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and the altitude) I actually get it mildly fun (emphasis on the "moderate"). The current idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dying, her fianc√©e fell in love with another person, she decided to ensure that they did not get along, but eventually she allowed them to do it. Unfortunately the current movie was not as good. OK, there was a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot was over as predictable as the destination of the flight I was over. I think that a whole gay-but-not-gay part of the story might have been much better. The pale parrot was a nice idea but to be honest: it was not really very funny. The film's resume was more interesting than staring at the front seat, but it was a close call.
