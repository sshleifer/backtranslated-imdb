I sincerely hope that at least the first quarter of Cosby is released on DVD a day. The episode and Hilton's unique genitals, George (played by Roscoe Lee Browne's late), are classic hilarity. It reflects rivalry of sibling classics and love between brothers who have life to take different paths, but both ended up happy. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly recapture the chemistry that they share on the Cosby show for many years and put them in a more polished middle-class role classroom show that they can take as an artist. <br /> <br /> The list of comedy dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad, and Mr. Cosby ... Classic Genius!
