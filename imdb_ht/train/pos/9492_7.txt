This movie was enjoyable but for the wrong reason. Coordination of the sequence of actions is ridiculous and making the film some cool moments of humorous moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene along the end, where Williamson tells Ginty, "Do you make sure you get around boy friends!". I enjoyed this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline to be written on the back of a cloth in four lines with the rest of the adbed libbed. A movie with more than 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the movie, maybe they've got some insight into how the finished product would look. Things in this one movie that will be for it is that it is quite violent, so that triplets with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a worthy movie to see.
