This movie has so much delightful playing personality, I love the finale, when nobody knows what they will do about their lives, but it's really great when you see and realize that the priest is right, it's jute two, so what else is doing here? The film embraces you in a new life, experience, to be able to dream with others and reaching these dreams. Also shows you the life itself, hard as it is. But give you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. Hope this comment works for you. This movie has worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Take care.
