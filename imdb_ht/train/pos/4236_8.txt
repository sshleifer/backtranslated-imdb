Take this film for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is scary, but I love everything Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like the end of the world b / c in this movie. He was not supposed to be a rumor, and not. <br /> <br /> The finish was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
