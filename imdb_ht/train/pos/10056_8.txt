We've watched this in my Women's Health Problems at the point that women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan to try to get a copy of it myself to look. The story is very touchy and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this film was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The teacher of our class means that the movie primarily has an overly educated woman, but this movie was much more than that. It is one of those movies that will forever stick out to my mind and will be a favorite.
