For those of you who have been very relieved to mimic the Rohinton Mistry, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation is. With the exception of a minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's first film is a nearly dead-on recess in the book (down to the last line). For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a major dramatic cinematic drama. Instead it has a strong element of realism in it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe as a Long Travel to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, hinduous version of 'Fiddler on the roof'. Instead of a Jewish / Russian letter, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker of Bombay in 1970 during the Muslim War / Hindi and Pakistan war. He is forced to cope with a number of unexpected issues in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualized boy, a far friend who gets him involved in some money room, and a neighborhood malsen. The finish is not happy, nor is it sad, but this is essentially what realism involves. <br /> This Long Ride is a little fine movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck to get it. Unlike the novel, he received very little release.
