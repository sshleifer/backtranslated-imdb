Well, I enjoyed this movie quite well. It was funny and sad and yes, the guy Andie MacDowell shagged was hot. Interestingly, realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery. I think my mother would love her. I always thought that should be allowed to call it the Sad F ** kers Club though ...
