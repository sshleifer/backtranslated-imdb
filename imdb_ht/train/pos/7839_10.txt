Hanging by critics at the time but loved by the fans, this film has now become a classic. Mixing supposedly 'surreal' footage in John Lennon's house among other places and feet lives in Marc Bolan & T.Rex at their best, this movie is not just a must for everyone who loves Marc Bolan but gives it a insight fascinating in the era .. These were times when Marc was hobnobbing with the love of Ringo Starr in the beatles [directed], and you can even find a short spot from a Reg Dwight [Elton John to give you] bashing ivoryen in an amazing [and never officially published] version of Tutti Frutti and rocking and chemistry version of the Revolution's Children. There are also wonderful scenes featuring Chelita Secunda [said being 'creating glam rock' and using it to glitter etc.], Mickey Finn and even the actor from Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the field when Marc leaves the table eating, sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out the acoustic version of classics like Get it on with the cursor . <br /> <br /> Very, highly recommended! Five stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
