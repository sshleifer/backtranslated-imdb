49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sleep in bed with a 11-year-old Anna fever (Charlotte Burke) has only her design to hold her company. Her health is gradually getting worse as a series of mysterious 'black outs' flu. In each of these episodes she dreamed of a house in a decent garden, and only a sick-invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) resided. When a black, hazardous danger threatens idyllic "deed", Marc's life is in danger. His life is also in danger as to his own state's dream of health. <br /> Critical: Haunt first features first from British Bernard Bernard director. Taken in a fab ("Marianne Dream") by Catherine Storr, she leaves many other 'original' fantasy works in her waking. Whenever a story faced with dreams and nightmares it is difficult to give it the mixture of fab and reality to make it work in film form. The Rose Director successfully captures the fantasy aspects of the world along with a dark looking euphoria. <br /> <br /> Feverishly scored by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely and jumping experts 'jumping out of your chair' moment. Most glutos are very sloppy in this all-important aspect of the audacious audience of not knowing what the next stage will bring. I also like the way it captures suspense and never let it go or sluggishly sluggishly in the next sequence of events. Also, his mastery of putting objects in the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) provided the movie one dimension added it would otherwise seem to miss. Only in Europe you will find places that are menacing looking like those presented here: the solitary house, the gardens, coastal towns, etc. star <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this movie with "Candyman "(1992) a truth 'thinking of the' horror of the horror and the best favor of the cult of horns.
