I admit I only saw about three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, & of Hamlet) one I liked, the other I found (Macbeth), and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to say that this adaptation is every bit as good as playing intense and dramatic. The act is very strong (With a cast that features Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) With the change in time period (looks somewhere between 17 and 1800) play in beautifully as the characters move on and tell the infamous straight line from the script itself that any fan of Shakespeare play will get thrilled. If you are in this popular drama I highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh.
