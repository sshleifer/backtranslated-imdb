Thought in this first movie would be your typical Western film, however, it turned out to be very interesting and keeping me spellbound right at the very end, which turned out pretty amazing. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76, had past experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", '93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at no nothing to ensure that he kept with him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "Portrait of a Lady", '96, managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among gender unknowns who never seemed to let her alone li. Sam Burgade made some very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised at the conclusion. This is a very fun movie and the act was exceptional.
