Although not the best Anime I've ever seen but I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> I never read the comic book and just saw this in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> The animation was OK, I had the sense of the 80's animated in it which is what set it up for me. Why are all hate people beyond me? <br /> <br /> Character development was fine. I love how they brought the transition from Hope Lady to death around. for you who do not like it, obviously did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happened, and used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a lovely adviser to her. Her nude black style was perfect for this kind of movie. <br /> I think everyone here has been bashed this need to take another look at it and reconsider. causing everything people have been bashed this can be said about favorite favorite Vampire Hunter D everyones
