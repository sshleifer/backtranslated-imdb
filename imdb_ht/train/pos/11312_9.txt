Ossession is in very bad condition but is now undergoing a complete restoration of the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The used material is a "positive Master" 2nd generation originally from Visconti's print managed to hide from the fascists. It was checked on the 4K spirit (as 2K RGB data) then treated using DaVinci Revival software restoration software. And the rest is manual work and we do not anticipate completing early spring. Shortly next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also publish on HD DVDs. This film is beautiful and we hope the restoration efforts will be enjoyed by many generations to come.
