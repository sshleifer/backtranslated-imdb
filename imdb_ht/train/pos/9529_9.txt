This is one of the best movies ever made in 2002. Perhaps it is not the best movie, but it looks best, has great acting and it is directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'Americans Messenger '. /> He tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay, but his son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) envy both her father and Michael rose, leading to the death of Michael's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible for Rooney and chooses a Harriet Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him as Frank Nitti's boss (Stanley Tucci). In a way 'Road Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well done that you can not see it. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its movies. All these elements can be surprise and create suspicions although the result is very certain. That Hoechlin is not an annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on a funny movie this is so much better than you would expect and although it has its flaw it is part of the best movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events that you realize you've seen it many times before, but for some reason it also feels cool at the same time. The scene between Hanks adults and children in Hoechlin helps in this area. Watch this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.
