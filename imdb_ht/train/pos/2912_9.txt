We throw around the theme "Superstar" too lightly these days, but one guy really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I've stuck the series this show all. The song selection was perfect - it only contained the songs I actually wanted to hear and cut off and documentary footage during the weaker new songs. I liked that the band was just a five-man on stage in a very minimalist setting. (With this force, you do not need a circus to be entertained). The shots of the people were amazing, too. How many performers can affect their Beatles' original fans (now in the 50's and beyond), get young kids jumping up in their opening lines in "Can not Buy Me Love" and Everyone's Impact? While watching, I also realized that after John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney was immediately turned into a request. Paul not only lost John and George (whichever the final relationship was, it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never really seemed to garner Lennon's recognition of murder received. I agree that Lennon's death was terrible, but only now I realized that Paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath. I was very happy to find love again at Heather. As for those who complain about the audio / video quality, I had no complaints; Both were crystal clear on my range. I think these same people will complain about the quality of DVD when the next format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> I regret not buying a ticket this show when I was lucky. Thanks to this video I could enjoy it. When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his first music. And let's expect another dig will not change this, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
