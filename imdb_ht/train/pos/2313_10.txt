This "come in age" movie deals with the experiences of two girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one decisive summer. <br /> <br /> Led by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in "To Kill a Mockingbird," the movie never hit a fake score. All the act is superb. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon performed a stunning first movie. Watching this beautiful film and superbly directed and edited movie, I felt like I was looking at a window of reality, rather than watching a movie. <br /> I watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the best movies ever to have on being young, being in love, and going to the feelings, challenges, and changes in adolescent youth. Families aged 10 to 15 should watch it together, and use it as a piece of discussion, as it raises a number of issues on sibling rivalry, how to deal with love, parental responsibility, etc.
