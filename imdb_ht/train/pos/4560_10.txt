I was just back from a show in my "Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and raised. <br /> It's the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and based on autobiographical author of "My Left Foot." Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy like the sole member of her good control in her left foot. The doctors have been advised by parents he had been mentally delayed but his mother did not give up on it, and, a bit as Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned alphabet and then read, write, and paint. <br /> This movie won the Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) as well as best actress support for the actress playing her mother; He also received Oscar nomination for best photos, best directors, and best suited scenario. As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many films can entertain me, many also often leave me neglecting gross fiction or inability to achieve realistic psychological reactions. <br /> By this film - it was absolutely "spot on" to show the role of parent and behavioral role (see, for example, see the typical Irish family of McGoldrick in "Ethnicity & Family Therapy"), as well as unmatched Christy's maturation Brown's - some personality reactions imitate being even amplified in his father's picking characteristics. The movie presents the greatest truth while changing certain sequences in his development (painting and writing) and condensing several important people into one person, for the sake of telling a coherent, credible, No burden, distraction, actually important. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) Our DVD version has shown there were some English translations that have been a great help in understanding Christy's speech (and some of the Irish speech); First release this movie may be missing. (If you see this on DVD, allow this option.) Performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest credible believers jobs I have ever seen. Surely beautiful, exceptional, superlative <br /> <br /> "My left foot" brings more than some similarities to a more recent movie, the "Bell Diving & Butterfly", in which every life show in a Real people successfully exceed the prison and isolation of a very serious physical disability. <br /> And in doing so, he resonated with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" which begins: "Out of the night covering me, // Black as the hole from pole pillars, // I thank God whatever god can // For my unbelievable soul. "
