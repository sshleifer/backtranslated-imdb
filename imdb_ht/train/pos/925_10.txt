A word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I've seen anything like this in a long time on network or cable TVs. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air at full-time TV shots and showing reality and boring re-run. <br /> I must say I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in bad cries and reduced the show. But when half an hour was over (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running a commercial-free show), I left with the feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the true love that someone feels in his bowel. Everything about this show is screamed excellence. <br /> <br /> Graphics in this show was at least as good as finding Nemo and Shrek. No little feat to consider what movies have taken years to develop. <br /> Wearing was wonderful. I'm part of John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team certainly was on par with John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow's guest appearance. It was on top of the game created neurotic, pudgy, and lovable panda and a Jewish track of it. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show.) The script was funny, with a lot of inside and adult jokes that were sharp, but no little. A note to all parents: this is NOT for children. This show has never been released as such, and there is a reason to put it for 9pm, by 8pm. So if you would like to complain about "obnoxious context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and Papa's pride is it. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a bit embarrassed by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I feel "stereotyped" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yes, they speak German accents. But it's news yesterday. Give us something new, something cool, something funny. Put the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "power star" that these guys have. That's fine by me. But please do not stay on something that everyone already knows by heart. Hopefully, the rest of the show will not play the same old record on and off. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show is definitely a Must-See-TV. Funny, witty, and a few unexpected twists here and there - there was not a comedy this good since Seinfeld. I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode.
