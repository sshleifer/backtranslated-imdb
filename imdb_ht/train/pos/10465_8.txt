Even so early in his career, Capra was well accomplished with his camera-work and his distribution. This is a thinner story - and quite predictable at times - but it gets pretty good performance from his disposal and has some rather complicated camera motion that involves the viewer lying. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though anyone with brain can see that the bottom will fall out of that - rich 'chefs' losing his treasure. However, because of its proper disposal and fast pace, it is easy to get caught in the swarms. Then the movie becomes more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. The last is very predictable, but satisfied. I also congratulate title-writing: very witty and fun.
