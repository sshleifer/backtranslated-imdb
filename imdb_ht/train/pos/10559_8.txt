I have not written a review of IMDb for the longest time, however, I felt myself forced to write this! When looking for this movie, I found a particular review that asked the PA to see this movie. Do not pay any attention to this ignorant person! NO is a fantastic movie, full of laughs and above all ... imagination! Are you not sick and tired of being strengthened to feed even the old sugar in garbage-gum films? Sometimes a movie like NO comes along and gives you something you never saw before. I do not even care if you are the flu (even hate) movie, but no one can discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputation and no negative reviews should discredit the movie as such. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people that they should not look at it. We have the spirit of our own and will make your own self thanks. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is any good, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind a bit of eye-candy! Look NO!
