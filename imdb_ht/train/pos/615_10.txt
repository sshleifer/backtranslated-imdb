This is the epitome of fairy tales! The villains are completely cruel and the heroes are refreshingly good. Danish, Deniro, and Pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performance, magic delightful, funny and dramatic, with a perfect finish finish making this movie absolutely fabulous! I'm not so all content appropriate for younger children but for an older audience, there are so many hilarious subtleties! The reviews do not do justice to this movie! My fate and I was quite uncertain but were so happy we took a chance on this movie that I can only hope to ensure anyone on the fence on this movie gives it a try!
