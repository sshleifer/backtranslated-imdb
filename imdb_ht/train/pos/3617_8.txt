"Girlfight" follows a project that remains New York high school girl from a sense of worthlessness in the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem, goals, and more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the movie. So much so you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artfully a good shooting and a sense of honesty and reality, "Girlfight" is no flicker chick and no "Rocky". It is, rather, a very human drama that even viewers who do not know boxing will be able to connect with.
