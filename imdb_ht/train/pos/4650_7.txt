As an employee of the Swedish Air Force I enjoyed the beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) painted black and the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. True jammer war definitely does not look like that, at least not what I saw. <br /> But apart from that, it's a fun movie with a very fun end (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing diverse Swedish military units, including the current-legendary SSG, should film this one.
