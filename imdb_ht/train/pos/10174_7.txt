This was another World War II giving soldiers and allies to be careful about spreading rumors. These are called "instruction" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking character character called "Pvt Snafu." All of us have imagination, with fear and what you are, and that's what's happening here as Pvt. Snafu sometimes adds two and one of the things it hears and comes with "five." You can start panic with all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people to believe them. This includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. It's still doing today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war," declaring a great baloney near the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans still have not learned. This cartoon may have 65 years old but it sure matters today. As I wrote, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think "War on Terror" is just an exceptional file slogan. Amazing. The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses analogy to "hot air balloon juice" here featuring the message above. With Theodore Geisel (her real name) you know the rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> There is nothing hilarious here but it was not meant to be. You have to understand the climate in 1943 and the justified paranoia that came out during the Second World War. Those who forget that war could easily hurt up and win. It was a turbulent time
