I love it because of my last personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is over. The characters of the farm did not really enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoyed themselves, that was what they were. The movie has done a great job making this simple day a simple memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely on the deeper discussions about the values ​​of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussions about the definitions of life or love or relationships or current issues of life or some sort of such. Before Sunrise has dealt with it in a beautiful way, allowing the viewer to pause and think and adjust his breath and go on watching the movie. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thinking of yourself. It just encourages you to think about some issues in everyday life and has given you some alternative options. This was the conversation between the interesting characters, not just typical shining complaints or flowing ideas. You would always think about these issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You can have something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie with a value of time to watch it. I am on a trip too. The movie somehow represents some parts of me and answers some of my questions.
