A very strong movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. As I think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from Bruce's remembrance list. <br /> <br /> This means the woman was a real assurance and she did her job. <br /> Well, Novikov property seems to me to work in this movie. However, I believe in Return to Future Theories of World Multiplicity '. So, Bruce was able to save the world, but not his world. <br /> In the theory of parallel world man can meet himself. <br /> And I believe there is no problem at that. But I do not agree with Dr. Brown from Returning ... But the PF 12 monkey story has its own beauty. Inspired by all these theory in one world or many or only one can believe it is really crazy with the doctor - his girlfriend has just lost .. A sequence of events that can lead him to believe he is from the future. The bullet - well it might have some errors, some fake. <br /> Well I like this movie - bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
