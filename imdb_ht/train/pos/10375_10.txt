A country-boy Aussie-Rule Player (Mat) goes to the city night before an all-important AFL trial, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. Then things go wrong. <br /> There are no-hop cousins ​​have become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer Tiny (which looks like any gangster anywhere, but is definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat gets enmeshed into the chaos, and it is not long before thinking of matching the shunted tomorrow to back himself as frantic event in the night to unravel. The Western Australian professional achievement Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as a young naive nation-boy mat, and successfully plays a part well under his age. Best support from Jan Batchelor as small, with a fun role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops after the events. Roll is fast-paced, often funny, with a very refreshing use of an hour.
