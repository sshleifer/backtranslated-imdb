Excellent show. Instead of looking at the old type of old sitcom show where it's the same old, just different "star", this refreshing show provides an incredibly fun view of office situations. We went to watch any TV for 2 years and after coming back, all of the available shows we looked forward to watching this show on W. Wont on Global for pulling the plug on this one. I thought that this one would be a winner. Let's be realistic about these things, some Canadian SHOWS do it. Everyone I talk and enjoy this show and I believe it was crazy about the globally. I guess they want to stick it out with the typical fury ideas from the United States instead of pulling behind a Canadian show that has a lot of promises. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of TV, but, come on people, let's keep the variety. This unique show provides a very funny look at a slightly exaggerated side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that you do not see on any site today or in the past. Too that world said no of this one, crazy mistake.
