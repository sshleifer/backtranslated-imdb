I found this to be a very fun dark comedy. Brosnan is genius; As anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the role of bail. Kinnear was as charismatic and funny as anyone could in the role. I do not know if I was laughing like hard during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line I would 'feel like a hooker bangkok about a Sunday after the city's sailboat left. Brosnan has delivered this highly-bonded line with these unusual trading instincts. I was also very impressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems like everyone in this movie is wired from previous work to such a degree that it actually improves the comedy. If you liked black and hilarious 'The Weather Man,' you will definitely love this. I voted 10.
