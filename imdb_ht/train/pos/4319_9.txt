On the second look of this movie, I love it even more than the first time. It's full of nuances and a perception of life as they were quite ordinary and often scary, but this movie lifts at a height rarely realized is to focus on the little incidents in our lives normally we only offer the briefing of attention attention. Here the movie turns into the celebration of such incidents, the meeting of a tow truck driver and client, the jogger heard a baby's cry from the bush. Dialogue, act, casting and superb directions. No two by four, there is no grand revelation. What I observed was how true the characters were in the basic nature and how to improve their lives came when they were celebrated. Kudos at all involved, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
