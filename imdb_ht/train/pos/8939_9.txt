A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and breaking the Broadway play on the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters who lived past the age of 100. Most played in the old age Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively, tell stories in the Amy Hill hostel floats (played by Amy Madigan), a New York Times white reporter. Flatbacks and attendance-day scenes are not invaluable in their inspiration as in the book, but really are powerful. However, certain aspects of their sister's life, such as the inter-racial background of mothers and the reasons behind their personal belongings are clearly not present. You need to read the book completely to understand things. Which is just as good, because the book just as great! Aside from these flaws, it's nice to do and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, with a very powerful movie and education.
