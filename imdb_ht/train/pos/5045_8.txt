The film is very complementary to what it is, keeping one continuously interested in the flashbacks of childhood and growing up with such a rare father, and interpreting it with the murderous series, one simply can not go wrong. The very draw in itself, the very story and essence of the movie is fun. It's sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do a lot and, in this case, he really did so much with it. <br /> From the beginning to end you are caught anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the movie is going, and the creativity behind this story is first-class. I felt as though this film was exclusively done from the beginning to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring frog - the action flowing neatly, quickly, and well tight from one scene to the next. <br /> It shows just how far people can go: to do horrible things to their loved ones, and to perform the acts of evil in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case a. It is also sometimes interesting to its' twists and take on the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the movie sort that one easy to donate, but I would recommend you do the same and to check this movie out - it's great for worth your time.
