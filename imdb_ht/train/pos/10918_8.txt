Five deadly venom is the easiest K.F. Flick from Shaw Brothers' Stable (excited perhaps master killer). It has been the artist who has become known as simply the "Venoms", some of the best choreography choreography ever, and, surprisingly for a movie kung fu, a great plot! One of my all-time favorites !!!
