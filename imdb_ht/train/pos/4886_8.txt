The last of the blond bombs is a bit entertaining of fluffing. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newlywed woman at the loose end. She spent most of her life being the compulsive wife and mother, but she never really was happy. Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth has her regular lunch time with her stick-mate-stricken kid when she stays a street scene. This memorable sparks when he was a member of a band swinging girls in London during the Second World War. We soon learn that the band was not exactly all girls as the drummer was a man dressed like a Woman Some are as hot. Elizabeth pulls out her sax (which she secretly practices at her entire wedding) and joins guitar-playing street guys. Elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist, and the money starts to shed in. It does not take any money as it is rich and does not need it. Playing it is just for artistic progress. Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm) who was drummer-in-the-swarm of the band. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - well man, and Elizabeth - were only fifteen at the time - were members of only groups that did not experience "talent" patrick other than drumming. Elizabeth is inspired by her daughter to find the old group together once again to play for dance at her daughter's school. So start a delightful trip down memory lounge combined with aspects of a comic tour trip - all topped off with some really good and blues swings. <br /> I think I'm at the age in which I really enjoy the greatest actress doing things, and this movie is a treasure trove as it's not just star Judi Dench, but she's supported by no less than Olympics Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and an army of commenced British actresses. This is all topped by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Wine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is fluffy, but totally delightful and very interesting fluffy.
