{Possible developer coming ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of ever musical and musical films! (The other is Ladies Yankees and Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes it's the glamor (not to mention the songs) in a lost show of its transition from screen to screen. This is, for the most part, DEFINITELY can not be here. <br /> <br /> These divine, bright and colorful sets, the characters are bigger than life and you can not help but their love, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​happy to know the original Broadway choreographer used) <br /> All of the actors "bouncing the ball" (that is, there is unbeatable chemistry) of perfection in this movie. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating floating game in New York, and the most notorious winner who bets on the same minute - as fever will be up to 104 if it does not take penicillin. Sweet, fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true, her pipe tap is not as exceptional as that of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the doll's mission with a heart of gold and a drive cleanse everyone. And last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, reproducing her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - the hot lead singer singer and dancer who would like to finally finish her 14-year commitment to Nathan and Wedding, and to get rid of the psychosomatic cold he gave it. <br /> <br /> The first, Kudos Stubby Kaye and BS Chicken as they dared Broadway's role as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were no more beloved winners than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb, as usual, and even if it has not received the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - as it has the sense of determination to carry everything it can in the role read as Sky Masterson. "Luck Make A Lady" gives me thrills every time I see her doing so much. Especially enjoyable is to hear her say "Daddy ... I got cider in my ear." Simmons are good and beautiful in a well-suited role, voice and style. You have long been so dear to it not only to win Sky (or, toward the end, believe it), but to help people overcome gambling, drinking and other sins, and living a life of God. It pronounces "If I Was A Bell" is splendid, say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings part that Sam Levene from Broadway's cast could never (terrific actor, but the chap was deaf ... go face). I really liked the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... wish some guy would like to sing like this ME. Frankie's cool, slick attitude beyond the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly, you want her to be married to Adelaide. <br /> Then speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just performance performance in this role. From the accent she belted out "Adelaide's Lament", it's just terrific. And it's also my favorite part of the entire movie. It really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when it's crying right before and then again during my "Sue". I still do not decide if I love "My Pet Poppa" better than "Bushel with a peck" ... maybe I like them equally. Either way, it does fantastic with these as well as "Take Back Your Drawing." (I'm sadly left to "hollanderize" in the movie ...) It's absolutely magic, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the entire movie. <br /> One of the best things about this movie is the lingo. It is a mixture of high class and slang streets. Never use "It", "I'll" or "This." It's still "It is", "I'm going" and "That is." In general, guy & doll is one of my favorite movies ever and musical, and it's one that you should take time to watch whenever it comes on. My only complaint? No "married man today." Now is a good song.
