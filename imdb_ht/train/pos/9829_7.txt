This movie is awesome on many levels ... and none of them is the level that he intends to be scared about. Just remember this: When watching Shaun the dead and other latest zombie films ... let's be good or bad ... This is the formula that they're using. This is what makes cinemas so great. <br /> <br /> And what makes it better than big is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not linger. There's never a point where you think of yourself "c'mon, get on with it" ... it moves quick and nicely. This is the sporty, little Italian number of zombie cops. <br /> So terrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a sufficient amount of time in your blow ... rent it, buy it, love it. As a great trivia note: If you're watching it on DVD, you'll notice having sound effects across the menu screen, under the music note ... Well ... this is because music is up right from the trailer ... that is probably printed and working exclusively in which music that still exists is long enough loop.
