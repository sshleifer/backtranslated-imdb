The most satisfying element on "Real Life Teeth" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is very realistic. Distribution of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's interest was a superb decision; It is exceptionally talented, clever, naturally attractive, and thank God, accordingly to the party's age! This film was made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would be a disaster. Another wonderful aspect of "Real Life Teeth" is that it is a perfect movie for adults interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three poles in the form of "frat pack": dumb dog, gentleman chauvinistic, and joke sleazy. "Teeth in real life" is witty and has fun, smart laugh at all. While other comedies are incorporated or almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience at street, the jokes come from the "real life teeth" are more natural and smart, and involves some thoughts on the part of the audience. /> My only problem with "Real Life Teeth" is that rebellious, the middle daughter played too heightened by actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say if this was a personal choice on his part or a choice by the director. Either way, his character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is only a minor flaw in the movie, and not to take away the story as a whole. <br /> In all, the "Real Life Teeth" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedy. The quality of writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
