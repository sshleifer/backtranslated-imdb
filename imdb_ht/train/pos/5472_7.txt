Barbara Stanwyck as a cookie cookie, a waitress in the working class (and whore from her father) who saved New York City and uses her feminine heres to get a complete job, moving on Mortgage and Escrow, and later as Assistant Secretary in the second in order of the bank. Dramatic study of an unafraid female character must unseemly lose any of her powers over the years, and Barbara acts on a storm (posting a woman who learns to be a first-rate actress herself). Parlaying a little Nietzschean philosophy in her life messed up, this lady broke out all the right feelings, but she never lost our passion, our trembling. It's a plain-talk, hard-boiling big, but not a bitch, nor is it a man-eater or woman-hater. This gall is all out for itself, and as we wait for it to eventually learn about real value in life, travel it up and down the ladder to success to warm up, sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and many eyes make-up) does well in an early role as the assistant in the record office, though all players support them well. *** from ****
