Good Earth is a great movie Everybody must see ... It's tear-soaked and heavily aroused. It welcomes the value-training enhancement of perseverance, humility and love of family ... The story may be relevant to our lives today that poverty is at the threshold. Ways on how we respond to these issues is very important and if someone is not strong enough to face those, it can leave defenseless and useless. I am very happy about how the characters justify the role of the same young actors ... The emotions captured the audience. The film has been made of black and white, but the story is so fascinating that you do not want to finish. Which makes it really great! There should be a re-make for this very beautiful movie.
