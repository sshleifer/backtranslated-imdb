The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual chases when Jerry plunges into an invisible ink bottle and discovers that he makes it disappear. Instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse to change room or something, it uses unseen new-to find it in torment Tom. And it's very funny and well invented despite being a bit of a single-joke drawing. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the very lowest of the lowest T & J overalls. Still worth a 7/10. <br /> However, I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can throw a shadow on the wall, it's challenging physics and the nature of so much to be invisible.
