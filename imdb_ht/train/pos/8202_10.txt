This was without a doubt the best in Harry's room. From the opening credits, you're sweeping up in a tough-hit story and is very deeply engraved. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a woman traumatizing out for revenge. Eastwood has many "sideways" sequences that have nothing to do with the draw, but Harry's show is bad and well spent. Charged with unforgettable characters in the role of miners, rock this film and should serve as the standard for detective / action flicks. This is one Harry's headroom that is raw and is definitely in any "fluffy". I can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a "revenge" wire recognition. The quick speed and several of the unforgettable scenes. "Go ahead - Make my day ... You feel lucky, Punk?" Classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with his cheesy expression, rubber, and whispery, ominous voice can do it.
