Let's put one thing right: this movie does not seek to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It is a flick of comic films, with three great female driving (can not recall any other comedy and similar features), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and Indie Queen Parker Posey, as good as ever. The story is basic: three gallens were "losers" in college, and still after his ward. Poehler is a dog trainer (who does not even get a date with a blind guy), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "was not touched by someone since Clinton was in office" ... I catch that several minutes later ... I'm a little slow, OK!), and Dracht has a gay fianc√© (Seether Meyers from SNL, funny). The senator's daughter "uncool" (still lovely Amber Tamblyn on the television series "Joan of Arcadia") should be harassed during the spring. So, of course have to go to look at it, and some hilarity occurs. All in all, a light, simple comedy, sprinting, and quite enjoyable
