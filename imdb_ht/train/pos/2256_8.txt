It was nice to see her act as "PO POIN" in "Kickboxer and Damme's other movie .. Now she is on her own. She and his wife do a great team .. In this one Qissi is the director of action and lead bad guys and he did a great job, the story made sense, the fight scene had a good job, he did a good job edited properly, driving were real fighters and watch Well together - the story has come together well, and if you can beleive it ... no bad language, no sex, just action ..
