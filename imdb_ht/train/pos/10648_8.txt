What can I say that was not told about the "haunt"? It has everything that would make a great picture. Wonderful, mental music, and sound design to die for all was in place. Simply, though, sometimes boggles the idea in a weird, surrealistic way. The entire team must forget it, perhaps because of being too busy creating cg effects and building gothic lay down in notice how weak the scheme was. Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little material conviction at hand. Lili Taylor has more to do while others are mostly reacting to it. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was a little enjoyable two hours, but you'll definitely want more. A lot more.
