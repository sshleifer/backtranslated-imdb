"So I'm" as above for the lowest .. very special points where wine and people meet. I adore this movie! A gem. Yes amazing thanks! <br /> I was so deeply moved by its very humane quality. I laughed and cried in a whole registry, indeed several octaves of emotion. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist of BRILLIANT as Daniel, a first-rate passionate enthusiast, charisma and powerful. His interior with outstanding talent shines through each scene, each interaction, at every meeting. I was totally mesmerizing, enchanted and keeping the story, which is our collective history, the story of life itself. The film was also so inclusive of many archetypes, Messi, wounded children, magic kids, artists, teachers, priests, abusers, abuses, victims, intimidation, wine drugs - ALL characters for real and true life - all got big romantic and compassion of me. <br /> It's a real treat to see such a thought provoke yet quite enjoyable, entertaining movie. Oh ..mustn't forget the chorus in the sky of angels and sounds nice feel. <br /> <br /> Thank you - This Swedish film will surely captivate people all over the world. BRILLIANT!
