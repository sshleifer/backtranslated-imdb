My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammered since the movie first came out. We have more memorized lines. I watched her two weeks ago and always get tickled into the simple and life-saving lives of Dudley Moore portraits. Liza Minelli has done a nice job as a kick in side - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fianc√© home. His conversation with the butler's chef and Susan's father is spitting. The line from the Butler, "Should You Wait In The Library" followed by Arthur's reply, "Yes I would, the toilet is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny thing "!
