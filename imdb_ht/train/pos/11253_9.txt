This is a very long film, which means you can become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length gives the opportunity for its character to find permanent attachment to your liking. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the sin of the waste you will find it particularly heart-wrenching, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak. If you like a monster you will be crying for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country, his friends and family - a man who has also manipulated and molded since childhood by the same ones. <br /> <There is not one truly favorable character in the whole story, not one loyal, moral personality 'sympathized with them. But watching everything without the help of a tissue should be quite remarkable. <br /> I really enjoyed it in the end. Well worth it for those who love inciteful movies about human character Baser.
