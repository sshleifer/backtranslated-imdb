The most notorious Depardieu movie is this (1974) warring from Bertrand Blier. It presents many very scenic verging scenes on an X-Rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau's making a 1970s warm version of its Jules and Jim handling a trois and two main hippies in French (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film; Everything is fair game .. <br /> It's very odd American tends to not like this movie so many French people I met considering it a classic. Something about it goes against what Americans have scheduled to 'like.' <br /> <br /> Gerard and Deware's late Patrick are two bitch-slipping, hippie drifters and many sexual insecrets, going to pregnant women and committing petty crime. They are out for kick-offs and anti-capitalism, Euro-commie, freedom 'slacker'. Blier satirizes the hell from these two men while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look even more ridiculous. Best of all, is the wonderful way Stephane Grappelli notes the restless souls of the drifters, the deepest consciousness or the 'higher ideal' that motivates all folie to engage in.
