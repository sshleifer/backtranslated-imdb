If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom's Millers Crossing or Keaton in Susie I often recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this movie provide really great performance. If you've had eleven bucks (which is close to nine quid) I say ordering it online, or rent it from your favorite movie rental location. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you're virtually like Gangster type movies. Angry dog ​​/ trigger cheer is one of those movies you have never forgotten, and find yourself watching over and over. You will talk about it so many friends you will be asked to borrow it.
