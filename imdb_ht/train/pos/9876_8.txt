Featuring Lily Mars is a beautiful little movie that presents the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland, along with his standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars tagging together after producer John Thornway for his great break. I think that the comedy is light and there is nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
