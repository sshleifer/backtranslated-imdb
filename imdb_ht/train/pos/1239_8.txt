I think the movie was very good, it will add it to my "collection hunt" after all this time. I believe I've seen other posters that remind some of the most humorous people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points challenged "logic" but a great deal of religious acceptance "on faith" failed to pass the smell test. If you're going to accept whatever your faith subscription you can certainly accept a movie. Was it just me or had anyone else noticed the Aja-Yee Dolye even owned Cranston's Lamontic knife had a lot of trouble taking control of in the "shadow". Not to mention it in the trivia section for either movie here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar in a donut it's the same prop.
