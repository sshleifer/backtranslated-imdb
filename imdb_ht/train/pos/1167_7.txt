Alain Delon visits quick, certain revenge on the bloody crimes family who worked him as a knock-in man in the rebellion of Duccio Tessari "Big Gun" after accidentally killing his wife and children. Tessari and scenarios Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore in "One Minute for Prayer, A Second to Die," and Franco Verucci in the "Ring of Death" take this shareholders on a career weapon for the crowd right down to the wire. Indeed, "Big Gun" is rather predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment and many wild and often kill killings. Alain Delon of the "Godson" is inaccessible to laconic as it methodically deals out the death of the heads of the crowds who refused to let him retire so he could enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte of the "Godfather" plays a Christian Sicilian boss who wants to bury the peel with the Delon character, but the rest of his hard-renowned associates want to die-the dead. Like most criminal crimes in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Weapons" tackled the cynical morality that crimes do not pay. Interestingly, one who has nothing to do with the assassination of the wife and son of the hero survives during another hero's betrayal and extreme prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second of this shoot'em 90 minutes. Apart from the mother and son die in a car bomb mean for the father, the worst thing that takes place came to an automotive wild yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a car tunked. Initially, "Big Guns" is a rather bloody outing, but it has a high body count for a mobster 1973 melodrama. Only at the last minute our protagonist leaves her guard down and thus the morality is comparable to an eye to stay intact. Tessari interns a couple of decent car rides and deaths from a donation to a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent become. Photography and composition are excellent.
