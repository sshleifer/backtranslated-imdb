Indeed: use drugs, shoot -'em-ups, 'Matrix'-esque bullet scams, a futuristic city and a mixture of Asian races, and a solitary vampire - all in the same movie - seems like a story that could Only to be envisioned by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what 'Children's Moon' is, and much more. While all of these components combine can sound like the perfect theme for a B-movie campaign of the week, 'Moon Child' pulls it off with a few hands up riding and strain along the way. There is a fearless, definitely independent feeling, jumping from one stage to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses to their character's life and barely scratching in a true plot. But the film does not make any excuses, rather turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal of all-sided-coated elements of the aforementioned elements of a futuristic, gangster, and vampire society. <br /> <br /> HYDE as the nasty vampire Kei is excellent, giving the character's depth and swing-out acting tro-zeleuz in Gackt as 'Sho,' an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines like the 'vengeful' son who gets friends with a Sho grow-up. The story revolves around these characters and extended friends and family in different periods of life, and how simple friendship can be so easy to get back to grief and betrayal. <br /> While the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just show-off, one thing the movie never does is supposed to be about the many popular Asian musicians it features. The superstars as actors have their flaws, and thus make their characters. The film rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping over quite a bit. 'Moon Child' is rather enjoyable, funny at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!
