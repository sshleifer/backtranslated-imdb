I watched out of this as a kid but while I bought the Blue Underground immediately after being a limited edition, only now I was fit to schedule my look - and that's mostly because Bakshi American POP (1981) just got up on late-night Italian television (see my review in that movie below)! In any way, I found the movie to be a very good sword-and-sorry animated season with especially impressive looking-looking (the rotoscoped rather awkward characters, admittedly, less so) and a rousing if derivative notes. The plot, again, was not exactly original but proved indefinable to engage in a juvenile level with the leading characters quite well developed - especially interesting is the fighter-war Nekron and the Darkwolf Enigma Warriors; The hero and heroine, however, are rather bland irritable - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta describe the girl as well-endowed (her bra could tear off any second) and half naked boots (her small kittens forever disappear up his ass)! Still, it's clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front (involving Darkwolf being particularly wild); The final showdown, though short, is also nicely occupied and sees our hero astride pterodactyls attacking the angels bandits inside a cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, apart from the front mention Frazetta backdrops, the main appeal of this movie for me now is her nostalgic factor as it transported me back to my boyhood day watching not only films such as CONAN BARBARIAN (1982) and the BEASTMASTER (1982) but also hosted television series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and Li-MAN and MASTERS at the university (1983-85). As to accompany the DO in "Fire and ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> Vintage featurette on the movie-and-sorsell movie film which is only available through the VHS printing wash-out owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! He goes through some details about the rotoskope technique and also shows several cases of live-action performance (in a studio) in the segments from the script - which would then be traced, blended with the origins and films -li. Still, having looked like several behind-the-scenes featured on the art of animation (on the Disney Tins and Looney Tunes lying, for example), it does not make for a very compelling piece.
