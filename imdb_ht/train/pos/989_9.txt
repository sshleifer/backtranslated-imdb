Both my friends and I thought this movie was well done. We expect a clever light comedy, but there was a full movie action film blown with comic violence. We both thought that this film could not have done so well in the box office as the forecasts brought us to believe it was a comedy. I was impressed with the support actors and of course Dave Morse always put in a terrific act act. Most of the support bars are veterans not the first time and they were solid. We both felt that the writing and direction were the first percentage and commenting on each other on buying this movie. If you do not buy it for a good time.
