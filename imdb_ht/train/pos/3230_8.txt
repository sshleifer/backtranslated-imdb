OK, so Soldier is not deep and meaningful like runner blade or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable. The fact that Kurt Russell lived in character was not talkative and practically emotionally did the times when his humanity broke through all the more intensive. I found his painting in the development of emotional restrictions more touched than Arnie in the T film (and before I get comment yes I know Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was the but the quote put forward by both film was the same. ) <Brr /> <br /> So the movie itself, a reasonable US / Brit cast can be meat out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and the two deputies were cruel or gifty, so could decide if I liked them or not. The Colony was a little more realistic neither a bunch of love / gullible / loose fugitives that get wiped from going to go nor a group of cybercites aggressive paranoid terrorists on offworlders with each other. <br /> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from LA - the suites like chicks!). Sean Pertwee was really making Daddy proud to be proud of having continued his family's Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped to get meat out of this pathetic path of people who make the most of a bad situation and do not do too seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this on TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I do not think you'll be disappointed.
