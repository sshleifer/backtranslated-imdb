The story of peace-loving farmer and townspeople fought for land, water, law, and order, with respect to the ultimate trial of the long-term interests of hiring weapons worked on the best of earlier (Shane) and probably later movie as well. There are some good action scenes and the overall layout of the story, except a disappointing finish, is well executed. Laws and orders and religions have established roots in the city, but the old order of animals drives, cowboys, and gunslingers is always around as well. The conflict of the two came to a nicely staged scene scene where the siege rises right into a trap. Granger, an ex-gunfighter, plays the guy who is shunned by the very townsman who needs his expertise with a gun.
