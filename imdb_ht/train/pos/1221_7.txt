For the longest time, I loved this movie much better than the original Oriental Care movie. Well last summer, I watched them both together and decided I was wrong. The first is a Best Care Bears Career (as you can guess if you read my review for it). This one is not a movie movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. <br /> <br /> Well first of all, as a few people have mentioned, it completely disguises any knowledge of the movie first. I can not think of another end that contradicts the original so blatant (especially with the sexes of some characters and how they all met). When I was little and watching this, I was quite a bit confused and confused. I felt like looking at it as an adult! <br /> For the reason the movie is actually very good (if you disassociate it from the movie first). I can not think of another movie for small children and a demon as it is villain! Now I am not for a minute suggesting that evil spirits stole the souls of cameras and bears Care are good, I just get it cool that there is a superb evil being in a baby movie! It's like that bizzare "Santa Clause vs Satan" movie in Mexico you hear about sometimes. <br /> <br /> Whatever, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Bears in return for his special power. Very dark for an eh ticker? And I've mentioned that Darkheart looks at the girl more often as a 10-year-old WHINEY VOICED BOY ??? Freak! Meanwhile, there are other kids in Care-A-Lot looking after BABY CARE BEARS! Oh, man! Demons and Baby Care Bears in the same PHOTO !!!! <br /> <br /> Obviously, everything gets cleared up to the end (but not before we get to see the Darkheart Soul's Soul Trap Soul in this awesome chandler thing in a [surprisingly disturbing] disturbing scene disturbing) . But I left with the question of wether this movie was to find the cult hearing it so deserved. I might just look it again myself.
