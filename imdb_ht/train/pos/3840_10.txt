Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this film. I saw this film 6 times and I'm still not tired of it. This movie resembles Flesh Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote the entire Dutch film Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls. My mom does not like him very much but I do not agree. I think all of its films are a ride to look specifically Total Recall and Basic Instant. Jerry Goldsmith has made some of his movies including Total Recall, Basic Instance and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but are always enjoyable.
