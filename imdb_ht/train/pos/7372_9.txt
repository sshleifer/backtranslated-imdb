"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the genre genre, which many people think there is a hidden meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see this. <br /> I feel this is described with scenes like back of course and writing letters. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense visual expression and how it takes great care in writing the spike names on the head of its letters. <br /> One thing I've noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the movie was sought, the Review seems to have not fully understood the movie, as they do not even mention the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some of the reviews have not been recognized by using phrase such as: "Who is Heaton? What does it do with a delay like Spike?" This person, however, can hit the nail on the head and the remarks. Spike shows noticeable signs of A.D.D, although I do not think that this person has achieved this, as it seems to be using the word "delay" as a humiliating term. <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the faint heart. The film is very much based, after the shooting until the end there is not much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you are used to watch these deep, fearless films, stay far away.
