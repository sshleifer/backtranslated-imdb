I admit I had no idea what to expect before watching this highly stylized piece. He could heal for a zombie or cold virus common to all I knew. It started with great visuals, small fragments grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild. As he continued, I learned quickly through the voice overs that took place. A nice little neo story that I felt was not a kidney within a few minutes of my time. The little suggestions given to the audience through the visual at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the scheme. Along with a nice twist at the end it's a cool package overall. The note, though not bad, gave the movie almost a musical video feeling. She just felt a little date, adding nothing to the more scenario. Some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feeling of overalls. I walk away this very satisfying. I gave much information in a short period of time but in great correction and voice-over work he did not feel running or pushing. Good job!
