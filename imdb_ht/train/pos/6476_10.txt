A number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex plays. Crime is essentially banal, so the pay is still anti-climate, also the detailed display detracts from the human drama. The writer used a number of clever devices to try and get this round, but was not completely successful. The answer was precisely what happened and why they could be supplied, but if so properly buried. The viewer inevitably feels slightly cheated. But in a sense this is imported. The drama was never about the crime, or even the investigation, it was about the impact of events on the lives of people involved; family, investigators, witnesses, the press. And as such it fits. Writing this was an important overhead run in the mill for first-time drama, and their performance exactly the same. In an ensemble piece she is invited to focus on people, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention of a tour of extraordinary tour as the mother-wife-daughter, and Janet McTeer has been split into shape as a tough-old old boss. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is to touch the race, as the elephant in the room with no-one prepared to mention. Subtle, powerful stuff.
