I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it very much. It provides an independent film insight and how much work really involves when you have a low budget yet need an actor / actress to find people, anyone who comes to view it and gives the movie to the exposure. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder makes an excellent combination of unique Bia≈Çy Miachel, a "NAME" actor played by Alan Bates was a perfect casting of the movie and for the movie. My favorite cast member Sandy Ryan was played by magnificent and beloved Debra Kara Unger girlfriend with her own special performance again in the film in the movie. If you enjoy thinking when you watch a comedy then this one is for you. Low Budget meets lower budget and high street content.
