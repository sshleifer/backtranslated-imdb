A weird, witty and wonderful story of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something funny, foreboding and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be fooled by 2point4 happy children and cheerful characters; The show has a black side, and at times can be quite refreshment. And that's so good on the show, it's not just a simplistic sitkon where each character is a 2D funny device (the case with my family). Instead the characters are fully rounded people showing the roller coaster full of human emotions. Sometimes dark moments like Bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and Ben awakening in a rare village are two examples of the show taking a surreal, turning turn, which helps add a little depth. Of course the show is incredibly funny, and it's a guarantee to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video has stopped releasing this funny gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get caught up in unavliable episodes in the shops.
