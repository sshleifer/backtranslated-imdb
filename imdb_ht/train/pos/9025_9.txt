The film belongs to Inventor - genre genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper carry a little verve story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well-modified, and lots of assets high role. <br /> <br /> Some have stated this movie to be the classic American hokey. It is this and more. I agree with those who say "The movie celebrates thrill of youthful inspiration." The movie is a wonderful reminder that achievement can be done at ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
