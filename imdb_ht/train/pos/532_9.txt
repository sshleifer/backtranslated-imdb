Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, beyond the best known "romance death" as the Holy Spirit. While we know enthusiastically that Peter and John will get the ultimate ultimate at the end of this long staircase, the joy is on the journey. Moral in the story, of course, is timeless: love to conquer everyone. But the battle realized that victory was played in a celestial arena of visions sweeping and grandeur greatness. With over 500 extensive extras related to various ages and cultures, the vision of the directors in the sky remains memorable six decades later, far from the CGI era. But for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the story is best said at the smallest level. The beautiful, definitely romantic aspect of "stairs" is captured with ultimate simplicity: the teardrop of the June, preserved on a petal rose. <br /> This movie, like the story and put in itself, is one for the ages.
