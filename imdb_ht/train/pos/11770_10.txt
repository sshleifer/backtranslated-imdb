I was hoping that this would be a good fan of James Timothy Dalton's james and although he did not deserve '3rd bailout it was a laugh. Belushi brought some good humor to her party and dalton hammed it up nicely but it was probably underused. His party had liked a campaign up the Jack Nicholson version of some good guys. The other gross in it was a bit shocking, but in general it was a laugh.
