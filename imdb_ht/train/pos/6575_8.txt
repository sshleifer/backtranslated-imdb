'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest play if it is handled correctly, and this production makes a great job. Helena Bonham-Carter, pre-movie star, is Raina, a daughter of a military family, who has a Peacock in a fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart), and who is a soldier of the enemy (Pip Torrens) during an attack The city is full of color and energy, this dump production along a fast pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast, they still hold their ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are delightful, and the whole play is generally one happy. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
