To start off and, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. Since this version of Viggo Mortensen version of the lead role in Kowalski has helped. <br /> Is not this just like the U.S. government though, terrorizing one of its own citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But the truth, the government would do everything possible to destroy a person's life to try to find his wife's home. A wife, who at work no less, and can not do it. <br /> "There was a time in that country that the police would escort a man in his pregnant wife." Word of the jockey disc. <br /> There are some great shots in this movie, with great car chases and lots of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this movie a 7.
