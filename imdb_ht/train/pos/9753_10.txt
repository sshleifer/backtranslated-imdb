... in our home. Like everyone else commented on this movie, my brothers (7 & 4 years old at the time) and I (10) would watch this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we still go back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved the camel and would sing in the head of our lungs with him during his singing. There are some moments slowly (time spent with King Koo-Koo in court) and we generally bored after Knight's song ("why I {sound effects} is because I'm loooooove you"), but we enjoyed traveling to rescue Babbette and ending and being all a little freaked from the picture of King Koo-Koo floating has dominate the entire horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. I am still in that day singing "Hooray for me! Babbette in gay Paris!" around my friend (i'm 33 now) who just looked at me as if I had lost my mind; However, when I sing it 10 years old again remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
