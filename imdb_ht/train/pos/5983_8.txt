I saw first movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal led the world. Trick or treat has all the elements for a rock movie. With a cast that features Skippy from family ties, Gene Simmons's kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Bad message played on vinyl! Yes, that's right, used files in this movie. In one stage Eddie (Skippy) will listen to a message from the evil Rockstar on his record player when things begin to get frightened. Monsters start from its speakers and his stereo gets owned. As a teenager I tried to play my files backwards expecting it would happen to me. Nearly 20 years later, trick or treat is always one of my favorite cinema ever.
