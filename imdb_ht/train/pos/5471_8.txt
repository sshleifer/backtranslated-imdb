During 1933, this film had a lot of cuts taken from her because she was very upset for the story content and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to find great wealth and power. Papa Lily has forced her daughter to prostitution at age 14 and grew up in a steel mill in a city with poor people and her father ran a speakeasy brought to her home all kinds of male characters about Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy with everything and he is a playboy bank president. He's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr) who was only 25 when photographing This product was produced and Jimmy did not even get the first base with Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) star along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave exceptional performance. This is a great movie from 1933 produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and has been locked up in a fault for many years and just recently has been shown on the silver screen. This movie is rather serious compared with what we see on the Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of movie. Enjoy
