Horrible films and a slow start start - give it a chance to get cooked. History builds in interest and complexity. Characters and subsidized story lines are expected and stereotyped throughout the right moments. New York City's Superb - fearless, real - is a fantastic antidote of commercial imbalances of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the movie is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion in New York City, sex and relationships. It's an unusual movie that treats its characters honestly and compassionately. Love it! Great cast and remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his favorite interest (forget her name!).
