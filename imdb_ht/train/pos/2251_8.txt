I find Alan Jacobs very accurate reviews regarding the movie; however I had the opportunity to rent the DVD from Blockbuster with a Book from the BYU Curator, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. Then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film to understand their deviations from historical content for dramatic and telescoping events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith about trial. despite the great orientation of Brigham Young in Joseph Smith's defense, he was condemned anyway. And Joseph died. Historically Joseph Smith was never condemned for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum both died before the trial took place.
