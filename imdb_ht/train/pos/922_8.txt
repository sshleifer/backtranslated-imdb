At least for half an hour in a week. I was not interested in anything about the big 3 (ABC / CBS / NBC) networks of years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can get bitter times. I really love the action of the Earth's actions to bring in and Hunter. Most of the other interesting characters as well. The chair of Siegfried and Roy is fun at times, too. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best CG is made on a weekly TV show. Usually when hiring the big names of stars in a show, they try to hide a poor or poor script. Not entirely true in this show though, there are a couple of weak and improved characters by the acting voice, but in general the characters stand on their own. <br /> This is definitely for 16 and up. There is nothing here that most children have not previously heard before, and most of the jokes would probably just jump right on themselves. It's definitely not as bit and noble as South Park, but bring some of the same "Bash All" feeling in it. An example is that it makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in one episode. <br /> <br /> Father of pride and other Dreamworks production like Shrek also feels like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor growing. It can not be as witty as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. <br /> I hope it ends this season well, and it is renewed for next season. Otherwise I can never find a reason to look great again.
