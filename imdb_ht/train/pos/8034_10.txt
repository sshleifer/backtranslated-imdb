There are some movies that appear enterntainment as well as realism. If you ever wonder about the role of sniper in modern warfare, take a look at this one. I just liked the scene where bloody soldiers get shot in the jungle, no one quite sure where the shot came? <br /> And, nicked one scenes of Saving Private Ryan, so she has some merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
