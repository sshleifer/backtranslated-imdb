Revenge is the theme of this thriller Denzel Washington who offers her part of action, destruction, murder and grisly blood. Essentials are a research searcher and destroying missions as her charge, Dakota Dakota Fanning, kidnapped at school, which is exactly what Washington has hired to prevent. Mexico Cities are as chaotic as the scenario moves towards its predictable, violent conclusions, and twists drawn along the road. Washington, a former CIA operative and a drinking problem, has become a good reference to an ex-senior agent who sets in motion the plot. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a nasty start, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke have good cast in support of the stars.
