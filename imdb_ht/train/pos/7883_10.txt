I saw this movie with my friends and we could not stop laughing! I mean there was nothing to fear about this movie! It was funny all the Freddy lines said they were hilarious! I think they did not even make a new nightmare and just go to Freddy Vs. jason. Although some parts were gross (like the head blowing up). and any street elm film from 1- 5 aspire. This was the best addition to Number 1. I would not recomend this movie if you want a good horror. But if you do not have anything else to rent this and you will laugh alot.I want to see the Texas track massacre in I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead Final Final Classroom Night: B-
