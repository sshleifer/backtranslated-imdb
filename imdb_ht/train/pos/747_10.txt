Although I was born in the year that this film came out and never heard of it until my junior year in high school (1996) when I saw it I became totally hungry laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because Me and my friends were. <br /> <br /> Hair, clothes and speeches were outdated but the emotions and despair of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wanted them to make movies like that always. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this film the night after I was in a crazy party (not so unlike the one at Jay's house) that crashed by what we considered abusing The deficits are hung out on the whips of our people. A global BS'er class and "responsible" type of my mother's figure immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also one with a car) although I had a little bit of Madge's insect floating around there. My best friend was a Deidre and her best friend from our childhood was Annie. <br /> Look at the scene when Jeanie is at school or the one where she and her boyfriend broke up and then said Madge how much she liked to feel like conversation and the situation I personally had. . <br /> Now, at age 27, recently saw the movie again and felt a wave of emotions because it was like watching a piece of my own youth (if any of my friends died). I think this is a must see for every girl 13 and up.
