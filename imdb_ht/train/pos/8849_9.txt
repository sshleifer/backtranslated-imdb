The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently acting together) and Hank (clearly do not have to act together) need money. Andy comes with a plot to find some flour that will have consequences for the whole family of Hanson. <br /> <br /> This movie delivers. This is a coating, full-vigor roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a crime / thriller drama, I would be happy to compare it to 'No Country for Old Men.' While both films have a sufficient supply of character drama and emotions, 'Devil' is much more on the side of the thrill because of its fast speed. 'No Country' is a colder and smoker movie that you can truly admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The act also delivers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wild in the past, brings the jitters, sweats and deer-in-the-be-look to suggested the Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Andy, has the hardest stage film and it is quick to become the actor, whom you believe can do anything. There's really not much wrong with this movie. He jumps back and forth without confusion. Spiral events are out of control, but the film is never performed - the writing (from Kelly Masterson's first clock), directed (veteran Sidney Lumet) and remains in editing as a tough. In many categories, this is premium caliber, though perhaps the movie 'The Departed' and 'No Country' rush this one out of the limelight. If you liked these, you'll love this.
