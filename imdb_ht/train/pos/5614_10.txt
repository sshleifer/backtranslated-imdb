It took a long time until I was able to get the title of a special video in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch hollandish. I think it is one of the best horrormovies ever. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I must admit, I could not laugh at, when I saw it the first time (and was the same and second!) On the one hand Trelkovski looks nice and even beautiful in his shy behavior, but The other hand beat this man on the playground and there is no explanation for that. But the most fervent thing is to transform it into Simone Choule with the fact, that he does not know, who he really is. Its hallucinations are the most scary of this movie. Of course it all in itself, but it's this dish that carries out this female girl in her or was also before she moved to - I think this is an interesting question. Shizofrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is terrible to see its location or identity fighting against each other. The result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his window. But this awful cry - that is, that all will repeat again and again and again ... whose soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy at the hospital - this is not an incident, but a sign of my point of view.
