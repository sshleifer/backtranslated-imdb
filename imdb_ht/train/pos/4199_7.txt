The only thing about this movie that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the time, or I would buy it, because the movie is a good example of movie noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. The criteria for producing large DVDs but sometimes the cost is demanding is just a little bit. This is here for a 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound movie that is good, but nothing extraordinary, cinematic wise. The story is the story here (as opposed to visual, actor, sound, lying, etc.) as a pompus (Widmark) infernal wind and spying microfilm in his possession after Peter's pilering handbag. (say three times!). Everyone but Peters is a credible character in this film: Widmark, Cops, US and Communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe," an informant. He and Widmark are the stars in this film. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job of playing the floozy cheap but loses its credibility early on by "falling in love" with Widmark on the first meeting even though it's embarrassing it. Only in the movie world !! Too bad, because this funny romance party in the story takes away it. That's a movie medium movie that means good, but not big and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35. For that price, one might make a lot better in the movie noir market.
