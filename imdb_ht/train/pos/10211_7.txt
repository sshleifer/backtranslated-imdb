Narratives ?? whether writing, visual spice or poetic ?? generally try to avoid too much character; Readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily submerged by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. This is especially true of films, I think, simply because we can not easily come back to refresh our memory in a movie. Viewers like me, however, do not matter because we see all of our films on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I saw in the first fabulous novel of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in a very long engagement (2004) Both of them are finely fabricated and complex story with a great cast of characters. This offers much earlier than others in both ways: more character and more complexity. <br /> Now other directors used the following techniques: Robert Altman and the player (1992), Short Cut (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer has done it with a Mad, Angry, Angry, Angry World in 1963, a comedy of almost seasonal proportions. The difference with this movie is, the first director allows us to 'see' inside the top of some of the characters and the second, some scenes are repeatedly used to refresh the viewer's memory as the flip flop story between different time periods. /> <br /> Basic ?? the core, so to speak ?? Anxiety story of a young woman, Irene (Tautou) said, not a fellow fellow at a train, that she will meet her true love to this day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the movie. The smart irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the opposite of young man (Gilbert Robin) can be that 'one true love'. And, neither he ... It is way to separate them and realize potential potential to meet their close. However, the result of chaos in the rest of the day is not only for young people, but for the rest of the characters that appear in a series of cleverly constructed and tied stickers that all seem to go nowhere, and again. . <br /> <br /> If the story was simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even well predictable. Not so. The script and the rip director of our expectations and an army of innovative scenes are all too common, but they are back in credible, extraordinary events that allow these two lovers to be able to meet again. For example, the future some bird poo from the sky drop on a book or paper at you, considering your alternatives; Two characters make an obvious choice to be done before Irene and her man in destiny meet again. Or what about a rock chip flying over your shotgun? Consider again what would happen ... <br /> All that interesting enough. What was more interesting for me to evaluate each new person who came along and trying to decide if this guy was the One for Irene, or if he was, in fact, the young man on the train. That keeps me guessing for a while. <br /> I'll let you think about it, you should see this fun movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
