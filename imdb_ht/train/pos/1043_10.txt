Ever since I can remember and I'm only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because well I get them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey does not get me wrong i love the movies we have today just as much as I love cinema in the 40s and 50s) Anyways, now I said the moment I started watching the movie in my eyes was glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I liked how Betty Davis and his family described. Children ... did not act like the slightest child. But there is good reason for that, they have to hide and run most of your life, seeing these terrible things children see these days destroying their innocence. So those who say "oooo I hated how the kids were acting ... blah blah blah" between the lines and knowing they had seen things the kids would not have to see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... My dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know many angry that it goes to the Oscar and Bogie did not but the hey ones did amazing work so I think he could go either way. But Lukas's performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie very much and recommended it to anyone !! :-D
