I just looked at 2 films of Pang brother, the eye and one only took. When I looked at the eyes, I was kind of disappointed about these two guys, whom I had heard about them first. That movie (the eye) has a really bad script, especially the finish (small children, cliche and too coincidentally in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to see one only taken and I was not disappointed again. Always great photography, stunning images, MTV style editing, cool music and this time, the story has a lot of indie, logical and beautiful minds, you will see some small plot pits, but it does not cause any problems with scenarios. The only problem on this movie is to find a bad DVD.
