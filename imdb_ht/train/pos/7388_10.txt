74th Oscars were a very good. Whoopi's work as EmCee was very funny, with light. I personally liked his last apperance, which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salary jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to love it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, and Sidney Poitier did a telecast telecast to remember. <br /> <br />
