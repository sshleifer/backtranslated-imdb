Two cinemas back in the back of American pounds; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main topic itself. It does not hide that many Indian POWs are rotten in Pakistani Jails for years - for people and the Americans Govt. have time or sympathy on the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani POWs in India as well, but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a Major, Acting. Akshaye Khanna was part of his well. There was nothing to Amrita Rao doing over a few giggles and couple singing. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was stronger even though it was not too long. He acts really well here and his dialogue delivery was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, there was nothing but a long day movie and story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed movie that keeps a good speed and makes all actors happy. 7.5 / 10
