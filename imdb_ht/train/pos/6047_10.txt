The brilliant thing about Mitnail & I is that it captures that not long ago leaving college and life could go either way moment along with all its other. Freebird is something for people who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16. I know some of the great sheets stuck to the knife in this movie when it came out of movies but I saw it in a packed house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the jungle of Dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and duplicate days (there were some great - hated companions to think that they are all up to now - probably running the local council). I watched it a couple of times on DVD and I already saw the movie as an old mate who will be forever permanently as part of my collection (how can I love this movie and the dambusters - do not look like somehow) I certainly corner towards the second half of this movie and I think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliant. I love the mix of the three lead characters and there really are some nice writing in here along with some pretty quotable lines and dare I say a good smattering integrity. I tried to get the band, but it was not released (shame, as it's a corker). Someone told me it was originally a stage game, not quite sure how that worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearian / references that seem to crop up all of the movie (also locate Dylan Thomas the Ref as well) and like all little gems, there will always be little things to discover as the final scene gives a nod to Easyrider as they start their next trip. All in all a really unpretentious piece of films make (love it!)
