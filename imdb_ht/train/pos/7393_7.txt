This movie was an impressive one. My first experience with an alien movie, it's neither too long, nor too complex. I also love the subtitles; and the plot was amazing cool. The story of an adult son visiting his senior father and retarding fees after a time separation appeared crooked at first, but it proved to be very touching and realistic. There were also some subtle humor so they did not press or make the audience.
