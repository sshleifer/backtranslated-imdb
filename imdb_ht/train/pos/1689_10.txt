This movie is Halloween what hilarious "Christmas story" is in Christmas: both are relatively low-budget, no-great-non-star movie types ... and both are two of the absolute most movies great and fun available, both season CLASSIC !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters ... all five harsh jumps, the realtor Klembecker, Russell deputy, Vern's "gas dispensing" and many more ! You just need to see this film for believing it, and, like "Christmas story", it just keeps getting better and better with every look and you pick up on fun little things every time! THAT IS DEFINITION OF A TEN !!!
