Somerset Maugham characters lead to life in RKO "of human bondage"; but the movie is a version of skeletons in the novel, and Bette Davis' star-performing performance sucked up all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); She dreamed of becoming a painter, but she says she has no talent for art. As the movie progresses, fight Mr. Mr. Howard, instead of becoming a doctor. Its efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; Even though the success of medicine, painting it seemed easier - also, remember the symbol of its disability, a "foot club" (explained in the movie). <br /> <br /> Along the way (right away, in this version), Howard becomes infatuated with Davis waitress (like Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when he told Howard, among other things, that he was in "WIPE UP!" after kissing him. Howard also does well, but the neglected story explains its extended passion and love for Davis; So performance is wasted. <br /> Still, a movie to look for the act, including some good supporting players. Animal Davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a "writing-in" campaign for the 1934 "Best Comedy" Academy Award. For the record, he puts third. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It happened one night" <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts at Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3 Bette Davis - "In Human Bondage" <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "A Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* In Human Bondage (6/28/34) Jan Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
