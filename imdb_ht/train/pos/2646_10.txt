I think the majority of people seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure is a movie about drug abuse; instead it is a movie about how to think about these engineering costs, the drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see everyday and if the author wanted it, it definitely failed, as most people think it's one of the many related cinemas movies. I, however, think something else is the case. As in many movies that show different cultures, audiences usually fully understand movies that show their own culture, something they have grown up and are quite familiar with them. This film is showing what people "genius" people often think of and what they face. The reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds :) They have to meet those who do such things with and accept things as if they launch space craft on the basis of everyday. They begin a fairly hard job and excel in no time. They feel like -I went to work, did not do anything, always doing twice as best as the guys around me when they were all over the projects, what I should do now and time my free. And what's even more boring? When you can begin to predict that behavior is not because you are psychologist, but rather because you have seen this model in the past. So, for them, from one side to it is a difficult task, which is also fairly boring sometimes, and in another to begin to figure out human behavior. It's a recipe for big big burgers. And these dumbest things usually do get out of this state. They are earlier guys who mention that major issues are that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic (mathematics describing logic), while life is not really something logical, is actually absolutely right.
