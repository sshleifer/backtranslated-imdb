When Kei lost one friend he gave her until she met Sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. The street streets of Mallepa are struggling for their own place among a melting pot in Asian races, and learning that sometimes they have been overhead can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay. A surprise that end up being as much as the movie is all done. I could not get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do a nice job of acting, proving they are more than beautiful boys who sing.
