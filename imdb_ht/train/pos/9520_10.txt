This is a beautiful movie. The true story of bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks of his finest. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. It usually has the role of beautiful guy. But in this movie, he comes to this movie as a little frightening, but still appears smell like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. The movie has been put together properly. I also like the party when there is silence totally when Tom Hanks' character throws and kills all of the guys in Mr Rooney's group. There is something refreshing and yet profound to no sound at this stage, just merely emotions. I like to watch Jan Rooney, the character of Paul Newman's character when he realized even before seeing him, that he is Tom Hanks's character is getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this film I was blown and knew I was going out and getting the video with me since winning, adding it to my favorite ever favorite movies. <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in my.
