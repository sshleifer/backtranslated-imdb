good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable scheme. but the main point again as movies it tends to be, the man is the best actor in Ida and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar. This might be her second best performance after parinda (others can agree). Although other movies are not far behind. one who never will ever disappoint you. <br /> <br /> good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury movie that could be done without. You can see in his movie, others try very hard to reach his height and act out of the skins. but this man is really something elated. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool, the music and direction are excellent draws a bit thin but the screen play and dialogs are still very good. a must look.
