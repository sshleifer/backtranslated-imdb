I liked this show when he was revealed on TV and crashed when I found that someone somewhere decided he was not worthy to continue! For years I hung on my copy of this show, those that I had stuck or had someone tape for me. That is until now. The powers must finally decide to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally could get my hand but little on the complete set. Which, bring me to that part; The part about showing this is all about. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about good verse, basically a struggle between Lucas Buck (which is Buck, and a B). He is an evil sheriff in a small South Carolina town that runs things as he wants things to be running and stop at nothing to get his way. <br /> I felt the wonderful writing and directing show and much of life was left to live. I was really hated when it was canceled, but this is the way it looks for me when I finally find something worth watching on TV. Gary Cole has done a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of evil verse to pull it off. The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you might say, even the casting was a hit with me.
