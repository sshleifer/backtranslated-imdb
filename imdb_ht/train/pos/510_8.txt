I just watch this for the first time in a long time - I've forgotten both how imaginative the images were, and how witty the movie is. I have not forgotten however the opening scenes which are (and the scene of the Candle Club at Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic romantic ever. Anyone interested in politics or story will love referrals offhand the movie - anyone interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who likes visual imagery will enjoy the deposition of afterworld. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd name" made near the same time - but this one is superb. <br /> <br />
