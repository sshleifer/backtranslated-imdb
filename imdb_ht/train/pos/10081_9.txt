This is a beautiful, rich, and well-executed movie with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it tells how an old story teller needs to find an (inherited) heir to carry on his craft but ends up not finding what he expects in his very hometown to dominate his world. Characters to be then dealing with situations with the old master must be contenders with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir to the traditional notion of his or her society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional, and complex. The exploration of the characters, lives, and emotions, is rich and compelling character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimension at all. The film employs the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and compelling show how he and the kid handle the situation. There are also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at the appropriate point. The film also examines good and bad in traditional Chinese culture, creates more interest and depth of film. <br /> <br /> R direction, act, and scenery are all outstanding. Added to the other forces creates images rich and convincing visual and compelling, real characters. As a result, the movie boasts strong sympathy for, and feelings about, the characters. <br /> Some have stated that the finish has weakened the movie, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could be stronger with a different finish, but any improvement in the movie overall would have been rather small.
