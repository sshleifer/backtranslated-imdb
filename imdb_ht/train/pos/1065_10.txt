Dark Angel is a set of futuristic sci-fi, set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, Central on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically reinforced young woman, on the run from her creator. <br /> <br /> The Dark Black Sunglasses are absorbed, (not as much as saying Buffy, but absorbed however) with an interesting and credible set of characters. Certainly, it's not for everyone, but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable scenes out there. Black Angel is criminally neglected, and under-rated, and was unfortunately canceled after only 2 series. That was a great shame, as this was the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy in long run BBC Sci-Fi comedy red nose. As Angel Angel is left unfinished, so get out of it, and if you want more, Fox groups do another series.
