Full marks for Pacino's rendering of the talk about the dead casket of the kid; Mark Shakespeare's brand would be disappointed ... <br /> Is Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper that should compliment the dialogues remarkable? They are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you love movies and good scripts. I found the narrative story developing well quite right up to the voice on postScript. <br /> <br /> There are little other things to talk about in this movie; Even John Cusack did better than this one. Interestingly, the film is very men orientated - women are only Appendix.
