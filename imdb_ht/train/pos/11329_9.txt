The combination of superb black and white photography and the 'Eugene Onegin with a twist' draw did a real knock out for me. The atmosphere created by shots is mostly very dark contrary to occasionally very bright overexposed white was adapted. There was a superb moment where transparency - apparently conventional holidays but where the faces of the actors revealed characters and subtle situations, but immediately - were shown accompanied by Lensky's heart-wrenching aria from the opera Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. /> To mark in a good movie is that it should take advantage of the opportunity presented by this, which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - Last year in Marienbad is a good example of like a movie. Krisana is in the same mold.
