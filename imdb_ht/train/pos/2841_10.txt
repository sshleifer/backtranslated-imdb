As a Paris Je'Taime fan, I went to New York, I love you with very high expectations. I was happy to walk out with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and fun. The movie starts out with two taxi hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get into the same area but discuss what way to go. That was funny, and then the movie went on some of the best sketches I've ever seen anywhere. There were amazing amazing maps from all the good ones. Those four cards will start talking about. One of the features of Shia LaBeouf as a bell to a hotel that finds love of an old lady. One of the next features is Orlando Bloom as a music maker doing business with a woman playing by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people go to the ball, Thirbly's character was disabled. Best one of the features of Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a brutal couple. I'll bring you the attention that Nataile Portman has made an impressive first direct director, and writes a skit on a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I love you is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The well-paced skits, and the movie shows how independent films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing number of great performances, and just plain to be entertained then definitely go see New York, I love you.
