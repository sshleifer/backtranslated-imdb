Some movies or movies I consider favorites over the years. The gospel road was one of them. I watched this as a teenage teens and would like the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite part was the fact that <br /> 1 / Jesus was blonde, <br /> <br /> The last two foods was a great meal, <br /> 3 / he liked to play with the kids , <br /> 4 / death it was for everyone and forever. The film can not have the theological sound or quality of act, but it touches my heart at that time. Besides I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture. If it ever comes out on DVD, I'll buy it purely for sentimental reasons.
