Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerous" in this take-off on Gangster cinema making in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. The other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930's who catches a kid stole a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he gets owned by the pet store. He turned to gossip at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a boyle boss. Johnny uses the last names "Dangerously" in the mobster world. There are some hilarious scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's sick mother needs ever organs in her body to replace. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, such as making Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA that will not "play ball" with burr burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is an exceptional as Morony, who tortured the English - but you must hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that it does it all with an angry face. The movie gets slightly tired in the end, but it's well worth seeing, and Keaton is terrific as good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was merged when he was released, and like the other Keaton Gem, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you will find "Johnny Dangerous" incredibly enjoyable.
