I did not expect this to be affected by this movie showing a family just like the one you would expect to be living next door. They are ordinary people-and-without people, not as Hollywood's typical cost. They face an all-too-common problem - illness disability. But the story-line heart flu and a powerful lesson. Distribution, script, direction, and flow acting together with a wave that draws the deep viewer to the story. Give this film your attention and message it will really inspire.
