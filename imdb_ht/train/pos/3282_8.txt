Do not know what this film was about, I checked it out of the video store and after seeing it, I enjoyed it. Little see the multi-genre flick of director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and character. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception to this movie ended. However, it's worth a rent.
