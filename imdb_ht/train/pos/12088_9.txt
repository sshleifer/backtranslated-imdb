Hardcastle and McCormick are an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very predictable as the Dukes of the Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc. etc. <br /> This show is just good TV own. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite fun. They often take jabs at each other several times an episode, which adds a great deal of humor to the show. He has several cars chassis in almost every episode but, who does not enjoy a good car running? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> I only want to have made their own TV like this today I highly recommend this!
