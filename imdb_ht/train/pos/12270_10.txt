I searched for this movie for years, apparently it is not available here in the United States so bought me a copy of Ebay. <br /> Four young hunter and three of the enterprising girlfriends in the woods searching for a bear that apparently killed several comrades. What they find is an ancient Vietnam vet goes crazy (it kills some of its victims using a long-haired Freddy Krueger metal glove). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a short argument with her boyfriend and she dies. After one of the groups found his body, they all hide in the tents waiting for daylight. Once the sun rises, all of them try and make it out, but fall victim to one by one. <br /> <br /> Six body, not a lot of gurus, but a couple of good murders, especially the girls' death. The men get killed in a bit without sense (blow in car, shot of death, head knife). <br /> <br /> Overall, TRAP INFORMATION is a beautiful slasher movie from late 80's. Nothing new, just acted, fast paced and some nice ladies. 10 out of 10.
