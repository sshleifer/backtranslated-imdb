This is a movie that can make you want to see it again. I especially, liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Law was not blown away the first time, one suspect it will come back again. The story is appealing and it may have been more psychological, but I understand the necessary story to capture the viewer and the action was needed. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe Michael Jr. so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as she moves. But I can appreciate the scene play could not really take our attention because it has a bigger story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe that is not justified. If his character was any harder, he would not have to care if his son pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
