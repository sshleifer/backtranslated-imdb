If you're a fan, then you'll probably enjoy this. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca, or Cinema Cedar, this is not the movie starting out with. It's very nice, funny, the girls are hot, and it's fun to look. There is no gender regardless of the very end of 45 minutes in minutes, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not a total make. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in the lower braid, so it's not as hot in this as it was in others. But her panties in this is quite nice (you'll just have to watch the movie so it does not sound really strange). If you do like this one, you will probably enjoy this "Female 70", "Vampire Vixens", or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). If you prefer watching Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, overhead / exploitation based (but lower budget) movies, check out the 2000 factory site.
