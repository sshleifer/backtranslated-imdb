Another Spanish film about the Civil War 1936. This time we told about Carol's stories (beautifully played by Clara Lago beginners), a girl who came to live in a Spanish town in New York. It is such an insider trip, and soon it will get on the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and their conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes her best movie since "Dias Contados" (1994) and such a heartbeat, a beautiful photography, and a beautiful script. He tries not to participate in the conflict, it shows us some facts and let's decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide on which band we are) and take a great advantage to the freshness of the young couple begins: Clara Lago and Juan Jos√© Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-behaved production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
