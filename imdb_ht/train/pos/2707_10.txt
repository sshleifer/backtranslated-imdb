Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me as it is a comedy master. Billy Zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the pieces together are a joy to see. I recommend that you watch this movie with a bunch of comrades, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and preparing to be amazed and very entertained. This brings about it perfectly from cheating chiefs like Plan 9 From outer space that it is in the true "B" movie tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of people who participated in the movie. Ron Pearlman for example. I still get myself giggling in the scene where Zane goes down a series of steps so there is no apparent reason to almost a ballet style. All a bit crazy, and all the best for it.
