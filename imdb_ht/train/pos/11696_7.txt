"A Thief Of The Night" is a film that was generally ignored by the great movie fan due to its low-budget (which was evident) and its subjects - the rapture of true Christian church and the fate of those quotes behind. But it was an attractive story that made the viewer and definitely made him or he reviewed their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touches everyone - showing even a pastor who preached the Word, but he did not believe it, knows exactly why he left behind. This film, with its sequel "far thunder," must be seen movies. Even with the new "Left Behind" series comes out, tells the same story with a higher budget, the impact is still the same - "A thief in the night" broke the ground in this genre and they will always be remembered.
