This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love dance and ran to this movie in the video store. We had to find it. Non-violence and such a story warms her a great movie to relax in and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a beautiful movie.
