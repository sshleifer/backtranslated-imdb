this is a great movie. I love it where Ning climbs down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase after him, but luck to dodge them, open the window, and not even notice them. xiao qian is very nice too. & when it sticks the needle up the Ma Wu's butt, its hysteria. and when he said that love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between the two swords is great too. Then also the party where he eats his bread while watching your guy kill many. Then you see him singing poems as he ran to escape the wolves. The scenes love are romantic, xiao qian and ning look nice together. adds the funny distribution, the giant language, and u have horrors, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention splendid special effects for the 90s.
