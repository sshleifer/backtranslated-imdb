Let's think people, leaving the original bad pig, for her when the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece, even with all the stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was great as Adam and Richard Hatch were perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny as Starbucks, but I dare say, not as beautiful as Katee as Starbucks. I liked the episode and the Pegasus and greetings from Earth was good to Jan Calicos was great as Baltar, the god war, the best was the Terra Experience, I thought was a tribute in a way to Heaven It can wait, then you've got the women in Battlestar, do not compare them to the Tricia who is pretty much as Number Number, but Jane Seymour's beauty can not be compared to. Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic .He had the beauty that a rainbow would embarrass. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos had a six number? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
