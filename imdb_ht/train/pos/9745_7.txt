As someone commented, this is a feeling-good movie. It had beautiful scenery and the wonder-filled voice of Luciano! I saw this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon. I would forget how much I missed Pavarotti's song in Nessun Dorma and I needed to get out the CD! It's a great movie just as far away from the fun and reverie afternoon. Eddie Albert is great as the agent and a bit on the head, but all the agents are just that anyway. The Italian country is gorgeous but has nothing to do with the balloon ride for the perfect look. If you need to act in the role of Olivier, this film is not for you. If you just want a flight of fancy and some nice music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
