I can only echo the praise of the other comments here. It's a delightful movie with a fever factor that it achieves without crossing the line of soppy sensitivity. Of course sweet - no added sugar. <br /> One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections raised on Ustinov's Pendelton character being able to walk through and defeat the security system ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / scout in this sort two things. Yes, the movie was very illiterate computer, but it showed Pendelton 'studying computer' in his flat, and I believe the implication was supposed that his gift allowed him to simply influence the whole subject, practically overnight. <br /> There was an odd moment when he appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bladder. I'm not sure if we were supposed to believe Pendelton uprising weaselled his way out of those situations, or if he was actually enough knowledge to pass the tests - it was a bit clear. <br /> Certainly he knew enough to set up the squeaky accounts. Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own notions of how their computer worked on those days, and in order to understand in detail what they got in, it is necessary to know well what the concepts they were. They knew there was something about 'important' procedures; They thought that the 'smart spirit' could actually control security, rather than just indicating its state; They thought that the user (mute) features would strongly influence what can be done on the mainframe itself - even apart from things like graphic features I do not see it meself. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they try to avoid the subject of real computer operations as far as they can, and they did it quite well. Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts had any defect worthy of note. <br /> <br /> CD
