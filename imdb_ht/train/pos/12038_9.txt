Yes, a true classic! This is what the British drama is all about, realism and the minimal use of special effects (and budget inflation). I recently saw this drama when it was recent screening on British terrestrial television in 1994. It really should be seen by everyone who loves a scary scheme, there is no big name but no-less-great act. While the copywrite is now owned by an unknown person and as such great drama is unlikely to be revealed anytime soon. I also recently acquired the Woman in Black on VHS, so now once again I will be able to enjoy this truly great British dramatic. You should try and enjoy it too! <br /> Mark R. Horobin
