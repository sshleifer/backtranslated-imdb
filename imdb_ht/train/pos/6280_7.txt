If you like your car you will love this movie! <br /> There are some superb actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, and its typical no nonsense attitudes and appearance of drivers. others are not bad either .... <br /> There are only two slight shortcomings in this movie. Firstly, the poor scheme, however, does not look like this movie for the plot. Second, glorification of Grand Theft Auto (crime machine). However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then look good at them, hope you have a good time in prison! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage was the main acting role, I thought first "... sweeet." But then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" but then finally after watching the movie I realized "... yes it's jumping!" .. only play it playing the role very well. <br /> I'm going to end this unexpected review by saying "If the front too early of a criminal has in some ways enlightened the general cinema to go audience as the finish smashed under the brilliant guise of criminal life, and inspired to change Their way, then this death brings with it a inherent nobility. With a superb glory, I should say "Our poor." <br /> - Angelina Jolie Voight looks nice!
