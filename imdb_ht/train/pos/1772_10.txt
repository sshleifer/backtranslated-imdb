what a relief to find out I do not imagine this program! The summary from taxation is huge. I also remember to get it haunted and not particularly watched by family, I must have been 10/11 at the time I saw it. I think for a girl whose age part of attraction has been very blond hair lead, and his permanent sad state. The theme was played on a flute I remember - although I can not remember how it goes. I think the intro showed him playing it - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Perhaps my destiny never knows how it ended or they watched the clip or heard the music, but at least I now know it is not just me.
