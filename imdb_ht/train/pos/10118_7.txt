I really love film Miikes on Yakuza, this one I've seen about 2 years ago and it really fuels myself. Never before seen something sick and twisted. The story is good with the actors doing things very well. I have not seen UK or Japan versions, but I said that I believe that the German DVD is a little controversial. If you have not seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Dutch or Austria. The I-ON DVD has a lot of scenes that are very difficult and embarrassing, but in the confrontation I felt that something was missing, on one or two very short scenes. <br /> All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, I love Miike for !!
