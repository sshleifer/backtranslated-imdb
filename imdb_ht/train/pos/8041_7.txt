The film has some good moments as Beckett, veteran's marine, taking a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate a drug cartel drug cartel and the corrupt common army that could be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what he entrusts to achieve. <br /> <br /> Miller, the newly-arrived arranger in the jungle and the guerrilla war between the military officials and drug traffickers in infiltrating the American Intelligence, has learned an important lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle. Tom Berenger is an actor who does not register so much, as he proves in this movie, but in the context of the movie, he is right as a man in a few words. Billy Zane plays Miller doing what she can with a role that does not pay him any glory until the end is important. <br /> <br /> For action films lovers, "shooter" offers a 112 minute of action and a bit of reduction would have made a movie more satisfying.
