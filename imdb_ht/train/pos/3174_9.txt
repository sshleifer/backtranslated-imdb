Very rarely one comes across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The writer's director not only tackles the challenge of directing his own work, but provides a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look at not only the combat of writers of difficulty, but mixing many comedians in the desert world of the writer that you can not help but commit Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Although the small budget Adam Jones managed to give the film a serious look. He does not spare around when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what it comes with next. This guy can make people laugh and think; this is special.
