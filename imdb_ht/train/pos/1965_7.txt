I found this movie to be very good in all areas. The act was brilliant in all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. The draw is interesting though, this film is more so for the idea of ​​playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues to write it with new ways and twists for her novel. The environment was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was mysterious, thrilling as prince. Going to this film now, she deserved better than she received from the audience, being deceived by some awesome angry reviews on the movie (Before she even started) ..... You will not regret it , if you go see it ...
