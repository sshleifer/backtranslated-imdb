I just can not believe that these games can get so much better, but they do. Unfortunately I rented a Dreamcast to play it, but even though I beat it I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only set of games that I must own all of them though I've been beating them many times over. I hope they never stop doing this kind of game though the series must come to an end. <br /> <br />
