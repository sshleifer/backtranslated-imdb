Let's face it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst epic at any show I had ever enjoyed (especially I never found the exact spells of an entire season). But if you judge this show in the last season, of course it will come across as inferior. This is a totally unjust assessment - because "This 70s show" was, in its days, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom on a vintage era and how the people who lived there were not so different than us here modern times. All the stars are like Eric Forman, a horny geek at a teenager and an everlasting love at Donna (Laura Prepon), feminist girl next door. Playing friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) provide the fantastic performance (almost) every episode. One of the best is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is as promiscuous mental as they get. Which country does it come from? Try to figure it out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, is both formidable and sweet, the sort of like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while the Red Smith exists mainly to scare the poets from everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, Bob Chauvinist, but likable and the Airheaded midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearance as Leo, a stoner who acts as a Hyde father figure. <br /> <br /> Apart from the anachronistic mistakes that pop up quite often with the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come (with that depleting final season), "70s" is a terrific and amazing show place, -in the direction, and a good-vibe feel in every episode. They are all well.
