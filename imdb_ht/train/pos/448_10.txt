I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I do not refer only to the breathtaking scenery. It's two of the Happy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their lives not so happy happy. At the end of the four women total rental rates together, all with different personality and different reasons for being there. In this wonderful magic place they all find the peace they are eager to see and interesting that peace comes from reflection inside and resolution, more so than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationship that they develop out of kindness and understanding. The act is a joy to look at itself. I especially love the characters of loti (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
