The first time I saw this movie on TV a few years ago and frankly loved it. Charles Dans makes one of the most fearless bandits anyone can imagine. His literacy is like a perfect contrast to the hero very good. I've never been much of a fan of Eddie Murphy but to find his irritating paint here is a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is, using a hackneyed phrase but the only one that applies, glowing glitter. Some scenes create beautiful: the sequel to the dream, the bird, the funny fighting scenes, and climate confrontation. Through it all Murphy is the modern man suddenly collapsed in an Oriental myth, a stunning version and toll of Kurt Russell in his fabulous Oriental arch. As films we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scene, however short, raises the same quality of Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined the actor to support fine, "acting in class" in his profession. "The Golden Child" is amazing; it is not perfect; but it has many features to ruin that it is an enjoyable and fun fan, well worth seeing. After four years I saw the "Golden Child" again; I liked it even more! It really is great fun.
