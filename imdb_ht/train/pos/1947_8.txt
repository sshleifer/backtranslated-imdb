SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the finish was a bit abrupt. I would like to see the crew adjusting to life back to earth after returning. I suppose the writers anticipate this problem by "loading ahead" some Voyager over the earth's sequence at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this time line has been eliminated, so it's all moot.) I did like how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get to have our cakes and eat it, no Janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and his older self whose conversation was scarce and so easily could cross the line in the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) pulled it off.
