This is a totally delightful and unexpected movie. You start to track a young person who hopes to get into the skilled football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran is to be found in the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is the young person is a girl and girl (or woman for that matter) are not allowed in football matches in "sitting with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with competent skill by a small cast ensemble. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's liberty (and for that problem the young soldiers who have the choirs). There are some excellent set pieces, not least when one of the girls must go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium has no toiletries for women. The camera work is in the simplest and in some ways this story can be said as a stage play. But it is the small scale that gives the movie its bite. Great movie? No, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
