See this today and I'm 8 years old. I thought it was nice. I agree with the other post that it was not anything like the book that I can remember, but we still enjoy it. All children are very good and all in all fun. Billy is the new kid who accepts a daze by intimidating the school to eat 10 glasses a day. If she loses she walked down the hall to the school and glass in his pants. The beginning of the film is set up to show that Billy has a very weak stomach and pukes of almost anything. Hilarity indices and a bunch of different ways to cook the worms. Good message about standing up to crude and of course, a happy happy ending.
