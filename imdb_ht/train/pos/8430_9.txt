She is always nice to see Angela Bassett getting a role that she can really shed her teeth. It's at times intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "color" woman forced to make a home on a mudbank just outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also a very clever role as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah provides a finely nuanced performance as a foreigner who discovered Boesman and Lena's new living area. It's not often that you get a chance to see a smart movie dealing with mature terms. Although it is based on a play, the late John Berry director (also led Claudine) opens the material up there by the movie shot in the widescreen sinisimop format. It also keeps visually interesting things from the creative stroke of actors and does not show us anything just mentioned in the play. Just like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have headed Angela Bassett at an award nomination Academy. This is definitely a movie worth looking.
