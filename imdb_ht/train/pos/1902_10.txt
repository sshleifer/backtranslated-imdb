Let's start with this song singing by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the moon and New York City." It's a great theme and singing even after all these years, it never gets tired. It really is a great song about New York City as well. Anyway, the big Dudley Moore CBE stars are like a drunken millionaire who is engaging Jill Eikenberry's character in the movie. Jill would later star on the law. Anyway, he was served by his handsome British Butler, Sir John Gielgud OM who won awards Academy for his performance in the movie as Best Actor Support. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character who is perfect in this movie besides his performance in the role of Oscar winning in cabaret. No, Liza does not find songs. She plays a diner waitress. Anyway, I like Geraldine Fitzgerald as family matriarch family who decided to fortune family. Anyway, it's fabulous and should have gotten a award-winning academy nomination for best actress trading. Barney Martin is best known as Jerry's father on Lina's father's Seinfeld play. It's great too. The film was well written, acting, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.
