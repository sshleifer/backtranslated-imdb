Says Andy: "No one does not hurt, everyone has." Before saying it, we know the opposite is true: Everyone has become hurt, nobody has. This is a new beach in American cinema, or maybe an old beach brought back to last time. Think "Promising Eastern", "There Will Be Blood", "No Country for Adult Men". These films are dark, serious, very well done, and do not care about happy endings. I love them. "Before the Devil knows you die" fits the general description but creates an atmosphere of its own. Kelly Masterson's first script is as close as a Hollywood movie is ever found in a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet expert and soberly turns the gloomy story into an outstanding, old school character drama. The opening vaccine, although in a obituary dog-maning bookkeeper his trophy, have the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting. Conversely, the drug dealer's condominium looks more like a string of World War II. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finney Charles character feels a little over-acting, wide eyes and agape mouths all the time. But then it is in deep trouble, deeper than any of the most difficult issues we'll ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you do not need to tell you that. Why Gina's character would want them with a guy like Andy, we've never said, but that's okay. Action is character, after all. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
