This is a feel-good movie and nothing more. And for that, it is great fun to look. Ensure it skims on political issues. But what? I'm sure he was not trying to do 'good night and good luck' here. Let's not try to do anything else but what it is ... light fare. <br /> <br /> And very enjoyable in that! <br /> <br /> Do you remember what 1984 was like? We have become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we look or not. I have different tendencies on this point. Goldie knew this was fun-fluffy and he went ahead and did it. Like her lightweight ticket: Protocol, More, Housesitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Looks like Old Times, Crowds Play, Deaths to Become, First Club Club and Remark in Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... it plays all the role of the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie just knows his head really well, and she knows what she can do really well. He always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently. I loved her in laughing-in with everything she's ever been to. She never tried to be anything else, but which she is ... and that bubbling, gigli, girl next door that happens to be very beautiful and has a smile and a laugh that will always love me and remind me that life is very short and you've just got lightened up because before you know it ... you old, ride and suffering from one of life's inevitable diseases. If it even comes late. <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what it is: a lovable, funny actress.
