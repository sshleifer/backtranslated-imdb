I came in among this movie so I had no idea about any credit or even title until I looked at her here, where I saw that she received a mixed reception by your commentator. I'm on the positive side regarding this movie but one thing really keeps my attention as I watch: the beautiful and tender note written in a Coplandesque American style. My surprise was great when I discovered the note written by none other than John Williams himself. True he wrote sensitive and poignant notes such as Schindler's List but one usually associated his name with bombasticities like Star Wars. But in my opinion what Williams wrote for this film surpasses anything I've ever heard of it for sensitivity, sensitivity and beauty, completely in keeping with the sensitive and beautiful behavior of the movie. And another recent note of it, to catch me if you can, show more comprehensiveness and sophistication. As Stanley and Iris, I love education movies like How Green was My Valley and Konrack, which one with John Voigt and his young African American in South Carolina, and the Renaissance Danny deVito, etc. They say a necessary story in intellectual and spiral arise, a story that can not be said often enough. This one is an excellent addition to that genre.
