Working in romantic drama classes from director Martin Ritt is as incredible as they come, but there are moments of fun due mainly to the charisma of star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific). She is a widow who can not move on, she does not know with a closet-inventor - you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of the novel "Street Barker Street" (a better title!) So put it back on bold, and the movie editing is a mess, but it's still nice; a rosy-hued fantasy-necklace fantasy. There is no opening of serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plot-tool for the love story learning) and no real fireworks, even though the characters are intentionally somewhat colorless and their tone leads down to a degree interesting. The final is pure and cynical duvet will find it difficult to swallow - even though these two characters deserve a happy ending with the picture would not really be satisfying any other way. *** from ****
