In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others helping put it in perspective. A relatively forgettable but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and the largest in size is Indochine's unforgettable. Claire Denis has produced a film that has some of the grand foundations of Indochine, the complex relationship with the senses between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> I was struck with the dignity of Potee, and her struggles to maintain her dignity among her classmates and his white patron. I also struck with the love / love relationship between him and Aimee. It is the letter that gives the film its driving force, it is the letter that links this Indochine movie. One never is sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters are required to be in a memory of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that links it to Coupe de Torchon. It is the story more scandalous, perhaps even more interesting in a way that has lost way, but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it has been with all the tensions and unresolved relationships. The American black that gives adult France a ride at the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting confusion that we in the Western world have when we look to Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call all fees. He came home, but they just thought he had to be a little daft. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon but did not fully understand what it is though they can remember how it was.
