Bizarre, Trippy, memory-over-a-story-and-full-steam-advance scan budget sci-fi on the Williams family, living in the California desert. They witnessed a series of events that increased in the levels of weird; Apparently, they were kept in a time-space driver, where past, present and future collision. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of very fun special effects - a constant light and sound sound, dinosaur-like creatures that are in each other, a friendly and tiny little girl who is enchanted child girl, and so on. This picture shows a little imagination, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, engaging special effects work from the love of David Allen, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a likable family is quite key. It generates a sense of love for people; It can be very good that it's more of a stencil for children (or children in many of us) that can glaze over any flaw in the narrative or presentation. <br /> I found it hard to resist; It's a short and sweet (80 minute) rehab, with a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (in the "Kingdom of the Iron" fame) and executive producer Charles Band.
