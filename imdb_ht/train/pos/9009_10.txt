This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth .... in the most delightful, light-hearted way. It's not a serious, but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> History of life mirrors. We do not always find what we want right away but we get to find what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted .... that result in us getting more than we thought we would get! You will find this once you see the movie. This film is really about finding love and knowing that one has found it and that it totally changes one's life. <br /> It's one of my favorite time .... .. not easy to find but worth the hunt ......... I guarantee you'll watch it over once!
