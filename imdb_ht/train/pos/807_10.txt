Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> Final Battle between Rebellion and Empire. The second Star Death is approaching completion and will fill out bankruptcy for the Alliance Rebel. Luke Skywalker, now a Knight Jedi, returns from Tatooine to Han Solo and Princess Leia, now releases as Luke's twin sister! They agreed to bring the attack on the Shield on Forest Moon in Indor while Lando Calrissian led the attack on Star Death. Little is known that a most ingenious trap has been set up for the Emperor Palpatine himself to personally supervise the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> Back to Thursday is my favorite in the original trilogy. He has action, drama, romance, great fighting, fantastic acting, amazing battle scenes, and awesome music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now at a Jedi Knight, goes on to the naive girl firm and in its place is a cool, relaxed Thursday determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie perform their role in a T while James Earl Jones is still the worst mechanic movie: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent writer as a painful and brutal painter Palpatine emperor. The sequel to this movie is breathtakingly amazing and the swords and battles are swords. Williams Williams's score is always fresh and enhances the movie by many levels. <br /> <br /> sign, the DVD Converter Constant
