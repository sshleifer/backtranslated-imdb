And this is a rock'n'oll movie great in itself. No matter how he evolved (at the point of being a film about disco), he ended up as one of the ultimate films in which kids want to rock out, but the principal stands in the way. Think back to these rock'n'roll movies in the 50's in which the day saved when Alan Freed came to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for kids, and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweater for the dance. Going to the 1979, repeating the same plot, but throwing at DA RAMONES, who no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands in the next century (and then for passengers to invite DJ to the "Real Estate" Don Steele). Throw in, too, all the elements of a Roger-Corman comedy-exploited film production, except for the schedule of two days, some of the familiar players Corman repertoire such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (since "The Pot Blood "), and you've got one of the big stoopid movies in the day. One of the few films that uses delicate cheese and gets away with it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing her part of a homemade-driven drive in the drive, and she agreed that this is one of the great movies to watch, not least for the beautiful leading lady and great Ramones feet.
