Maybe I identified and caused this movie I live in nyc and suffers from bad insomnia but whatever it is, I have to praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job. do what he did without budget ... Wow, all I can say. really, really good. like no money being spent on this movie and still blew me away. I definitley suggested checking it out if you can. great direct, fantastic notes and of course a script that will hit you on your donkey. see it.
