Sex bender sex things up a bit for x-files. This episode has an interesting site, a good story, but a sequel that wants. Sex Bender is also the first x-record for actor Nicholas Lea, best known as Alex Krycek. In this episode she plays Michael, a man attacked by one of the "Kindred". You need to see this episode just to see Nic Lea's less spectacular start. Something interesting about the "power of seduction" Kindred. When Marty makes it to his victim, they come back to him / her. However, when Andrew Scudly seduced, he only because disoriente and groggy, and did not come to attract Andrew. Perhaps Marty is more experienced than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why she would sometimes have miserable movie up in British Columbia. Throughout the episode it is so wet, soft, and mud, it could not have been that much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Sex Bender is still a decent episode to see.
