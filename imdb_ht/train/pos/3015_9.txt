Why can not this type of compact, fun mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps thinking of the viewer and guessing the way. Throw is a great ensemble. William Powell displays true quality stars. Who knows - maybe it was recurrence for his future as Nick Charles. It's a joy to watch. One can also see why Eugene Palette made more than 200 films. He is a great actor character supported with his excellent chemistry and Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor performs above average work in a very meaty role. All other hand chips in making this a pretty enjoyable way over 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball that led his one. Bravo!
