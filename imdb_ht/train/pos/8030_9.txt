This was another big Berenger Tom movie .. But some people right it was like another character SGN BARNES but it was still awsome .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the forests of Panama! Billy Zane was a sly at first just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but then he got a little more aggressive to the end! The awesome shooter and action enthusiasts should watch it .. I remind you he would not have as much action as a reg action action .. I got this one on DVD too and it's excellent!
