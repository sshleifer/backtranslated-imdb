Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great screen team and this could be the best film together. <br /> Yes, keep people you can cheesy and predictable, but this is not what I like about the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie are simply wonderful. It is obvious that they really enjoy working together and that is part of what makes this a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this a good movie. I liked this movie the first time I saw it and on every subsequent look I still notice at least a new detail. For me, that's a brand of a big movie. The dialogue and script are better than most movies in this time period (early 30's). I worship classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just averaging and at times not keeping my interest. Keeping your person is one of the exceptions. <br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that keeping people you are a 'pre-code' movie. (Code Hays has not been applied until one year after Keeping Your Man.) This movie could not have been made under the code. Well, he could have made, but it would be an entirely different story. Thanks goodness to the code has not been respected until 1934. Otherwise, we would miss out on this gem.
