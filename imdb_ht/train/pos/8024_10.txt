When I first saw this film in the 1980s, I was among my teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since I consider myself growing up and out of the "Sezam Street / Muppets" age. I honestly do not remember if I liked it at the moment or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this movie again, and was wound away (and stayed) in my best movie ever collections. <br /> This is filmed with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would expect from the Muppets. I mean, obviously, Muppets still appeal to adults and children because there is humor adapted towards both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally heard that someone says "I do not take my clothes for anyone, even if it is artistic" ... has a joke from a father of a son that if child The man in love with the Kermit Frog then the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo saves a chicken and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (Sp?) and then says "I think we're engaging now" ... these and many other moments in the movie were me rolling. Added to this highly intelligent, very clever New York / Broadway "wink wink" humor dialogue, the usual large number of celebrity cameras and some really enjoyable songs that are not borders on "cheesy-level cheesy" ... this movie is a chief! I do not throw "10" out on a regular basis ... but one deserves it. Over 20 years later, this film is totally caught, perhaps even more so. The Muppets are never and will never again, as funny and smart and just plain glossy like this movie was and is. --- Q
