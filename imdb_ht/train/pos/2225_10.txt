I completely shocked that this show was canceled. It only lasted a year. I just recently started watching her and I loved it. It's a show that could go as far as Friends went. It had the humor and it was very enjoyable. <br /> It's about 2 brothers and sisters living under one roof without their parents.Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the bigger part of the sibling and takes on the role of more father. /> This should have lasted more than years as it was fantastic. Amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
