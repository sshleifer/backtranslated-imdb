As I said at the top, four stars just are not enough. It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my nearly 17 years of life. For those who do not really like it or understand it, you do not have to have a real appreciation for art or you can have a short span of attention. Even though I have not seen her movie anymore, I should say that this is Spielberg in his picks. It is very sad to see that such films as the "Purple" do not come together too often cause me to think that all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture movement in these difficult times. <br /> <Movies like this is more than just movie; They are pieces of art that need to be appreciated more. <br /> The idea that he was nominated for 11 Oscars (even better photos of the Year) and did not get one Trophy is a sign of blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg was not even named for Best Director! It should sweep the Oscars this year. The movie shows clearly how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only movies are still good.
