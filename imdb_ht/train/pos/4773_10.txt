Lovely piece of good movies. This is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why. Well, one of the reasons may be that we are facing one of the most surprising directors today, and it is able to film emotions. When watching the movie you can feel what Mr. Straight felt when he made the decision to go to visit his brother and "Wonderful" John Deere. What changed in itself?, Which changes to yourself when you watch this movie? <br /> A wonderful fraternal love story.
