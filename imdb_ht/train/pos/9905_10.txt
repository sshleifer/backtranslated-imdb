I lost count of how many reviews I wrote about Slaughter High. I read a lot of people who are bad and I'll say now this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for well-known suicide, and though this was his only movie, it is what made the movie so great. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. Then I found out due to current web pages at www.IMDb.com held in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to humans, but his own real life certainly had the strenghths and weaknesses. He did a good job action, who can agree? I always wonder how she felt to show herself naked in a movie. They had to be extremely embarrassed to say at least. I saw this first movie when I was 12th in the sixth grade. I agree with some indications as the girl did not take a bath after someone was murdered, and that high school does not have bathtubs! I think Caroline Munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignity acting dignity, and unfortunately for Simon's death he did not make any movie in the future. The reason (s) for suicide is a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. Doing the math on page page tells you she was 29 years old when she was massacred. It looked like a teenager. I gave this movie two thumbs, the best movie film was made. Probably because they are terrible to act other people did not make fame in the movie business. -Jakob Young
