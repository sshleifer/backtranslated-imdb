"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous slasher flick on a high school marty nerd Marty, who gets picked on all the time by some pranksters. The fuck goes wrong and ends up getting burning violence. Few years later fears it all goes to a reunion - just ten of them of course, and low and watch Marty killing them one after another.British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") drives the cast as the heroine (who died anyway! ) The act is completely awful, there's also no suspense at all.Plenty Grotesque death scene meets the gore-freaks: exploding a guy in explosion, another female victim literally gets an acid bath, a couple having the sex Beds get electrocuted, a guy is crushed by a tractor, a girl is drowned, and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye.The killer puts a decent mask and rather the climb and the environment (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice.However the dream dream is absolutely the pathetic.All All of it is true that "high kill" is a piece of waste, but I liked it. Only for fans of really silly flash slasher.
