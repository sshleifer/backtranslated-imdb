If you are such a big fan of a author as I am in Jim Thompson, it can be very dodgy when the works are converted into films. This is not the case with Scott Foley's pronouncement after my DARK SWEET. A suspicious, classic classic noir that closely follows and performs great justice in the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward provide the best performances in their careers. And always Bruce Dern's phenomenon can be even on himself and this one. As Thompson's book this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion winning logic and double cross is never far away. A must see for all fans of big movie noir. **** !!!
