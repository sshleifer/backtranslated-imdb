This is simply a classic movie where the human voice from the animals is really what they are thinking of. I do not know if my video copy has a missing scene, but it never shows how the dogs were out of the pit. It also shows an animal survival instinct and tracking ability. But people in the same position between helicopters should come out. For once an original movie improved by a rumor as the voice-on for the first was removed. Only use animals to work in a movie of this type because using people who would have had to spice out the story does not turn it into murder, prove that, after all, the animals are more interesting than humans
