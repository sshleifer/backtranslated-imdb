Well, this might be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-of-force performance! Alas, his career is never good, but - at last - it will still be remembered for his three first-rate photographs: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll", and "Without You I Am Not". It donates to different people from New York Social Ross Diana to create a bitter and hilarious criticism of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, sensitive and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she persuades the audience at every stage, and it is actually "really nice". Watch this one (if not from Iowa), you will certainly enjoy it !!
