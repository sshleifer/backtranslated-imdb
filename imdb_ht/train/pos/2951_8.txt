Yeah, it's a chick movie chick and it moves a bit slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I think myself a wrong man. You must love Judy Davis, no matter what she's in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery in small coastal summer slots is beautiful and plays well with the great theme of the movie. The sex (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism in the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention. In general, I give it an 8/10. Go see it.
