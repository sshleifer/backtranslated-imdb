I talked and devastated after my first look at this - many parts of the GRAY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary in by, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for the money in the weirdsville violets. I have focused on how these women (which are clinical ways beyond unique) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising way, and I wonder if their withdrawal of the world was prompted by something beyond the straightening of life in the real bloodless universe, maybe some abuse, or perhaps simply a trace of challenge and rebellion that spirals out of control and take on a life of 'its own. This could be one of the biggest movie ever that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do things, I kept anything like the empty gems bottles in the room Debris-strewn, cats urinate on beds, emerging raccoons from the walls of the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - as a child's birthday party went badly. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
