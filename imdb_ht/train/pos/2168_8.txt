I saw this film on television late a night ago, but it was a disturbing experience that stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The situation may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake, an underground underground shop in a toxic nervous agent in the hills above a small town is breached, with a microscopic amount of the substance find its way into food supply. Residents of the city begin to lose their ability to exercise constraints on all the desires and bases that float in our minds from time to time, and that we normally know that we simply do not have to act on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! There are several sincere and very quiet candies that have been engraved in my memory all the time. <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we all can be if we were given in our most feral instincts. Did I like it? I'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. Does it make me think? Definitely. I always think about it. Scary stuff.
