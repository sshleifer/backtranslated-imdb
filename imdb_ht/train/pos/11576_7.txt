It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. With a cast like Sho Kasugi, Christopher Lee and Jan-Rhys Davies he really is the B-B adventure of all time. It's actually a nice fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for those who did it. Though he did in the 90s, he does not have a modern feel. It further has the same feeling that an old Errol Flynn film has. Big Adventure Movie are still great things in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling of them will never be similar to those old movies. That's the other hand, just have the real feeling. You just can not hate it. I think it's an adventure adventure movie. And I really love the band. Unfortunately, I want to sing in the theme.
