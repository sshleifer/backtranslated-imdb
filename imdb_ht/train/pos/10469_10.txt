I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993. I was 8 at the time, and now at the age of 22 it feels unusual to have seen this show show and end up looking at it.The All 90 of a sudden seem so far, what a great decade. Anyway I used to watch MonsterVision all the time, as I'm a big fan of monster cops and horror movies. It was like the 90's version of Chiller Theater. If MST3K can find the DVD why not show Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. A lot of Joe Bob's comments and info about these films were just hilarious. Most movies are shown on the show being B or C classes but showed a lot of a home movie as well as the Hammer films from England that are top tooth as well as many and the motionless magic stop at Ray Harryhausen. Many have been oddball flicks that you would not see anywhere else like the Japanese Sci-Fi movies exclusive to Godzilla Course that is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like Metal Storm and Hell Motel. With the new decade of film preservation and independent self-directing director, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC collecting, since they already have a hit and show the IFC Ild House. I'm sure this show will be picked up again for a few nostalgia reasons, I guess will have to wait and see. Until then, "this Great TV"!
