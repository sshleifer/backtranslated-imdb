Even though the shining is about a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone who does not get leaps out of Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one could rip it off; instead it was time reference and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, crazy the story "write" ... this should be seen, if for nothing else, they understand all the hints of it in everyday life. The movie is simultaneously scary, thrilling, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It had the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the horror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually miss: a great script.
