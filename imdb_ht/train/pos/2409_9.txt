This film has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to those who are looking for temporary and cultural loyalty, but it challenges the overseer to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, is Jesus' humanity. Christ's tension-related relationship is developed and made in the film. Today 'passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judah takes his own life, the viewer can feel the bitterness. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerful as the drama of Judah. Chris Sarandon offers a novel novel and provocative, whether credible or not. I would like to get this movie on DVD or even VHS, for use in study or discussion groups.
