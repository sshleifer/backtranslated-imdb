If you did not see this dark little chic, you should seek it out. It is the story of a bumbling, during the Sad Sack War (Fred MacMurray) who listed 4-F every time he attempts to join any branch of the military. It finds a magic lamp that's of course having a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending it at all times to serve at all times the wrong and wherever it wants. She is beautiful, happy, and too pure, and you can not help but love her. The plots are very much like a Disney movie, particularly since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) have also made many Disney films in the 50's and 60's, although not together. Needless to say, it all ends well for everyone, and the viewer goes far fragrant.
