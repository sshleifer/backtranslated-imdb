really excellent film, one of the best I've seen. Touch and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes laugh and it's just nice. Not too much of anything, as it is supposed to be. Really like the idea of ​​the movie, noone is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes making mistakes mainly because of the pressures of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you Do not have the reason to upset - you can do it, but eventually the anger goes away and then you need to let love back in although it's hard, there lies the happiest happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actor and cast, the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful beautiful beauties. <br /> <br /> I recommend to see it, especially if you like to see the Italian life.
