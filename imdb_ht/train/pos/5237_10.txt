We all create our own reality, or are we? This is the basic question behind this very original quiz and masterfully fabricated in the illusion nature of reality. Mixing Eastern Philosophy and Buddhist Philosophy and Visual Censorship of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatment manages to take on the rather cerebral question of 'Who are we and what is our place in the universe?', And it turns it into a fascinating and fun-filled 100 minutes. The film movie about Bart, a writer with difficulty with his scenario, `The Sea Thoughts. ' As he sat down at his computer, the work began unfolding as nothing more than a description of his sitting in the computer, writes the scenario. Before long it is stuck in a whirling concern in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a sense of impotence in humor and spell the visualizer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and the validity of our perception. Finally, the film Graaff challenged the audience at various levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or if our whole understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses.
