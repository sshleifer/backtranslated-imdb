If you find yourself in need of escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and allow you to lose in another world, Domino will meet that need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like Usual suspect) where you want to see it a second time face it all out. I am surprised at Domino Harvey himself, how his life came to Hollywood's interest. As for the act, many celebrity appearances are not shown in the trailers. And any actor who made me forget who they did their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or costume costume. And thanks, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, it shows the signs were able to take care of others.
