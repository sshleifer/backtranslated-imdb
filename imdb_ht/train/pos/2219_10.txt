This film was a fascinating look at Krey√≤l Creole and society that some African Americans are aware of. My own children are not produced by a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of jens of colorful hairstyles and a black skinny woman whose parents were ex-slaves. He was married outside with his culture and was cut off from all of his family except a sister who had pity on his brother's stroke; increased 8 children during major depression of 1929; Give the family food every time he or she could. Of course it klandestinely help this family to fear its own old communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it a part of our libraries.
