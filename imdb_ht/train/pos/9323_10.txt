For me this movie was powerful. I do not want to be a stoker, but I had a friend years ago; We were like brothers. This movie brought some vivid memories. For some reason, I could not put my vote for this movie that was a 10th. I kept a message like "No vote was put." But I saw in the stats that there was . Will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> My minor defect is neglected. It was the relationship between the characters who got me. Very well acted with real situations. I was in a couple of them. <br /> A small gem in a movie. Just like "Forward Forward" is another gem neglected. I'm very pleased with movies like these are still being done; on relationships between people, well written, sensitivity unfolded with first-class acting and direction. After all, is not that what it all about?
