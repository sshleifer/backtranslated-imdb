This is one of the most cynical fun cinemas ever! <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but still enjoy watching her outfit "like super cool" and a "like totally bitchin" belt and stick on her face. <br /> But anyways, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that keep your interest. I know that the drag begins, particuarly if you know what will happen, but the second half is probably one of the most wracking nerves in a family movie. <br /> I would not stand in front of the millions of people and proclaim this movie love, in fact renting it is very embarrassing itself, but I'll admit it here with the internet hidden behind.
