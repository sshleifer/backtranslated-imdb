Rarely we see such short comments written by IMFb filmgoers. Maybe it's because this lightweight black comedy is fun and fun without depth, or we miss something? I would watch it again if I had some incentive. <br /> So what is a destination? For the French is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps it's an event that is accumulation in a series of these random. We've all had these (so-called life) but when looking at this way, you begin to get the feeling that "random" can be more like "unfortunate." This film might be an incident as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce in the back of a truck or as bigger as based on a larger life decision on the accuracy of a stranger throwing a pebble. All these incidents cause other events ... well do you find the picture? Domino. Multiply these by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to truly stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario can happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. But then this is the magic world of movies. <br /> <br /> We admit that it is fun to watch the writer's / tram directors along these events relating to a story that enmeshes the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a capricious escape, here's the place to do it. Or if you're recovering from surgery and will not be anywhere anyway, this will engage you while your point is healing. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not go down as a premium winner but it should develop a cult following. The strange things happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is attributed to the following: "Life can be understood only backward, but it must live ahead." If you look at the many details of your own life experience (your first love meeting, get the perfect gift, your latest auto accident) you would get a series of seemingly random events that lead up to it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring together an explanation for explaining "Happenstance" for me.
