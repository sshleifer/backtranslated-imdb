Having a fan of Columbo, I was sorely disappointed in 'Corky Romano'. While certainly a comic movie, Falk's character boss boss was a far cry from the lovable Lieutenant he played for many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After 'Corky Romano', I was honestly both surprised and soured by Mr. Peter Falk. However, he just saw 'Get Jan Christmas' and his predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time in a week in each other, I said that 'Max', Peter's Falk's delightful character Both movies, is surely as memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'. While parts of the film are quite predictable, these scenes in no way take away the pleasure of seeing the story played out. I also wish I had recorded both of these happy Christmas cinemas, and I highly recommend them if you are a Falk fan, a Christmas Christmas, or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of week in. This movie can end up losing among the crowds of make-for-TV holiday cops, so make sure you get 'Get John Christmas' before it's too late.
