I was lucky enough to catch this movie finally on Turner Classic movie tonight, as it is one of the films that won an Oscar (for special effects) in the annual film of Oscar Movie. <br /> <br /> BEDKNOBS and BROOMSTICKS is an easy end to the film for the earliest success of Mary Poppins. That film too was a great success, and an Oscar winner (Best Actress for Julie Andrews). Like Mary Poppins BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in her, in a role where she learns about parenting. It's a fine mix of live action and animation. It is set in a past period of British history (if not the Edwardian - Georgian world in 1912 London, it is the England coastline during the "Dunkirk" summer of 1940). She even has old Reginald Owen in her, here as a General at the Home Guard, whereas her former was the Admiral Boom of Mary Poppins. Ironically it was Owen's final role. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The period also suggests that the appearance of three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings of the Blitz in London. And (in typical Disney fashion) in the "Portobello Road" music number different members of the British Army (including soldiers from India and the Caribbean (complete with metal drums again!)) Appeared with Scottish and local subsidiaries in costumes. /> <br /> Everyone, surprisingly, is a plus. But the biggest thing is that for Angela Lansbury, her performance as Eglantine Price is finally reading: her single pure plastic music lead. In an importantly active career, Lansbury has never had a real career career as a Mime Award at MAME in music that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did. She was in song party (at GASLIGHT and briefed her in a BALLOON boy, and in the GRAY GRAY picture with little yellow girl, and - the best of all - in support and conclusion of the girls vibrations and The ultimate excuse of ATTENTION, TOPEKA, AND SANTA FE). But only here she plays the female lead. So when you hear his song with David Tomlinson you can understand what we lost when he did not play Mame Dennis Burnside. <br /> <br /> The rest of the throw is very good, Tomlinson here learns that he can ride on the occasion after a life of relative failure. Three children (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Weighill) actually show the most interesting places of their character than the Edwardian predecessors of POPPINS (Weigh in particular, as something of a thoughtful opportunistic thinking of blackmail Lansbury after finding it is a witch). The only surprising desire (possibly due to cuts in scene) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the movie. With its possible role as a dangerous enemy of magic it should be a bigger part. Also in note is John Ericson, as the German officer that led an attack to the conclusion of the film, only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British, and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are looking for. <br /> As for the animation, the sequences are under the sea in a lagoon, and in the driver of the driver ever drawn to the well worth seeing, and Tomlinson pulls in the letter as the referee, and gets nice seriously bang up in various loads and scrimmages. As I said it is a wonderful sample of Disney's best work studio.
