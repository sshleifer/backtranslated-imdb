The Oscar 2004 Candidate is a very short film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a coffee shop, gets a coffee, and remarks a couple of singers standing silently with the instruments. All customers are immobile, like mannequins. A guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks in a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning. There is a moment of surprise after another to the end that is well, quite, surprising. People, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. And like pieces of music "Bolero", the thing keeps building until the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and wit, it is a 8 minute masterpiece.
