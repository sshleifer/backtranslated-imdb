Well I do not personally love rap, but I always find fear in a Black Hat Anything. I'm sure I did not get some jokes inside, but some I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of spinal pipes, so naturally I checked this out. It was deriviatif in This is Spinal Tack, sometimes blatant, but this movie still stands on its own as an original, intelligent, and funny satire. My personal favorite: "Back in time of slavery, they did not have their hatred against the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to rebellion."
