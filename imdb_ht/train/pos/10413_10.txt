I grew up with this as my favorite movie ever. Special incredible effects for the era, and won prizes. I can remember the dialogue as if I would hear it yesterday. It is simply a great, timeless adventure. The music is not Miklos Rosza, who is the best movie theater. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the Grand Master. I have a copy of arrival, for the next trip down memory line. Where there is! Rex Ingram wants to get out of her bottle!
