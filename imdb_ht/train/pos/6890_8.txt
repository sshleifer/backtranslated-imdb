This was one of the highlights of the ST: semi-forgettable second round of the TNG, before being 'grew up' or grew up in their own in the third and farther season. This was not just a showcase for up-and-coming such as Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but he was also continuing to search the data for his 'humanity', the time of the concept of comedy. Always one of my favorite episodes. In one side note, I'm always disappointed that there is no credit for the actress and Okona's character on being sad (after Teri Hatcher's character) before being cut off by Lt Worf. I remember watching this 'first-run' episode of my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought it would have been a perfect Jean Gray / surprised girl. <br /> It would be good to know who this beautiful lady actually is ...
