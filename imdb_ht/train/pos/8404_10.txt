Simple-minded but good-natured drive-in film on a simple-minded graduate, but good-genuine features that dream of owning the custom windmill in the world are used as his "ballet". Bobby, our hero, spends his entire economy to get the vehicle in his dreams. Joint sharing and love to do quickly start with Bobby girl being picked up at the local pizza salon, but it has many responsibilities, dangers and grief coming up with being the owner of such a mechanic. is a pleasure to be guilty of me. It captures the late mid-70's mood and humorously unwittingly puts it in its "bad bad" category.
