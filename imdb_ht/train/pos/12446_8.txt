Having heard of Modesty Blaise before, but never having read a novel or comic strip, my wife and I loved the movie very much. It delivers, in a fascinating way, a good introduction to the character and background. Although it has some flickering action elements, it is more an intimate, excellent writing. Unfortunately, this is also, where a great disadvantage of the movie is revealed. An intimate play lives on the abilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the throw. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Blaise Modesty, his counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the wicked Miklos - was not. Smiling his way into the plot as if it is a commercial toothpaste, he failed to build an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece. Thrust in support is somehow the same, from stereotyped gangsters and decent performance scenes from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
