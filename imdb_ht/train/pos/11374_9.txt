There are some excellent comments and observations about this movie. I was happy to remember the comparisons of Fritz Lang's "M" (remembering the 50th Anniversary and Lightweight David Wayne absences). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinary fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking her sexually frustrated anger on her victims - especially the children. It is the goal. The real villain is the system of bureaucratic Soviet enthusiasm, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. Frustration of a dedicated man (Rea's best role since the "crying game"), an easy pragmatist who wants to use the system to benefit from it (Sutherland is still successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, scary but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), bumbling, boopous bureaucrat to a prosecutor (brilliant British actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting the wife of the investigator driving (delightful supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one movie film fine. Its darkness and weakness are supported by the painting of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to dip into the stunning Gore-Laden 'bone that is characterized by many recent films. Gore is present - it's a horrible story - but it adds to the description of a pathologically twisted human. The success of the story is precisely that: these are the acts of someone, like someone like you or I. Where you and I choose to prevent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo has taken away his anger from the innocent most and vulnerable to us, our children. The superb site of this story is made manifest by an excellent superb cast of excellent actors. - At all times, I remember that our Australian friends did not like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speak in Australian Aussie. Well, too bad. This fine film sure worked for me and everyone I talked to with people who saw it.
