Due to the invention of a "domestic collar", meat-meat zombies are brought under control, and become productive members of society; However, they do work threatening. The dandruff dead goes to people living in fenced US 1950s-styled small towns, while without zombie stain roaming around in the "Wildlife Area". In Willard City, Pre-Teen K'Sun Ray (like Timmy Robinson) lives with Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker parents (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, Robinsons are the only family in the streets that do not own a zombie; New neighbors, under them, have six. So they keep up, Robinsons get zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Necklace" is damaged by the old lady Walker, and he ate it; Then the new and hungry zombie infest city. Meanwhile, Young Ray grew up with Connolly (the boy and his zombie as the TV "Timmy and Lassie"), and the Robinson family found it difficult to cooperate with the "Zomcom" authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far into its own intriguing "Wildlife Zones"; But it is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly addictive movie satirical film. Ray and cast in doing well, individually; and Nubile Zombies Sonja Bennett (like Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (like Theopolis) are the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music), and James Willcock (design), deserve award winning. * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
