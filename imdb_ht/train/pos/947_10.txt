and possibly closer to the Dickens story line. Although I find young Ebenezer hard to look (that's idea was that hair period, surely they could do better than that!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. Delivering it to some of the lines from Dickens finally brought it to life for me. Edward Woodward is all we expect and more of the Holy Spirit at Christmas present. I found G.C. Scrooge Scott is more of a miserable credible than the more version now made by Patrick Stewart. The morning scene scene when Scrooge realized he was not 'missed', is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act against overact. It is phenomenal here. Almost thrown at all is incredible. Ti Tim in this version of Carol Christmas is a little hard to look at, almost too sweet. Always the music and the landscape make this a must look everyday. Enjoy!
