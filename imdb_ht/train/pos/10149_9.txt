A sweet silly story of 2 people crosses the way as they prepare for their wedding. The former newspaper extract and public school teacher dropped to each other in New York's big new environment, though they were married. Maybe a little in that the "partners" are both a type of personality, while our protagonists are more relaxed. Not heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the natasha henstridge angle, and the gals - sell the santa romance, everyone wins!
