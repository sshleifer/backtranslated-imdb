At one level, this film can bring the child to you who just wants to build sandcastles and send things in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again. On a deeper level though, he explores a deep desire to reconnect with the country. I'm well empathized with the artist when he says, "when I'm not out here (alone) for any amount of time, I feel uprooted." <br /> I consider Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. I'm familiar with her work mostly in her coffee-table book and a couple art gallery setup. But to see his work in motion, was captured perfectly in the Riedelsheimer lens, was a revelation. Chaos in time, the creation of Goldsworthy comes alive, whirl, fly, dissolve, crumbling, crashing. So what's precisely what it's all about: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Appearance and disappear. In coming out of the empty and becoming the universe, and back again. Has a shamanic quality on it, jumping on madness. You get the feeling, watching him at work, that his art is a life for him, that if he did not do it, he would be whoever perished. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision of photography communication. Otherwise, with the exception of a few seams and walls, they would only exist for one person.
