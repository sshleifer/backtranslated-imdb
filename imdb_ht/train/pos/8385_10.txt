This film seems to get bad critics for some reason. Probably just by the mass population. Anyhow, this is actually a very interesting movie. This film is a non-budget sci-fi film that is currently working, due to an exciting and well-performing scenario. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be for everyone though. If any of this sci-fi fan is reading, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The environment includes nations that will make war with GIGANTIC cars that all countries are investing all its money! The world was divided up into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone else in a war, or rather, a 'robot-duel'. The war strategy is cleaner than nuclear wars, since now everyone is wearing their masks. Define a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, well written, and good effects for the budget measurements. I tend to like movies with little budget and actually work.
