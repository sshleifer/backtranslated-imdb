Being a night list of the Dead Life at the top three of her five favorite movies ever, and at the same time love to parody this movie, I feel I must defend that movie The review reviews have already posted evolution. This short but sweet opus was still a crowd-pleaser of horror and science fiction movie marathon where people go to have a love in the genre yet know they do not take zombie movie too seriously. This movie is a tribute to the original, not a reproach. It must be funny, and many others who have heard the song and applaud he agrees with me that he succeeds. Especially for those of you who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Look for the camera director as news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity to catch his alien parody, Loaf.
