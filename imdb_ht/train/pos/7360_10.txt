wow! this is a good movie! The act was not good at all, but if you look at some moments in the movie, delayed and watch it again, it is genius! The man at the beginning of the movie market with his suitcase against a three. WOW! I never expected that. Then put the coke in a suitcase and run away. I bet that guy smokes against that three was one of his comrades who sold the drugs later. And genius quotes: 'All beautiful, I need a' '' fear of you .. if you think you can take them. '' Just Brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen in a while. Looking at the second guy he took down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT IS A HIT! And among the movie, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fell, it is really good at aiming. He listened to a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so interesting that james cahill walked 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shot peter jerk after his distraction movement. Jason Peters falls down, rolling over again while he dies! I can not say with more words how great this movie is!
