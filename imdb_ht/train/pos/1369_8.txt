I liked this movie, and I'm one of the older ones who do not supposed to enjoy it, or so it looks. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These types of movies are never. But strange, there is a message in it. It is that each of us has the potential to be whatever we want. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought it brought some physical resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey have made movies on librarian (Hepburn is set to office). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see the girl's party. <br /> I gave this movie an 8. It is by no means a huge movie by Cinematic standards, although there are some nice shots in it. But it is incredibly good and fun.
