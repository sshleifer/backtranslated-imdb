I have to mention two failures for you to understand that this film is spotted where it fails: "A Slow Scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt terrible shame (like me), you'll probably enjoy Renaissance. It plunges you into the world of a future Paris. It's not quite dystopic. The animation was well done as I thought it was rotoscoped, but in what I can say, it was not, it was simply moving capture. The facial expressions are amazing! Not since TRON I have seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animated / hybrid live. Black and white medium is used slowly to direct attention to the scene; My favorite effects were what they did with light light, look for it. The director plays with your attention and confusion but you eventually meet by finding the thread that he wants you to get. The overall effect is a harsh and courageous urban world filled with small surprises. The draw is high, but it's not terrible. It is noir-me. There is a backstory for most of the major characters to give some depth. There is bad weather. There are "together" so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There are some actions, and even a chase machine. I'll have to see this one again to find everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see it as "together" to detail and credit is small.
