If anyone is interested in proposing a copy of this video MAKING IT DESCRIPTION: First telecast by CBS on November 30, 2003, made-to-television that finds John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year's A San are not Christmas, and Peter Falk darts his role as Max Max Max versatile Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a small town with depression ... about the fact that ER in his hospital kept up being forced to close because of a $ 100,000 debt shortly arose when he spotted a photo taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The photo shows a courageous action taken by Hank Fireman Noah (William Russ), who is mysterious to leave 25 years ago and have not seen it. Hank would like to slowly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proved impossible when Noya's newspaper a $ 50,000 reward was identified to Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there is something, very, very curious about this picture: It also shows a Santa Claus seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That's elusive "Santa" is in the course of the angelic max, who pops up now and again throughout the story of a variety of issues resolving problems, dispensing tips, tied up loose release droplets - and even share a well-crafted music with Kathleen's grandson Socorro (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> INTERESTED in a copy: write me here: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
