Very beautifully made with a wonderful performance from Gretchen Moll capturing such an early plain happiness in her work, and the recreation of the little movies and the photos are perfectly made and often hilarious. According to Harron, film stocks that have no longer produced and fifty studio lighting scenes even for their outdoors give the different colors of their different look. Bettie Page has seen the film at home Hugh Heffner (it is now eighty-three) and the producers there, but not the director, in case it was left if he did not like it. He apparently loved it until the official investigation, which he found unsettling. There are also some great costumes. The idea for the film began in 1993, but that was worth the wait. The portrait of it never seems to be false in reference to all those images and cuts in many frozen movies we will already see. It would make an interesting companion piece with Goodnight and Goodluck, but look more beautiful!
