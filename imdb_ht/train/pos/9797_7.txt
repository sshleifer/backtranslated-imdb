Batman: Mystery of Batwoman is the latest Batman animated video / DVD movie to be released. (Minor Spoilers front) The plot turns into a new crimefighter, the Batwoman, which seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, to stand up a major shipment arm. not as good as the 'Mask of the Phantasm,' 'Sub-Zero,' or 'Return to the Joker.' The main reason is that it does not give on the emotional appeal the other films made. At the end of this film, we do not really feel sorry for anyone as we did in others, especially, 'Sub-zero'. There is no real tragedy that has made other animated movies for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a 'tragic character' (like Mr. Frozen or Phantasm). Not only that but the baton changing looks so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer does not really care what happened to him that caused him to put on the mask or what happens to him at the end and with it the main reason we do not get this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I did get the movie enjoyable. It has its moments, such as when the audience finds out that Batwoman really is and sees a backward return that last seen in the original 'Batman: The Animated Series.' The action is also very enjoyable with some suspense moments. If Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would be better than 'Return to the Joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's 4th (out of 4). As for the animation, it's the same as Batman's New Adventures cartoon from the middle of the 1990's. The score is not as memorable as before the 3 animated film Batman, but it's still good to be. <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But just remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies. <br /> 7/10
