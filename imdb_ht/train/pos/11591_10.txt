I've also been looking for this movie for some time, and how great it would get it on DVD ... I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed by it. He showed up before Walt Disney's BOOK BOOK! <br /> What I remember in this movie is fragmented. I remember that an American boy was a friend of an eagle. This impresses me so much. For some reason he was cast out of his village (did not understand the reason for this). When the other boys cast stones at him, he climbed a rock and flew. Then he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friends. As an eagle he always carries his turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
