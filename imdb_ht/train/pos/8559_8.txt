There is a certain genius behind this film. I laughed at all. The scene of the telephone sex office, discussing how lover doppelganger's healing was a beautiful attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the message writer and have some talent. The doubleganger split into the end was like ... "ok, did not quite wait but let's see what the movie said". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet and actually very coherent idea of ​​the story in a strange way. Is it point in a movie to be logical or is it to be fun or communicate on an emotional level? I'm easily bored by many movies, but this one has kept my interest at all. <br /> I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Horribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other people's movies (with more experience).
