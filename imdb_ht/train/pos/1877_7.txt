Arthur Bach is unhappy with his life as a multi-millionaire and attracts people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attractive to a shoplifter. /> He drinks quite a lot, and sometimes it drives while drinking, too, which of course is not funny, ever. The movie is great but behind the comedy is some fact, too. Jan Gielgud wet the floor and everyone else on screen and create a character for their age. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have moments, but their Gielgud as "Hobson" you will remember the most.
