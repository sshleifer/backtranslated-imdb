The story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line. He decided to make the trip on his lawn as he can not drive and he wants to make the rip alone. The film beautifully painted his journey and the lives he touched on the road. Richard Farnsworth turned into a beautiful performance like making the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely critical role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country would be dull, but I soon discovered that Lynch and all the insights in life have made that a movie I would recommend for anyone.
