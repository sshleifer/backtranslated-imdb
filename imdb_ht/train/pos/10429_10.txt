I'm not usually a fan of cinematic prohibited movies but hearing was good. I was stunned. The most amusing thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is impeccable as it is written and directed. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. <br /> <br /> These films will grab you right away and not let go. You can not look far away or you can stop them. Even moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This was flying in the ranks of one of my favorite ever. A masterpiece.
