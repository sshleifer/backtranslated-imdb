Show this is wonderful. It has some of the best writing I've ever seen. She was brilliantly led by Dvid Trainer who also headed another smart TV series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> This show is and out a thought one of the greatest. Like the three companies, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBY show this will be on TV for a long time to come. From it to perfectly manufacture the great performance jokes you would only dream this is a wonderful show for those who lived in the Seventies and those who did not. This show appeals to the youth and the gene in heart. A perfect show.
