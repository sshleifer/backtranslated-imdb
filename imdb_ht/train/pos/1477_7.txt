I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (which I talked to my mom's mother at law at the same time). Who can tell me what happened to him? I looked a little bit that her husband had heard someone talk to his wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, he had died already .. What happened to him? Has he killed himself? How can she arrange everything like phone calls, meanwhile she's at home when her husband talked to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain to me, please. I'm so curious !! (in the end, I read that she suffered from multiple personality disorders). <br /> <br /> <br /> Thnks before.
