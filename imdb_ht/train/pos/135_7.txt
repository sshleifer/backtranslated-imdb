It was an excellent piece of the puppet series because this movie has shown all the series, from one to seven. And then about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would never guess that the puppets should be in pain. Plus she showed some of the bridegroom series that I did not see and what she saw was so bad as part of. She has shown an appearance of torch that can turn things and people, which is cool, and has shown the return of the puppet master from one party. He also showed little aliens from part 4 that was cool, and showed others episodes that would be good and he did. So thanks to this puppet master there will be a big hit.
