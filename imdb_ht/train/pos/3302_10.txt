Perhaps the most polished and accomplished in all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps often associated with Bollywood films (ie tackiness, mascara, imitation wholesale and unsuccessful films in west / west films). Pakeezah is indigenous to the sub-continent and native, almost Mrs. Butterfly-like in plot. Characters are well-developed, directional, although sometimes bullied by today's standards, perceptions and convictions. Spouses who speak English in the time of Pakeezah are masters of understatement and how the dialogue translates the intricacies of the age! The act (particularly 'alike' and dynamic between the characters) is a pleasure to see although the nuances can be lost on contemporary viewers or those who do not know with the dead and customs of Muslim India. , and a captivating scenario is a wonderful music note, reinforced by the protagonist showing the good order in classic Indian dance (kathak). As is the most romantic case with the most romantic tragedy, the heroine must die, but he does not take his leave to the audience without the viewer feeling he / she was part of a really memorable memory experience. Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what Indian movies has produced and is easy to be parallel.
