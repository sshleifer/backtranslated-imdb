I'm a 53-year old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The movie is original, witty, fast-paced and totally spacious. The plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles band was not as interesting as it should be. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing was excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I'm disappointed that professional critics (almost all adults) violence attack the movie. Apparently, they have something against movies that show strong, intelligent and independent young men. Write to reveal more about their own sexiest nature than anything about this wonderful family movie. I strongly recommend it to every child and parent.
