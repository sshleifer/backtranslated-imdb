Anyone who saw Mel Gibson in the Passion of Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would like to see this movie instead. Even if it was not a success in box box office or TV ratings, the Fox movie channel always found a real good motive to show this every year. I liked the way they incurred Chris Sarandon and the guys who showed his followers singing in Hebrew.And Sarandon did not have long hair like any other Jesus would be in other films, seems to be very close to what a Jews would appear. What surprised me or my wonder was the stage where Caiaphus told Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Even though this was not a racist remarks, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the important people in those days. Keith Michell's painting of Pilates was hulking, compared to his previous performance in "History in Jacob and Joseph "and" David's History ". But if you compare his paintings to Pilates with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really painted the impression of a Roman procurer.
