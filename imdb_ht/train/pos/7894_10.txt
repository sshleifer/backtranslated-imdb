This is a great show, and will make you cry, this group really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again. Email me and let them chat. I was in Australia and they really talk like this. <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and pass on the great stories of right and wrong, and the friendship of your kids. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have collected over the past 5 years. See five Mile Creek taxes at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extended theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> These people are so cool!
