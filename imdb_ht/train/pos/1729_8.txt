In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape a POW camp using a Gymnastic Horse Vaulting in the yard. In 1950, she decided to film herself, and she kicked-started a peculiar British Film Genre- The Military Prison Camp that had reached its apogee at the Danger (1959). <br /> <br /> The wooden horse is one of the quiet films I've ever watched. There is no great dramatic moment, but a fixed storytelling eventually builds in a tighter point with more tension because the story does not give way to drama drama, jump off or jacked up (maybe on happen!) Music. It is absolutely in its time and it works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously cast key to extra expenses and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are still mono-tone and quiet. They hold emotions out of their roles. As many have, until recently, former service, I suspected to recreate the role of war time as 'officers and guys'. <br /> <br /> This unemotional approach does not detect any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most of the era films, the story does not end in wires: and this fact alone keeps me close to the end.
