This is a dramatic movie in the whole sense of the word. It says that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Ensure it has some extreme .. but every now and then real misery of unsurpassed art. It is deeply critical of our goal to pursue and to build all the social structures built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structures. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain fast-food mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular, but while watching it you feel that someone puts the words best possible and the picture describes your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music either but I would not like to hear anything else when she played during the movie. If someone told me to say something against this movie I would define the following, sometimes the transition between the scenes seemed suddenly or somewhat off. I guess the correction was to cut it to fit the 2hours and a bit for theaters .. <br /> Anyway I could write more and more to express my thoughts about this but I guess u have seen read and discuss it with a friend. A must see
