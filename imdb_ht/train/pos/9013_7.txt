Although this movie has some weakness, it is worth seeing. I chose it because of the cast, and applauded Bonham Carter and Branagh to choose different roles from what they had taken in the past. Both show people very troubled, filled with wars, but make them nimble because of humanity. The story is touching, but it is the performances that are soaring. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable success, with the demand for romance to open my eyes in the aspect of being disabled that I have not thought of before but was interesting as well for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too suddenly, but better than one emotionally manipulating design (see "Stepmom.") Creating the real English added to my pleasure - it was England in the 90's, both urban and rural, without being depressing.
