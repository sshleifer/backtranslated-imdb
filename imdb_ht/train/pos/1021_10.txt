The first and second season started off shakily, with the good episodes of sandwiches between these average, and in time resorted to cliche. But once he started setting up the universe in which he existed and began to develop his character more, he became a lot more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this success is because of four people: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's sweet sense of humor makes best show, directing Peter is excellent and makes any episode for more fun, and Joe & Paul never fail to make a funny, exciting episode. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, I doubt you will not like the show. For those who are getting to the show I suggest the 'other side' episodes, a good episode episode, and 'Windows Opportunity', a classic funny rescue episode.
