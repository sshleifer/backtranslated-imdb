This is a most beautiful movie. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the prodigality of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant colors. Other scenes indoors in various mansions, etc. are even brighter. As for the music, what more can be said than the voice of Lanza was in his peak as he sang many well known and beloved worlds. Dorothy Kirsten's wonderful is also a joy as his Soprano voice mixed with that of Lanza in delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took the ordinary freedom and the life story of Caruso. There are little precious in the story line with respect to current events. For example, reality-related deaths are totally crafted and do not bring any relation to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and have several photos of him. These websites can be located using any good search engine. There are also several books available on his life story. But the fictional story line does nothing to march this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten, and the choir members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy, I know that I'm sure you did.
