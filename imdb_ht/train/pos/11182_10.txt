I'm an impartial fan of most of the movies based on Stephen King's Book - this one percentage as one of the most hideous and most memorable. <br /> I've just finished retrieve it for about the tenth time and I still get it heart-wrenching as well as scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is on a crash collision course with the Monster Truck is one that stands out. And "There is no just" expressed by Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of shine. <br /> <br />
