Despite being told in a British perspective this is the best WW II documentary ever produced. Presented to digestible (such as digestible as wars can be) episodes as the severe voice of Laurence Olivier connects the crowd of witness witnesses who were forced to live their events in this awful time. Prior to awaiting his appearance on DVD in the United States, Europeans had the opportunity with a release of DVD earlier this year.
