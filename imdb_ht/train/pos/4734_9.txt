I'm a massive fan of Jet It! It is the best HK movie action movie star ... and consequently - This movie throws! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I did not register its first presence, and had to look twice. I immediately know what I would rent out. I'm just calm (I suppose I hope it) is that he's armed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. So the original plot / strange / cool movie, and full of action made it one of Jet Jet's best movies ... though they all fall under this category.
