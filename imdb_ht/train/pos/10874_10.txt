<br /> I must admit, I expected something quite different from my first look at 'cutting' last night, though they were happy with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I'm a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'Cut' not only the best of the genre of Australia ever produced but is one of the funny comedy parody / comedy late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Each possible cliche in the genre of horrors could. I'm sure this was intended as humor ... hope this was intended as humor. <br /> And of course, there was the gorilla. <br /> <br /> The use of the 'Customized' gardener shades was bright - besides the elbows expected and bar. In short, there was a large number of varieties and creativity of many violent, enough to please even the skeptics of this movie worth. <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short of his appearance) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the movie - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell (the 'Castle') in a brilliant role as jokey technician. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think this movie is one of the best supporting products in the past couple of years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-a-blow at the very end. <br /> <br /> Love it. Go see it!
