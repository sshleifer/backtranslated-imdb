If you "get it", it's magnificent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you were going through a school shooting. There are many more in this movie, at times, shooting the school become insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above, it's a movie about acceptance, both superficial - at a traumatic event, but also of those who are different for whatever reason. <br /> It is also a film about undesirable pain, and how different people keep it. In this case, contrast between Alicia's rage and Mania Deanna creates an atmosphere of anxious aspect that half of the film we ask how the director can possibly pull out a happy ending from his hat. Fortunately, the hearing is given to the human beings; Our intelligence is not insulted by a butcher, undesirable morally end. <br /> <br /> Above and beyond, I try to keep a clear head of the movie being fiction with all of this. But I must admit, I called as a baby lost during this movie. There were some things about it that knock * many * close to home and open up some old wounds that are never quite cured. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
