I love the story of the Holy Spirit. Good ghost story of bumps in the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I've seen many of them. As special efx has a grip ever on today's movie, some times find a real gem, you have to turn the timer back in the moment when the writers and directors really had to use themselves to create really good ghost stories. Now, this one, very rare, pilot episode for the Ghost TV series story called the "New House" was one of the most hideous films I've ever seen. It was about once in 1972, ... I was only 9, but nothing since then even compared to it. With all the renewal going to Hollywood, some people should make this one "as is" that does not have more efx more than the original. This episode has come down to hell as hell. I'm lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. Only the other 2 Stories of the Holy Ghost even came close ORIGINAL "Haunted" and George C. Scott of the "Changling". Wish someone would make more ghost stories like these.
