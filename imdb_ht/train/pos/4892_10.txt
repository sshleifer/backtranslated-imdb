This was a nice and clever movie that I never tired of watching many, many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young and the greatest characters. There are those of us from here who really do appreciate good actors and a smart story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful with a gift of any kind of production in which she stars. I still have a point to see Judi Dench in all of her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to look as every transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an exceptional picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently to miss good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film needs hero, not manicure, lacking intelligence and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this film win the prizes she deserves. Thanks again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I commend writers, directors, producers, and all those who have done such a good job.
