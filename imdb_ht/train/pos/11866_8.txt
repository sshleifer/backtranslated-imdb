Most people who saw this film think it is the best movie ever to do. I agree but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad ass guy and he knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead. It's about it and how it goes to wash dishes has a large house with an office of cocaine all over the office. If you want a family movie then this is not the way to go, but if you want mobsters and revenge with things like that then you'll love it.
