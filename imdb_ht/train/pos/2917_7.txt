While this movie is not a classic by any stretch, it's very fun as I remember it. I've seen it about 15 years ago on HBO and liked the movie. He was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur" and even though he's not as funny as that movie, he shows the potential that Steve Gordon arrives with "Arthur".
