This film was about last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of these films is almost never good (at least here on Mexican television), I could not change TV in la. The story about Madeleine Moore really touches you. It does not come across as a very sympathetic character at first, but sees the whole movie, you just want it to succeed. This movie really let you think. And I think basically due to the great act of Brooke Johnson. I have never heard of it before or known to see it in another movie, but this was great act. Congratulations Brooke. I hope to see her in another movie soon.
