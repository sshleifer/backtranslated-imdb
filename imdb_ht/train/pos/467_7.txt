This film is one of the good quality films in 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer of the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The photography of the movie is excellent as it acts in both Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely gives its best performance to date to prove it's worth much more than we thought. Watson also makes brighter. The story is about a phenomenon chess player (Turturro) which is also very unique in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with multiple recoveries from Luzhin's childhood. Through these, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> I have nothing more to say, but suggest this movie to anyone.
