Midnight cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful, and real but very fun. The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become actors Oscar have delivered amazing performances. Voight as hustler in Texas, Joe Buck, who migrated from Texas to New York City to become a hustler. It does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy. New York City women as rich women played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles different than Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck tries to escape from past lives in Texas. She has risen from her grandmother, Sally Buck, played by Ruth White's wonderful actress who died in 1969 from cancer. The locations in New York City are wonderful to watch as the relationship between Fatso is played by Hoffman and Buck's characters evolved into a male move to male friendship. The guys are struggling to survive New York City's life by playing by the rules like finding a real job. As the movie evolves, past the Buck comes to the surface and is haunted, but not clear. The film is not for children but compared to today's film and television programs, Midnight Cowboy might be more tame. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can not forget. It's also a tearjerker in a movie, so get your hips out too.
