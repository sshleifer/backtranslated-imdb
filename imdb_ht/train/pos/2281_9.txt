There are many films related to WW2, but Mom's Night is quite different among them: In this film, we are featured in Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth ( Lee), who decided to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent Big Wirtanen (Goodman) recruited Campbell who became a Nazi propaganda in order to enter into the highest dose of the Hitler regime. However, the deal is that the U.S. government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for national security purposes, and thus Campbell gets a hatred figure across the US. After the war she tries to hide her identity, but the past comes back with her couple. Only his "friend" is Wirtanen, but he can not do much so much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... <br /> The story is deeply touched, as we look at the tragedy in Campbell that although a great Patriots, treated by disdain not all who surround him. Not only that, but it also gradually realizes that even those closest to him, they have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, and Campbell's despair builds and almost chokes the viewer. Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; It is even better than in "affliction", although in both its roles play tragic figures that are destined to self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the entire cast in general. <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not figure out how the movie compared to it. In any case, this is something that does not matter here: my criticism is about the movie each is, and the whole movie deserves a 9/10.
