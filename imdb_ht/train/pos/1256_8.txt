This is a very dramatic and thrilling movie. There are plenty of plots and turns. The story or the principal opens the question mark on the death row or the alleged crime committed by black people. This film is well-directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this one, do not miss "VERY CRAY" or "HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
