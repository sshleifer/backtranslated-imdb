Let me make one thing clear .. For the most part, the mentality of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly p * sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much love, character Iconic from pages in comic books. Why? Well let's take a typical Hollywood board executive chart illustrating us to be .. .. <br /> Executive No.1 'Hey has a lot of money to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days.' <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'Good point, let's make one up and hurry then! ?? We'll make a chance dive into a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a movie over! '(The slumber takes place with a famous superhero name pulling out) <br /> <br /> Executive No.1' Great! Now who can we get to play the party? '<br /> <br /> Executive No.2' Who's a big box office desk at this time? ' <br /> <br /> Executive No.1 '* No great actor * is in this week's week.' <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'But Does It Really Cost The Role? I mean that it does not match the character too. '<br /> Executive No.1' Who cares? It's a great name; We'll make the movie with him in it anyway. ' <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'Well! And besides we'll fill the movie all so full of shock in the special glitzy effect tempered the morse mass that no one ever questioned anyway! The above scenario clearly shows one of the reasons why I'm generally upset by the modern superhero movie. All styles, no substance and simply tackling tackling of the iconic leads. Of course to be equitable, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood finds it right ?? take the casting of the original (and always easy to the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-men films. But back to the general negative characteristics posted by Hollywood today .. would not it be nice if our studio executives were in always choosing actors who actually adapt their roles? Well in this world's less ideal world, just one scenarios just believe it or not, by casting actors based on their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but typically) Hollywood did not like in yet allowing Collora to direct a film full length, but luckily, it gave us the tendency to what the end result would likely look like in the form of two (as in again) famous super character super hero. One of the superb Batman: Dead Ends and the other is this mock trailer for a whole movie artifact called World's finest. <br /> Well, let's not mince your words here ?? This is absolutely awesome thing! <br /> The casting of the winner of the Universe Mr. and Men's Model Michael O'Hearn, (which looked as awesome but was utterly wasted in the substandard barbarian) made for the most optimal choice playing the iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there was undoubtedly never had an approximation closer to the funny character. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram is cool back from his splendid paints like the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, yet another juicy piece is judged by casting! <br /> What can I say? ?? If only this was a real, full movie full length! Hollywood studio executives ?? take notes! This is how it should be! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I once again intrigued by the various reactions cracked by this short film evoked from the fans. In fact, the most accelerated and negligible reaction of it clearly comes once more (like Like Batman: Dead End) from a lesser, less experienced cinematically audience; a fact betrayed by a slightly grammatically primitive rendition and liberal use in the basis of diction. Like an unfortunate state of minded minds is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one of the aforementioned studio executives in Hollywood, they will no doubt derive great satisfaction. After all, those same ones are required in exact probability the same sort of CGI addiction, popcorn stuffing stacks that revelations in the majority of crap that Hollywood churns out of the timeframe.
