I loved this movie. It's another Yash movie rage that you know will look good on the screen, all the characters are always nice or very nice with an exception that you know will eventually covert them to be beautiful ... Another rule in the movie Yash Mania is that either hero or heroine; s only one or no parent. Think about all these films .. MPK Suman had no mother, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, AND Final rule is that you are 90% chance to see Alock Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> It is also good. It's a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but it makes you smile often enough. The little kid (nephew of the hero) is well placed and delivers very good criticism. The actress is very nice but shy you would not find that in real life. This movie does not have many family members happy to live in BIG home that I was a good idea and allowed the movie to be differentiated from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There is not a strong message from this movie but it's a good look. If you are married (wedding row) the movie will remind you of what you have to do. But if you're not going to be informed and can scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall a very good looking movie. No great plot or twist but a very gentle film, much like Bollywood classic.
