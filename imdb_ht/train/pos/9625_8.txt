On the first watch this movie it is difficult to know what happened, but on a subsequent look it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in Bob's role. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, first, he was out of the trap of Bob but I really believed he landed up his love although by then he broke his heart. Dean Dean's performance was an excellent one. It gets better with every movie she does. My only question at the end of this movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. He left for the viewer to decide
