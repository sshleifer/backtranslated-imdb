There are many love in this little little comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just was short of space, will find that there are more than just a tablet of truth in combat of the gentleman Blanding.Melvyn Douglas, with great rocket comedy, both narrated and acts as the Blandings attorney 'and voice of the reason.As well Myrna Loy is at her best as a spreading stylish but very patient wife. But the best performance is Grant. It is all American, especially important at this time to release this movie, when the nation was in flu into a housing shortage after the end of the war.

Looking at the movie is Slick, and some great comedy bits are well, particularly toward the beginning. While it may have lost some of its social significance, nearly sixty years after it was released, it is still a gem.
