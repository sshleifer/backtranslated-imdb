This is one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. He was the first Gable-Crawford couple, and he made it obvious to MGM and the audience being a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more movies with them as star stars. Conveniently painted the slippery bottom of a siblings who, after their father lost everything in the stock market crash, must unravel themselves and work for a living. Life is difficult in the Depression, and soon the same attempts to find legitimate work proven useless, and resort to hellwork. Joan Crawford is excellent as the socialite-turn-moll. It is smart, complex, and credible. It even storms in the theater of actors early actors of other actor Talkie. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the-rock, masculine and gray as gangster of no-nonsense who gets involved with Crawford's character. Even this year she would play a similar role as even more successful opposing Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", keeping her position as a male sex symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, do not miss "pay", which he did a year earlier, which is also among his best talkie early performances. <br /> <br />
