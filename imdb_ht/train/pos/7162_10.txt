This is one of my favorite movie ever. I read the book and love it, but this movie increases on everything the book made famous. The act is fantastic, especially in Jon Voight, which plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This movie has a certain way of telling stories that keep you hooked at all, until the end where everything pulls together for a great finish. I also love the way this is directed, not flashing back and forth between the modern day and the story of Stanley's story. This story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis does a good job directing it. I definitely recommend this to anyone enjoying good movies.
