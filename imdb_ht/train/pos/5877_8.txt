Well this movie is fine as I said but you surely need to look it as it's worth a look. It's about two boys Mac and Sam who have great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating with 3 hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious. Sam arrives fortune and almost forgot his friends, but not completely. But Mac thinks that and so it starts dating with air hostesses. There are at masala garam in each stage of the movie, rock songs, but few people miss. The comedy is not up to the mark and deserves a prize. It is nice but not all that is excellent. Some people laughed until they got sick but did not deserve so much laugh. But of course everyone's people are different. So if you want to watch the movie you are welcome to do so.
