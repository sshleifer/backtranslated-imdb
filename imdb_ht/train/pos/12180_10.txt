In my opinion, something GUY is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful flick chicks that guys will also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a horse-to-be-veterinarian and her lay-in-to-be cousin-in-law. If you ask me, they light the screen as magic. You can also feel the chemistry between them. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that the performance was top grade, the direction was damaged, the design was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, anyone in a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You're in for much of laugh and emotions, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
