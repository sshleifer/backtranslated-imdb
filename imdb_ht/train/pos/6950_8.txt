On the day of the Presidential Election California, between night and 1:00 AM, Victor Rovner's spy sent a message from Kuala Lumpur to USA. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Federal Agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and has problems at home with his daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Teri for putting Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decided to have a serious conversation with Kim, and discovered that the girl was running home. While trying to solve his domestic problems, he called Jack to his terrorist unit by Nina Myers's colleague for a meeting with Richard Walsh's chief, who revealed a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, whom who are running for president, and need to find the shooter. And Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there is a plot of the agency against David Palmer, and assigned Jack to find the plot. When an aircraft explodes on the Mojave Desert, Jack has another problem to worry about. The first episode of "24" is a promising start of a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time that I watched this show and I confessed that I loved what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three challenging missions at the same time: finding a killer protecting an important politician; get a betrayal of his agency; and find her teenage daughter, who is getting into trouble, while trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
