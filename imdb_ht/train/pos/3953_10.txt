I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and never saw it again. For my life, I could not remember the title and just stumble across it while checking Roy Thinne's credit movie. Excellent, obscure, and spooky TV movie cinema in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of blacks"; and "Satan's School for Girls", all classic classic Satanic. I also think it's very much parallel to Clint Eastwood's classic, "High Plains Drifter". Why not release these great little movies, especially when you consider the most recent garbage that filters the disc DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these flicks have a cult-such, so sales should not be a problem.
