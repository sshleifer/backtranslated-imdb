This is a cool movie fantasy. One of my fairytales, it's really so cool. The director is Bernard Rose who went to direct Candyman, making a great start with this movie. The film about a girl named Anna is ill and glandular fever on her 11th birthday. He draws a house on a little bit of paper out of his exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Each subsequent dream has changed by the presence of whatever it adds to the picture. In the third dream she met a boy she thinks she created Mark. He befriends her and her relationships become stronger as dreams become darker and scary. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that, after just one movie, she should disappear and never be at anything ever again. She really does a great performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer also ace. Much like Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. It's a real shame that the band is not available on CD again. The DVD is available only in R2.
