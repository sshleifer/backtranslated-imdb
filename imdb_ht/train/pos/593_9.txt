Show this game lasted just one season, but it was intriguing audience because it requested visual aptitude and a fixed hand. A fake move would disqualify the competitor from winning the prize, even though it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always interesting as the contestant started drawing, asking them if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other competitors to easily win the competition. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that competitors were often times to embarrassment from a funny mistake doing involuntarily. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one season. Only a seasonally display show show will remember this show, as it proves to be quite popular, even though the game shows made a great return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950s show. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never seen again.
