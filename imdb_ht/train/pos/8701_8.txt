For all those who expect a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. It is definitely more of a drama than a movie action. It focuses primarily on emotions and it's a bit like a Greek tragedy - regardless of the main character it still goes wrong somehow. That is because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands and society does not appreciate it. Sasha gets a bandits. While on the run, she meets a beautiful girl and falls in love for things to get even more complicated for her. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the movie is lacking in dynamics. He reminded me a bit of the narration of the recent cinemas by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when a scene scene has become so dynamic dynamic that before you realize what's happening, it's all over. But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and bursting actions. What's more important here is the result of Sasha's action, which is especially very radical. The note is very rare, which also makes it harder to focus on the movie. So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? This is a really difficult question to answer. I do not think this experience is rich to me, but somehow I keep thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. Mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but it does not matter because Sasha's and Katya have hope. After all they are young, have their whole life in living. So, no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight tune of joy when they are together.
