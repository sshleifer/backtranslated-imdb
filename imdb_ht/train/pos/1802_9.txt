Well, I've seen this movie as a kid and really liked it. My parents never bought the movie for me, but I think I'll go over and buy it right now. I'm a soloist for pre-2000 animated film. Anyway, on the current review. <br /> <br /> What I liked: There was a real paint in the sky and hell, one of the few I saw in the animated film. Character development existed! It's easy to classify the character of this movie (ie: Charlie is the selfish egoist, Itchy is cynical but believes Charlie, Carface is obviously the merciless cruel, etc.). I also love Gator's singing. I've always loved loud, annoying, flamboyant guys. This song may be random, but it was so fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could tell Charlie was all gray and stuff and the beautiful ones. <br /> <br /> WHAT I NEED: The current painting in the sky: how Charlie reacted to it, "there is no surprise too", did it actually looks boring. He refused a place in the sky and always returned to him in the end. I remember a few lines of certain songs such as "... you can not hold a good dog down", "let's make music forever," and "... welcome to die", but I'm not can recall the majority of any of them. The songs were not catchy, to be honest. Whippet Angel: It's annoying with that NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My Parents Do not Like: A very scary few (depending on the viewer) images of hell shown during the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implicit, but not actually dubbed beer. Gambling is a key element in the movie. The good guy dies. <br /> Everywhere I like this movie, though it's a bit forgettable at times. Young children's animations are always my favorite. This was created back at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give children a little scare now and then. Nowadays, probably this should be rated PG. Children under 8 years old (or well-behaved children) should not look at that. Other than that, I gave it 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy Viewing!
