The only part missing in this film is Shue's party as the daughter wants to follow in her "aunt" track as a starry soap star. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. It seems that every actor enjoyed the parties and overacting to satisfy their own fun as well as the script - I have to ask if a small ad lib'ing would be taking place in part . It has been well disposed and there are some classic lines that will stick to you. It's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once. I would recommend drinking anything that would smell out your nose. <br /> You will definitely want to look at the latest scene, 'Nurse In' has a little secret he'd rather not share with you. <br /> If you like soap or daydream, this move pokes fun in everywhere.
