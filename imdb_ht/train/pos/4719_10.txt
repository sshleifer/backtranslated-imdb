This movie is why I found this website. I could not get this movie anywhere else! I'm glad we find it here! We've seen it on television before and wanted to desperately get it and buy and have many friends who are interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring, though I must say it is NOT. Especially if you are a human horse, you will love this movie. The horses are awesome, well-trained and the movie is well done. It is certainly one we will buy for our DVD DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The bond between humans and horses in this movie was so inspiring and make you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie that we will look at many times.
