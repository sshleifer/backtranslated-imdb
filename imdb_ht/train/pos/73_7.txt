This is essentially a variation of House of Wax, in both the plot and type of role played by the star of both movies, Vincent Price.In both photos he plays a talented artist who reverses the corner of creation air frenzy He is stunned by others, less talented and less scrupulous .In this film he plays a designer of illusion for stage magician who hopes to wear out on a career performance itself only to be frustrated when another iluzyonist, the Great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists he honors his contract and gives him the first choice of any illusion he designs.Price already ill is willing towards Rinaldi as his ex-wife is now a paramour of Rinaldi. He deployed his talent as an illusionist and as a brilliant imperative for avenging himself on Rinaldi and others who block his plan for recognition as a scene and a designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well-rounded star to turn like a painful person who has predicates touching the audience's sympathy .The rest cast is competent if colorless and weighty In the entire enterprise fell on the cost of carrying the load with ease. <br /> solid B melodrama movie, this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable to you not expect a masterpiece .Mold black and white it is low on Gore and best seen this as melodrama and enjoying The presence of its stars gives a performance out
