"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialogues in recent memories. Watching this comedy led by the Anthony and Joe Russo brothers remind us of possibly another movie we've seen in the past, but since we missed the open credit, we had to wait at the end to discover that's what we Recalled, was 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street", directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers put together a nice cast to show all the characters in the movie. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jackson, in her, can not be bad. Since this is a piece of ensemble all characters get an opportunity in which to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie presents us a gangster group to have to be safe crackers from hell. No one might think that these guys could bring about a job as they are undertaking. Whatever could go wrong, and much more, is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney has a small appearance as safe cracker master who is also seen to imitate a rabbit, only to be confused with a priest by gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little little things do. Let the funny lines make you laugh, as one can see this gang ends from beginning to end!
