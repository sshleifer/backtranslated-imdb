This is superb - acting beautiful, lying, dressing, music - but most of all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised no more review of this movie - certainly one of the best in the 1980s. It is also a wonderful movie to see in the tandem and the great "Random Harvest" which has a lot of opening ups <br /> - a medium of age, unknown English WWI Officer is in a hospital at Direction of the war, suffers from shock shock and fills amnesia without any idea of ​​its name, origin, or anywhere it belongs - it proves to be a wealthy man established - when it "recovers", it will not remember year These before the war - <br /> But there are similar resemblances to the movies. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone who participated in the movie - particularly the actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a hot and amazing cast), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. One remains with you forever.
