This was the most expensive movie, when produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H. G. Wells were both saddened by his poor evaluation --- for good reason. He was and stayed far ahead of his time. From the direction of seemingly poor, probably correction, at the very beginning, the work moves together in a stunning conclusion. <br /> whether Ralph Richardson's Sir Boss' role, or even better, Sir Cedric's wife, as the space-dough opponent, Raymond Massey's' John Cabal 'role-all delivers mind-boggling performance. <br /> <br /> The scene with Mrs. Korda's incredible companion, in the little girl-child, runs out of a never-to-be-matched scene absolutely, commenting 'Just keep living lovelier and lovelier' life? which rapidly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. This is not a movie for the youth - unless 'experienced' and instead of the 'horror' he opposes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> rockets --- give Sir Korda a break - Mr. Wells made that choice. and in +/- $ 8 million, this film went beyond 'over-budget' --- so he focused on what he could manage. <br /> <br /> The true power of this Greatest of movies rests in the Cabal's final John Cabral finalist in his human destiny --- his' pasworthy 'friend's wisdom of space-faring, saying,' We are like little animals. ' John Cabal's good answer is, (paraphrase) Yes, little animals, and if it's all we are, we must live and die like that. ' They stand under a large astronomical telescope. He sweeps his hand over the night sky. 'But we can have all the universe, or nothing.' ---- Then the final chorus broke in --- 'Who is he?' --- This is not 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner' --- anything you can consider 'Great' --- this is the real thing. <br /> I remember all Steven Hawking's most recent addresses, the latest 'Medal of Honor' --- mankind must leave Earth, or die .--- very core of this work --- I love 'entertainment standard '--- yet this' relic', for the wise viewer, offers far more. 'Who should it be?' be in good 'mood' --- whatever it takes - this will take your breath --- I 'guarontee' --- in general, for humanity? most important in movies. <br /> <br /> since posting, I remember much being commented on the poor 'media-quality' of 'survival' example. In the 80's I developed a 'proprietary' colorization process that requires a 'own' original. This led me to Michael Korda, who sadly noted all went away - so we must relish what remains - 'sad but true? '
