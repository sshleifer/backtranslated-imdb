Back when musicals were not exhibits for choreographers, we had beautiful movies like this one. <br /> Being a great fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was happy to finally see this movie. Not quite a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the Americans humorous vaudeville, slapstick are not the witty plenitude, clashes and British Wodehouse's sense of humor. But on the whole, the American style style makes American characters look like real but caricatures. <br /> There are some arrivals invented for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground and gimmick flooring and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a busy Berkley on the top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do not hurt the movie, rather than allowing different dynamic characters to emerge. It's also nice not to have a wise brave, love headstrong interest. Instead we have a love heart Headstrong interest, far more in keeping with Wodehouses' young aristocratic women.
