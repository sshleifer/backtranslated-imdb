Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be and practically no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. RRW delivers all these and more. Nic Cage plays a former sailor, wounded in Lebanon, who went down to his 5th last dollar after he refused a job on an oil because of his bad knee. It's the role of Red Rock and is mistaken by Bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite as ominous-but still evil) for someone knocking-out in Texas. <br /> It paid him to kill his wife and make it look like theft. Only when he gets there, just to check out it. He offered him double to kill Wayne. Cages just want to get the hell out of the city with his free money and let the peer lovers be. But a series of misconceptions with his out-of-the-ying result in and out of Red Rock, returns with ideas. Eventually this led to a run-in and Lyle from Dallas (a crap and somehow sympathetic Hopper Hop), REAL hit-men from Texas who offered to help without knowing it made the plot more complicated. RRW has never had a great release, so most of it's audiences have discovered it on video or on TV cable TVs. Seeing it in a way might make it seem like a movie movie but it's bigger than that. Straight, slow-scheduled direction, Moody notes and windy winds would have been all made for a great movie in the theater, but the best you can do these days is to watch the DVD on a great HDTV. Only the weakest point in the film I can think of is Lena Flynn Boyle's fatigue and the embarrassing dye-ichh growth. I certainly would not fall for it but if you assume the character Nic Cage is in militant lesbians then you will accept it however.
