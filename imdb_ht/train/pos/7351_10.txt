This is one of Govinda's most popular films ever and best movie in 1994. David Dhawan has done a great job in directing this movie, making it funny and adding family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro of acting and yet giving a superb performance. Ariel Irani is terrific as the mother and gives an exceptional performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as the Nandu sidekick. This film contains comedy, action, family drama and a romance full of Entertainer.
