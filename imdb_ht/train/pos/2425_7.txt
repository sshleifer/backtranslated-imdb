I kept this movie on IFC and I loved it, although I felt like the correction work was a bit rough, though it might have been deliberate. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a non-linear Fiction-style scheme presentation. It seemed a little forced, though. I certainly think that the movie is worth watching, but I think he could use a little cleaning. Some scenes just do not seem to make sense after others. <br /> I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It's not exceptional, but it does not matter really seriously. I gave it a 7/10. The film showed at least Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to be in the Matrix movies.
