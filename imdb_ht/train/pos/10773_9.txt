I would recommit this movie to everyone. Not only the fans of Luciano Ligabue's roker, but in all film-rifles. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a producer of a movie lover, and each frame of his movie is made with love and care. Because his characters love and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian films are lousy and this one, made by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, like Freccia, beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroine, which League shows as it is, onlamoric and ugly, without livestream moralism easy. Because it is a movie that speaks to our hearts, our ears, our souls. And because I lived on FM radio and it was exactly like that. Thanks, Luciano!
