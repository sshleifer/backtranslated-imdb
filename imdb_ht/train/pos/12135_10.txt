Each Bette Davis star's motion picture is worth experiencing. Before Davis co-star and Leslie Howard of "Human Bondage," he would have been in more than one note in movies. Legend has it that Davis was 'thief' at an Oscar 1935 for his performance as a speaker-speaking waitress, single mother and manipulative companion user, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that the AFI console Davis does not award its 1st Oscar to play Joyce Heath's "Dangerous." I imagine Davis' fan of the "Bondage of Humans" that agrees with the Oscar-thief legend will have to contradict my criticism of the film in 1934 for which the aforementioned did not give her performances & films in 1936 "Dangerous," Performance for which he received his 1st Oscar in 1937. <br /> I tried to see all Bette Davis' photos, TV shows, videos, commercials for WWII & TV performances in popular series. In retrospect, it is easy to recognize why this movie, "In Human Bondage," gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for its performance. It was only 25yo when the movie was finished and just about to reach the Hollywood red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of his performance in "Human Bondage." This is what makes it its legendary performance. But RKO has seen its scope of "the man who played God," & borrowed from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> I will go with the AFI, in hindsight, some 41 years after the rising decision of Davis 1st award to Oscar's best comedy for "Dangerous," 2 years later. When they do this, AFI can be instrumental in carrying out the best of one of Hollywood's most talented 20th Century actors. Because of the "human bondage," Davis knew for certain that he had to reach deep inside of himself to get the performances that earned him the golden image. Undoubtedly, it deserves more than 2 Oscars; Maybe as much as 6. <br /> <br /> "Harmful" gives an exemplary contrast to Davis' depth of character character. For, it's "Dangerous" (1936) that he became the greatest actor in the 20th century. Davis is so good as Joyce Heath, she died-center on the red carpet. While in "Human Bondage," Davis is right off the corner, still on the sidewalk & ready to take on the rest of his career acting 60 years. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not granting that Oscar legend in 1935, instead of a star held, an actor was given incentives to reach beyond the vastness of his soul for the greatest actor's work have the donation. <br /> It is well known that its contemporary opponent was Joan Crawford; A performance star still does not measure up to Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'. Howard Stern is a star 'star' star, too. Many people on the scene and the silver screen are the stars. Some have become big actors. The difference between them is that Bette Davis could sense: the difference between the desire to make big act or to become star-hit. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies as I have, look one right after the other. Perhaps you will recognize what the AFI & I did. Davis was on his way to becoming one of the greatest 20th Century actors in 25yo and achieving his goal when he was 27 years old. He spent the next 50 years his set up so high that he did not arrive. . . again. <br /> <br /> The aficion had sent the message that it would happen to "in human bondage," Davis's life story as a great actor can be directed to star-hit-dom, rather.
