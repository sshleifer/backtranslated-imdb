This excellent set, told by Laurence Olivier, is brilliant, it should be said, the beginning of the chart at the end of the Second World War. The origins are not entirely examined completely from Germany's fall in the hands of the Versailles treaty that helped push up Hitler's deacons, but as a hard revision, which must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with lots of bashing. <br /> <br /> Apart from photography of action / hoping combat, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that have given the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you do not necessarily a 2-Buff War 2 fan. The episodes that show 'testimony' and what life was like on the front of the main ally / opponent, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the US has been quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme wildlife of the war on the line and of course the suffering of civilians, death camps etc., were very well occupied with exposure. I would highly recommend this to any history class for the younger generation (in which he could say I'm one of 47!). <br /> <br /> Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of new era jet starts, with the experimental jet glitter Frank Whittle and the first combat Meteor as well as this in German Messerschmitt in May 262 - especially as the V-1 saw its first and was surprisingly smaller mentioned in the V2. This is probably a small oversight, by referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons WW2 brought forward to a more old-born science. But a huge set of brands has been doing so since ever since happily repeated. A set of possessions as a set of storytellers, DVDs for anyone who is specifically featuring a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and TV Thames should be quite proud.
