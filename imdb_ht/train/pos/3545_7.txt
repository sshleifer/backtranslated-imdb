Big movie splashy in the Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to roll the bones and organize illegal illegal games. Blonde loves Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry her IF she gives up crap. He decides on a recent game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets great, is in the city. She bets Sky that she can not find Sarah Brown's worker (Jean Simmons) mission with her in Havana. It may sound like a summary sketch summary but it's the movie! <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are some wonderful things here. The songs are indeed and the dance is incredible. The real show band is in the crap game at the end. Also Brando is really good here - it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but pulling it off. I must admit that great, brandy candy crawling in some tough dance moves was a lot of fun! Also sinatra is very good and Blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. Its songs and dance are highlighted here. Now, for the bad parties - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but he was stuck with a drab without color roles and can not do much with it. The film is far too long in 150 minutes - the scene between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have been shortened. Also most of the characters speak in very precise English - shrinkage never used. Maybe she tries to be fun coming out of the mouths of gangsters but I get it jarring and she keeps sending me out of the movie. It's worth catching for the songs and dance but the length of it gets you after a while. I give it a 7.
