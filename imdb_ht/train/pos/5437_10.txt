Pandro S. Berman was "in charge of production" but that made him the so-called producer of the line. But who produced this season, filmed not in Arizona but in the wilderness of Mohave California where scavengers were cut off with all of the remnants of the "golden temple", the Thuggee huts, the British first in Muri, village in Tantrapur, etc. Minor technical fault can and must be forgiven. What's incomprehensible is the lack of an Oscar for better music, although perhaps the Academy did not offer as of the moment. A single theme has been played in various stages including waltz, march and sweet, environment-setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of production is Kipling's widow's quest. An actor playing Kipling appeared shortly before and after the battle scene. At the initial release, his scene was cut off, for Mrs. Kipling's request. Later they were included and lent a "connection" to Kipling's immortal poem in Ben Hecht's scenario. Interestingly, this story is very typically and pro-British was not a great senarist who himself hated the British.
