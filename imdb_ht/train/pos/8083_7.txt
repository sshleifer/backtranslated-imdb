If you've read the books then forget the characters that Tolkien build in yourself. Representation of hobbits, nose etc. has been 'disney' treatment. The dark passengers are excellent, and as I've always imagined in the books. <br /> <br /> This cinematic is an excellent movie, mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. I just want it (Bakshi) gave the money to complete his season. <br /> It's worth to have the video as they'll be worth a bit after 2001 the Lord in the Rings !!
