I was impressed by the beautiful photography of this movie, which was shot aside in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see many of Eskimos's activities involved, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And customs, such as offering their visitors visitors, are regularly in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes out of stock stock, as it was easy to recognize some projection scenes behind animals, but even these were fascinating. Fishing spears for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a candle made it look like a documentary at times. There was no list of cast, which strengthened the flavor of documentary. Movie makers tried to make it look very authentic, and native speakers speak only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by interstellar. The introduction claimed that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there was no actor in the movie, but this was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors and credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup. But they were excellent in their role and were going to have Hollywood career. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a look.
