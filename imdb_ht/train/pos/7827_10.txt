This film is, simply, brilliant. Cinematography is a good thing, the superb act and the absolutely enchanting story. This is the story of Donald Woods, a South African whiter who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely compelling - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV a few years later, I recognized him from Kline's paintings. Denzel Washington also turned into a masterful performance, as ever. <br /> I ask you to watch this. It is long, but it's worth your patience because it says such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.
