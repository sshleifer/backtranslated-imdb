Probably the first Portuguese film I saw in my life, and I loved it. The plot relates to how the young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974, finally defeating the Fascist government in Caetano and also finalizing the wars in the colonies, the Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Verde. Most of the events shown in the film reflect and the behavioral behavior of the army officers and soldiers to make the coup, in the oppressed people, who were very happy with the new development and freedom of the male Caetano's resistance, and also It's a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who has been taken as the new president. The Portuguese Revolutionary Revolution may recall the actions of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the movie was when the captain's youth expressed that Portugal should develop himself democratically, and that is what the country achieved a few years after the coup this or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never want to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
