This is a short time (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it has a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, a lot of soil is covered. <br /> It was soothing at times, but there were some dramatic moments, too, covered by a cricket attack at the end of the movie. That was surprising to see. Consider this film is about 70 years old, the team-effects of the crew on this movie have made a spectacular job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer have been award-winning actors in their day and do not disappoint here, both providing powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all Asian are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just do not look real. I would like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC purposes but simply making history look and sound more credible.
