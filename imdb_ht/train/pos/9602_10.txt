Darius Goes West is a film that shows American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled with sometimes movie secretary shows a young man who never expected, but longing to see, what was outside the boundaries of his beautiful city in Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the sea. Longtime friend Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius want to come true. Began - Ben & Logan's mother started an email campaign to bring consciousness to Darius: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and raise funds for fellas to take Darius not only to see the sea, but to see those great United States. To tell young college friends to succeed in bringing hope and consciousness to this dreadful disease would be an understatement. They realize the dream of Darius and some people. They put their lives in keeping while showing love, care and tons of fun in Darius while helping Darius to see how it can in turn show those features even to others who suffer from DMD. Darius went to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his seat collecting money (along with his colleagues) outside a local grocery store. Wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hopefully with a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no others deserve it more. With Sweeney.
