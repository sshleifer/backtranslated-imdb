I do not know if I'm just weird but I enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Cabin by the Lake is the end of another one of my favorite movie Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that casting in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is still the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming at Stanley's Skyplay skater by the Lake - it was not a completely redundant film in Stanley grabbing other girls and dropping them. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way over two hours, then go ahead and watch it. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
