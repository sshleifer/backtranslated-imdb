Stargate is the best show ever. All actors are absolutely perfect for those roles. I like the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Trek a lot of the time it actually can not because it is completely different. I'm a star trek fan, but I would definitely rate this show well above any of the star track. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV so if I want to see it I have to buy DVDs and season 10 is not out here yet so I can not see it for some time (which is very depressing). However this program is very good and is a must see, but to warn it is highly addictive. So in summer I love Stargate (and Amanda tapping).
