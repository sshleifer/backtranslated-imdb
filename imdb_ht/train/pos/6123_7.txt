Before I comment on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this film, I expect the typical crap, horror, B-movie and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers, but is actually one of the best that I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future of being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance. McDonald is a serial killer that gets a snowman in some casual stupid mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman starts moving and killing, though, you will find it hard not to laugh. The lines say they are completely delayed but really funny. The fact that the rest of the completely over-act cast just adds to the sort of movie, but it's sort of its genius. The scene where the snowman is and the young girl is really classic in B movie, movie movie fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I'll be able to watch it on whatever channel can do it. Of course it is only fun to look at the first few times and it's not exactly a good job of motion picture technology, but I just love seeing murderous snowmen. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dating and couples in the late hours.
