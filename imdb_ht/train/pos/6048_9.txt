What a bit class of British movies! It's about time. With a side split the boot comedy! <br /> Anyone who seeks to relve a bit of liberty to young misps this road movie will prove the ticket. <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail and I" and "Easy Rider". The movie runs in a solid rhythm and does not let you drift off for too long ... At times there are meditative moments, but I think they are quite justified and added to the characters the actors are showing. I was a little concerned with Phil Daniels' character at the beginning, but Fortunately had won over half of that was one of the funniest movies in the movie all! I usually find myself laughing at the film most likely to harass some people around me. Oh well. <br /> I would highly recommend it. This will be a British cult comedy. Well worth a visit.
