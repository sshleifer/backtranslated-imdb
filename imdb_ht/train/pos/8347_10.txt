Perhaps I was too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it many times, but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, which has nothing big or monumental to happen. But I'm a big boyfriend and this movie * is * romantic. I like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists made me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. It's like a clean, good movie - and so are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just a chick-flick movie. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are just lonely and you need to * look * a romance, if you yourself can not participate in one. It's a good 'un!
