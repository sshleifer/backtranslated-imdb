Thomas Capano was not the leader of Marie Tom Carper, the Governor. This is the reason Feds was involved, she called Clinton and asked her to get Feds involved in the case. I lived out of Philadelphia at the time for the case to be news front pages every day. I read the Ann Rule book and saw the "High Confidential" segment of A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomania (sp.), An uber-controller with a monster. He stated that they love Ann Marie but all he wanted was someone he could control. When he did not let him do that again he killed him, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that it is still alive.
