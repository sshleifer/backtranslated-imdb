I intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Marcello Mastroianni and many unmatched films in it that I owned on VHS; However, given my steady light-hearted Christmas marathon, I did with just this one! As it happens, it features one of its best performances - and has just been Oscar-nominated for it (and the movie itself was similarly). This was also one of 14 collaborations with the most widely recognized stars from Italy, Sophia Loren; Both, incidentally, are playing against quality here - it's like an eagle housewife and it's a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the film title has a double meaning: the leading characters brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself showed in long archival footage), but more specifically referred to the stars' stars in which they shared moments of friendship, revelation, and, temporarily, passion - even though every one knows that a return to normal existence is inevitable , which leads to the brutal film ends. This is usually a two-mener (and all other characters - save for the natural goalie of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety - including Luff's Gruff and patriotic facial husband, surprisingly played by John Vernon, appears only at the beginning and closing sequences); Still, the restrained environment does not discourage Scola's director (for the record, this is the 7th film in which I watched and owned 3 more on VHS) and Cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - though essentially low- key - is far from stagy: the camera is enabled to rediscover the various sections of the big building, observe the laying procedures or dispassionately as the situation requires, but still breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be persuaded, and they both deliver (chemistry on screen is quite incomparable); It's interesting, however, that while Loren walked away with the awards in their home territory, it's Mastroianni and is moving again unsentimental outsider (the movie, somewhat dubiously, seems to equalize its sexual harassment and anti- fascism!) that generally impresses international audiences!
