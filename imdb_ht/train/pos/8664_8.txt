Device, Powerful Gangster Supreme Frankie Diomede (always rugged Lee Van Cleef's in fine form) was himself arrested and sent to prison for rubbing out a detective sensitive partner detection. Fawning goofball little time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (a paint Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an easy friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and help him on his quest for precise revenge on a rival band at mobsters lead by the blood of Louis Annunziata (seamlessly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working in a script absorbed by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relies on the history of its own at a constant speed rhythm, sustaining a robust, but occasionally tonharted tone of all, with action action steps rousing alongside considerable rip-snorting brio (a rooftop shower rack'n'tumble with a mondo destruction machine destruction rate as the definitive individual positioning). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a beautiful, loose and engaging sketch on screen; The relationship between the characters is vivid and touching. The Edgewige Fenech's slave does not give much to do as Tony's girlfriend whinn's but at least gets her gorgeous and voluptuous body in a shower show shower show everyone very appreciated. Riz Ortolani in groovy, pulsating, sincopated funk / jazz scores certainly hit the soulfully swinging place. Cinematographed polluted by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is similarly. A really nifty and entertaining little winner.
