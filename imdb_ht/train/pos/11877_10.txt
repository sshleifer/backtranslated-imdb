Led by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) came to America for American dreams. Montana then becomes the "king" of the drug world as he mercifully runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has about 180 + F-words and is almost three hours. This movie is fun and you will never get bored. You applaud for the master's drugs, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as bad as some other Lord's crimes. This is a masterpiece and I recommend that you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
