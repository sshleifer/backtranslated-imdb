Delightful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in fine form as a medium age spinster whose interest turns into magic at World War 11 England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the movie and is just ideal for the party. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time is for the benefit of the kids and for England mom during a time of great danger. The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as the professor of magic tried to find certain information about sorcery. Those 3 small darlings sent to live with Price to save the London bombs are just wonderful in this enchanting movie for all of us regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Hyper Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are little donated to this endearing movie. <br /> I really thought of the movie by Ben-Stiller- "Night of the Museum," at the end of the movie when the relics come to life to make war with the Nazi invasion of the small British coastal town.
