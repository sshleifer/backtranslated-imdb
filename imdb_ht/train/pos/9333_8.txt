Having lived in Ontario all my life, in the same city that Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories about it from my parents, grandparents and family members. So, when I found that they should film a movie about it, and that the beginning should be shot on my street, and its home close to me I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the Book of a Baby Bye's book, which is about Marlene Moore you get quite the different image of her as a human being, she was considered awkwardly beautiful by those who really was lucky to know him with the exception of his own family that often abuses him as a child, except one of his brothers. Also, if you live in my area and are smart enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you would find that she was really injured before she even joined the institution, she was still defensive and what would seem like a learning uncertainty in a school environment was actually embarrassing about the fact that he could. Marlene did not deserve the life she was given, and the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and people around him who helped more to his death by not trying to understand his needs and why he did what he did. I always find myself angry that he was imprisoned for self-defense from a man who tried to rape him. As his brother once said, "They did not know what to do with him to shut him down and killed him." I believe in that with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Stay in peace Marlene, you deserve it very much.
