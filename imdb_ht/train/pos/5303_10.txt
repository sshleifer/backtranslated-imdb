John the Water ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen in a while. It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a warhol-love-use of colors, exaggerated emotions and emotions. Pecker gets bigger than the city she can handle, and it separates from her love (including a sexy Ricci) by her man-loving art manager. The photo leaves a refreshing taste in my mouth - kind of like a fresh ice cream on a hot summer day - and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made everything more profound and crucial. It is a celebration of life, freedom, and the right to carry arms ... and everything else that country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
