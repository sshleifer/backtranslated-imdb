When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it, and my first game was Super Mario 64.And I love it! The graphics were great for her time, a good plot, great strokes and above all, the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> I do not remember the plot completely, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by bowser, and Mario has to rescue him. The object of the game is to find 120 stars from the curse of the castle.Each had about five or six challnges to find the stars.There are secret parts of the castle, where you can find more stars.But, of course, you have to beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Allow to start with the characters.Mario is the main character, and it gets helpful advice from frogs, so it is basically one of your only covenants. I hear that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end.The main hover is Bowser, and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> Next, how about the graphics? People who say gameplay is much more important then the graphics and agree completely. But with it's great draw, there are great graphics. Especially for it's time. I have a whole bunch of other Nintendo games like 007 and graphics they do not compare with Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and effects sound effects. I find the graphics in the very very good water courses.Next of the worlds Bowser, it has the best graphics in the game . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> for the music would put me to sleep. Especially music from Jolly Roger Bay, was peaceful and wonderful.Others also have many, especially in, once again, their world and Bowser, that's They stick with me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite time as a gamer develops, and I love it.This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** ( 5) Go the game!
