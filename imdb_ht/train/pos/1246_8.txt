Mostly this may look like idiocy, but since Murphy's characters do not take it seriously, it helps to facilitate the audience of this blend of mysterious and modern day-hard boiling kidnapping kids. Excellent cast, particularly Charles Dans and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy are at his 80s peak height in comedy / action. There are also some great F / X, a very sure sequence of dreams, and an original justice scheme. Often neglected at Pantheon Murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.
