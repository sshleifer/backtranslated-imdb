This excellent drama has made me in suspense all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second because every word kept connecting the pieces into this puzzling murder. This film really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really cried in the end (which I do not want to give away!) It also leaves me realize how bad and sick people can when it comes to killing. <br /> <br /> The throw was also very good. Only bad members of the cast were the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a good job, but the director did not. I say this because he found someone who did not look a bit bit like Anne Marie Fahey himself.
