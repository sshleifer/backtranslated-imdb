What a germ in a movie, so good that they made an end. The movie starts in really good with a nasty monster that eats a few people and a party where the first two main characters first sight on each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays Vlad's unique, a bit of an incling there in which this character is, who has moved to town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've seen all vampire movies, we know the format. The movie is watchable, but the performance of the actors is very sticky and they seem as they do not want to be in this movie, but that's just that all part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It was not like finishing, but there is a sequel, be followed down. /> <br /> When I watched the movie I thought Brendan Hughes did not really fit the part. And I could not stop thinking about him, and the sort of hesitant a strange sensuality, so maybe it was good for the party. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> as Lt Guffman. Where is it now?
