Holly addresses the topic of sexually exploiting children across the world (some 2 million children trafficked each year), and sensitive and without manipulation - a high order that the team of Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington star in the movie along with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring to the screen what is commonplace in the people of the notorious K11 writing district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a hefty topic, the movie keeps on laughing and hoping as we get to know the characters up close, holding the two-hour movie from being one that is too hard to watch. I'm happy a movie like this is to bring attention to the world of the problem. Children prostitution need to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and an EVERYONE movie to see.
