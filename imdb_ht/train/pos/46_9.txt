Just finished watching this movie for perhaps 7th or 8th time, taking it one night already seen in Blockbuster and absolutely loving it, I showed it to 4 people so far and enjoyed it as well. Avoid all glamorous Hollywood, the special effects and stress on the "shock factor", this film independent by Paul F. Ryan hitting the nail on the head in dealing with after being affected by traumatic situations. Take place after a high school shooting, two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an easy bail. Alicia, the girl and the stone heart, the Goth with a pessimistic attitude to life helps Deanna to overcome the problems of life and death and living in consequence. While Deanna tries to help Alicia see some of the world's fondness and lightness. Do not insist on the shocking event of the shooting, but on the interpersonal relationships among those who have survived it laying this movie apart. Despite low-budget and short film times, this movie is far from cheese. Ryan paid respect to a situation he never endured and tried to dig into the human psyche. With an amazing and upcoming actress, Philipps, adds the dramatic necessary to the dialogue and in general feel for the movie and Christensen helps to balance out the "bankruptcy and gloom" feeling this movie can have. In general, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I suggest the documentary "A World Girl" is expelled by CBC in 2004, which deals with the subject of social intimidation , compared to the controversy of one group of one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances at Dawn Marie Wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally entimide.
