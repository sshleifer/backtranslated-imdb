Erotic cinemas in the 1970s have been tame compared to the X's X's today, which is a good thing. Because there is a good story around the nude rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I hope that some vampire effects have been found in the time and sex periods found in the story's story a little. Plus some of the accents have been difficult to understand in the long period, but it's worth looking at the inertial version then the edited version titled THE DESIRED DEVIL. But if you do not care for allotted women dancing and sex, then this is not the movie for you. However, I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
