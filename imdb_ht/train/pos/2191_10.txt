Shakespeare said that we are actors put in a big step. But when this stage is Israel's work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we make are full of a tough style. Dan Katzir managed to make a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir managed to enter the heart of the Israeli people, and, these people, far from being simple face figures, to talk to we are in the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from black informative blacks in which they live, and this wonderful land reaches the light as a splendid bird made in his ashes. It is very good for me because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans know only for the informational journals or newspapers, appear as a closed and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people looking for its place, exploring All the state, the whole culture and the only purpose they feel is part of it. Katzir constructs an absolutely beautiful documentary and it demonstrates that when a person's films and passionate feelings are projected with strength, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thanks Dan to open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits in the world's most beautiful country.
