I liked this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful to her. Play the role of the modern wizard in the corner. (And it's absolutely adorable.) 2) The film helped to inspire a role-playing game I enjoy, mage: the awakening. I showed it to several LARP after-parties, and it's still a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well-done and quite enjoyable. The draw is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are very good for such a low budget, and the script, while there is nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in every place right. A good way to spend an evening.
