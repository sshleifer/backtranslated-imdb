I thought Mukhsin was beautifully writing. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin tried to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you (especially if you did not look Sepet and / or Gubra for 76 times). <br /> I bet you notice how to use characters in the two movies before right? It's really ironic how characters are related. Like the bossy neighborhood is that whore from Gubra. And the chick in the snooker pin turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /> And I absolutely love the voice-overs. Her lips are again awakeningly cool. Like, when taking a shot in the signature Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (scene when he climbed the tree). It captured the Malaysian attitude (and in some ways too mild, triggered by how minor it is) describes in the character. For example, even the kids can really sharpen tongued (filled with the annoying annoying voice) and simply bad lips all long films. And how can you be such a busy person and talk about ppl, when ur hay life is not sorted out. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, this movie totally reaches my expectations if it does not exceed it. <br /> It keeps me stuck on the screen, I could not even take my eyes on it. Do not even make out of the movie. Ha ha.
