This film describes the life of someone who grew up in worst in circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew to be a respectable person. What's more is that this is a true story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Famous Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and never deceived around with women, coke, cigars, weed, alcohol, or any of the very popular things in the places they are growing up. <br /> <br /> No more to say about this movie it is excellent. The only rating I can give is a 10/10.
