Domestic import was a big movie. I laughed the whole time. It was funny on many levels from the crazy teams to the hilarious situations. The act was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all others did a frightening job. Because it is an independent film written by a writer for the first time, he does not have the liking they expect from other comedies, which was such a relief. It was a unique and exciting and you fell in love with the characters and the heart-warming story. I heard he was based on a true story? If so, then that is hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
