All fans of Kira Reed must see this. The first movie of romance romance romance can come up with any new ideas. She also gets more than a divorce. However, he meets this guy in a restaurant and helps him out of his shell (and clothes). They go to a corner corner and do it. Fortunately, Kira has become a condom out (Now, never telling me that these Playboy movies are worthless in core-core core. Remember kids, safe sex). And he was surprised to publish it as it was, but he did not find his name. Despite this, the guy found it and continued to play the koken. But eventually it's rubber in his sneakiness, he wants to know more. When it does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys movie I've seen. Check out this, and wonder of the greatness of Kira.
