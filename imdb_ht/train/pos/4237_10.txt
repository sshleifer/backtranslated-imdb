Charleton Heston made one, James Franciscus put one but Mark Wahlberg opts by donating the traditional kidney cloth. I hope none of his projects like Tarzan. Linda Harrison has put a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but Estrella Warren barely shows her cleavage - her hair still in the way. Tim Burton was able to sex this simian legend & give adults to the audience something to look at. Even the helmet of Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her suit that looks like a big curtain. It is beautiful, but the love everything is the restraint seems to worry and a little bit bitty in the end. As in artificial intelligence that discusses gender species interspersed between robots & humans, but never delivers - Planets of these hints are appetites in interviews romantic species between the people & their but only suggestions. Lisa Marie is the only one to be sexy. This film has three great actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti grind the scenery as a trio of the Saints and have fun to watch. Superlative make up (a certain Oscar) costume, sets, music to make this movie in summer 2001.
