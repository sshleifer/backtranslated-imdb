I missed this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * It offers insight into something I barely understand - browsing surfers because it's all they want to do; Nothing else resembles many issues such as navigation; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for those * buried in the movie is a great storytelling; I never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and they have seen so much. Nobody taught me what this movie did * the movie was very well edited. It flows well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting to start finishing <br /> In summary, it's as good as a documentary as I've seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 10/10
