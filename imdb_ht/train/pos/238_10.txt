Can I imagine a movie better than this? Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I am a big Major and Muscular, Macho Man, who happens to think this was one of the best movies in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The act was superb and the story was wonderful. This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. The actress could not have been the best nor the best cast cast. <br /> I knew for a good while Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is among the greatest actresses ever seen on film. And of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this movie) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the trumpet magnum of his talents and his varied roles in years. At any rate this was a cast amazing. This movie was like a book that you can not lay, and when you got to the last page you want more ... always more. I can not for the life of I understand why this movie here on the IMDb only rates a 3.9 <br /> <br /> That rating here is absolutely amazing for me. Or maybe not. Maybe in reality I understand it all this time well and that's what makes me really sad. It made me sad so that films such as "American Beauty" "left Las Vegas" "animal creatures" and "club fight" skyrocket ratings cut off the charts of their popularity when in fact at least in view of this viewers should have received An "R" rating ... R is for "Garbage". Hey Ok, I realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences, but it's a sad next time then beautiful, powerful ... extraordinary, directed, acting, and filming seems to be about watching. <br /> It was obviously at the Academy Awards as well .... How sad. And how predictable. My source is that if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful story? watch ...... preferences own this movie ...
