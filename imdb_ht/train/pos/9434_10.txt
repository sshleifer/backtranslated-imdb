I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even miss the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was dull and rated. I decided to review it last night to see if I had missed the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films ever and it has clearly had a lot of influences on today's film and will probably be forever. I can not believe I thought this film was boring! <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give their performance to their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and great fright after you look it, it's really awful. Oh, and I mentioned that the theme song is great, as well? Well it is, and this movie should be seen by film fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for the experiment. Just do not expect a picnic.
