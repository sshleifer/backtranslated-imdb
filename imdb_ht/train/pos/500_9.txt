I, like many trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) Suffered in seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when she was over, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. Prayer , answer. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Cool perspective, radically different characters, new stunning visuals, a pop-song for the Intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. Sign me for 10 seasons in this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager," nobody misses you! Hold on Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
