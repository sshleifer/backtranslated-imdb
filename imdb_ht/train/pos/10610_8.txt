A sweet-natured young mountain with a sad passing (Henry Thomas) comes over a baby girl abandoned in the woods and immediately fell in love with her. Old cities support him in keeping the child, though a local storm (Cara Seymour) thinks little of the new family. A determined girl in a long walk and a disaster traveling hike (David Strathairn in her creepiest) has parallel parallels that converge in a decisive way. This is a good-of-life tranche of Ozarks in the same vein as "Where the Lillies Bloom" & "Dollmaker". All three were shot aside in these beautiful hills and covered the lives of simple-living - but not simple-minded - American folk. A minimum of two languages ​​and short-term violence is pointing to this fairly impartial family.
