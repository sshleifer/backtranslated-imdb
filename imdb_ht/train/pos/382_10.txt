One of the finest films ever made! Why it only got a rating 7.6 is a mystery. This film is a window in the world of black experience in America. They should be mandatory to look for everyone with white children and older children at age 10. I recommend watching it with the "Long Walk House" as a companion piece. If you think that Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Square," think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have the Oscar. (And read the book, too!)
