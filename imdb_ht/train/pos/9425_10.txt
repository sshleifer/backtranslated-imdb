A series of comedians from the 1990s (Two sets were made in total) suffered from the UK ratings due to poor schedules. When you arise against established comedy like 'Minder', even the best new comedies will struggle to get noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I keep the series out of episode one and follow it avidly. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else. Very, very frustrating .. Anyway, I liked both series and never forgot it. Then I watched him on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both released 'on his own' set. <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
