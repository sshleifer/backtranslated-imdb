Of all the football movies I watched, this is one of the best 2. Other were garbage fever. But Hero is on the world cup greatest ever and therefore arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around it primarily, but also revolves around the other giants in the game at the time. The music note is evocative with the powerful images. The narration by Michael Caine is fairly fair and also with dramatic calmness. This story is not about the individual games in the world cup; Rather read more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting game like France v Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were covered in the same vein. Argentina's final in Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watch over and over again, if you are a fan of Maradona.
