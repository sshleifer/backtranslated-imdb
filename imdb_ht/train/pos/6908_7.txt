Richard Dreyfuss star of "Moon Over Parador," a 1988 Paul Mazursky film also begins Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean at Parador making a movie. When the dictator suddenly dies, the Chief of Police Secret (Julia) who is one actually controls the dictator and the country, Jonathan's sheets play the dictator, he noticed the resemblances between them. Soon Jonathan is ensconced in the palace as Alphonse Simms, and Madonna's wife Madonna (Braga) wife who fulfills the promise promise to help him in any way he can. Mazursky, who appears in dragging as Simms' mother, gives us a look at how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winters, supposedly a seller, is actually a CIA operation. The movie, however, flirting with but does not really break down on very serious ground and is more of a throwing-up, and a funny one in that. Richard Dreyfuss performs a fabulous job as Jonathan Actress and Alphonse Dictator, creating two distinct characters and nailing them both. The gorgeous Soga Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia but in a funny comedy performance as Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It's one of those performances where you never know what the character is thinking - it can be nice or turn to psychic at any moment. Charo is at hand as a maid and managed to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> A very good movie, not a great but very fun blockbuster.
