Update the version of a story that came back to the movie in 1938 England (Return of the Frog) regarding the pursuit by the police in a master criminal known as the frog because of the frog like awakened (inflated eyes ets) put. <br /> One of the good Wallace movies from the 1960s it's a solid little entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or made this influence) resumed in these films Dr. Mabuse, the Frog seems to be more a super wicked than a thief master. While not the best of these Wallace movies, it's worth a look. It would make an interesting feature of the double and excellent movie ever. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
