This movie is gorgeous. It is real and down to heart, but at the same time totally crazy. The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have many different minds, but each of us could refer to at least about. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for some of I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny, and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see Loners.
