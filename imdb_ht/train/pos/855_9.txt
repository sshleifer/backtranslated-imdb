This movie is fantastic. Finally well-written characters you can love for the good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-erasing role. I think it's the best thing she ever did. He did other roles that show the shades of being able to this kind of fully-fledged work, but this role finally gave him the room to run with it. I almost died when she walked around the hotel lobby in her panties and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are also a couple of sights, as well as the actors aspire. Kinnear is so prevalent that his turn to the end is really enjoyable. You give the best actors to play and give us something more back.
