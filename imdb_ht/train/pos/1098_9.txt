Modern visitors are aware of this small film primarily as the noteworthy model, "The Money Grow." Older viewers today watch it and wisps in nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in an easier, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of changing perspectives, and the many films today Truth Stage and Social and Political Next, have a natural curiosity demanding on the greatest film conflict, seemingly less provocative. In "Mr. Blandings builds his dream home," there is power, therefore, there is more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. There is political commentary, however subtle. Finding a home in the late 40s was a truly exaspering experience, only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? Children Blandings always seem to talk about progressive ideas being taught at school (which in real life would find their teachers accused of communism). In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas did not have less a democratic firebrand: he married the Helen Gahagan Douglas Congress, whom young Richard Nixon was accused of being soft on communism (and ruined). Jason Robards, Sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activist had no less noticeable. His most important son, Jason Robards, Jr., would be for many years a highly liberal Democrat. Almost the odd fellow was Cary Grant, whose conservative stride reflects a majority of political feelings in Hollywood that has already slipped. But this was 1948: Communists were a real threat to knowing and the black was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activists would repeat in mainstream films, and then not so subtle.
