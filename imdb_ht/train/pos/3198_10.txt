This is how I felt while watching this movie. I loved it. It was hilarious. But I felt like I was getting sneaky looking at someone's psyche and then laughing as he was twisting around making an interesting point. A friend puts it on that road: <br /> "I feel like we broke someone's house and are now watching horrible videos at home without their knowledge". Another one of these facts is stranger than film fiction. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town that gets up to a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and it certainly does, though not, perhaps as it was initially expected. With high hopes of fame and significance he invited Harris to come up with a movie of a really terrible quest that he organized in his home town - underlined by his own acting drag "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br /> Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slow downstream story. Some feet in a little left want someone morphs, more than two subsequent reinterpretations, in the history of freedom of reproductive sexual identity in the small town of America. Harris simultaneously criticized the attitudes of small America, the cult of celebrities, and the OS practices in the film industry and television. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performance. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so well he follows the current 'Gary Foot,' but with strong nuances to push the sense of interaction in style Harris wants it to go. At the end of the original Gary's close-naked eye is what has moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> A movie does not miss. I have not seen anything else like it. <br /> Jacob.
