This is not just one of Jackie Chan's bigger films, but also one of the biggest Kung Fu fuels of all time. <br /> We've come to expect crazy, and fast, creative action in the Cinema Chan, and this one sets the benchmark for others to follow. It is two hours of entertainment, which impresses all the way through. <br /> As well as the superb action, we have a solid storyline with credible characters, and Chan takes what appears to be a more western approach to the writing, mixing Eastern resolution methods (ie kicking donkeys). In general, it's funny, serious, fun and inaugural. A must for any Kung Fu Fu, also at the same time staying accessible to the wider community of the movie community.
