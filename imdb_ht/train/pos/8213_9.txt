Any witnesses of our justice system - or lack thereof will get this movie really satisfying. There was not too much of gray-related characters or plots. Virtually every character in this film is the best and worst of our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have to deal with scumbags along with the envy-pambi, Lily-times-, mele-brushed bureaucracy that allows them to name " policy correctly ". <br /> <br /> The performance across the board was compelling. I am sympathized with victims of rape - while at the same, found it pleasurable to see it wiping the smug, greedy delusion on the faces of his former attackers. In particular, I found one of the ugliest characters in all the films I saw, so it was nice to see his former victim lock his mouth for good. The lead violet and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Harry's room itself officers in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. The only sequel to the legendary Harry Hall is equal to the first.
