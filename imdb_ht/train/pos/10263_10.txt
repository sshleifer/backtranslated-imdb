"House of Games" is an imposing film constructed, and one of the few films I've seen that has gaping me to the screen in wonder of how cunning and unexpectedly it ends. First, I saw it on video a few years after reading Roger Ebert's review, which has been proclaiming it the best movie in 1987. I had doubts, especially because it's not quite as well known as other films this year. Boy, I was in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, best-written movies I've ever seen. The creativity is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the carpet from beneath you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development . On my second look, I began to realize that Mamet's screenplay was successful not only as a smart suspension film but that each scheme development contributed to our understanding of the characters and motivations. The highest point of the film is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It naturally stems from what we know about the characters, and that is why more than just an arbitrary twist ends. Performance by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also adds enormously to the movie. I can not picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing Mike's role, and Crouse plays his role with just the right amount of constraints suggesting a criminal remedy attitude. Their work, Mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combines to create one of the greatest films in the 1980s. It's really a must-see.
