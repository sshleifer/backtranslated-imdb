Banknote as the story of Steve Biko - play excellent by Denzel Washington, as you would expect - this was actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. This was undoubtedly done in Kline as a serious actor, and it was amazingly good in the role. Attenborough gave this sort of direction you would expect, and the spectacularly spectacular scene of the masses was the sort of sort that only he can get through. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was competent enough and made a great job, at what ends up as a sad story story in a South Africa that is still nowhere near the distant past.
