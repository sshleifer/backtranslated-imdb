A haunting piece that fans of smart movies fans will fall off with gratitude. Keeping your Freddys and Your Jasons - This movie is in the same company as the "Haunted" (original). Lyric and truthful, it remains with you long in the night, much like those CBS Radio show Myster theater shows. A smart rent.
