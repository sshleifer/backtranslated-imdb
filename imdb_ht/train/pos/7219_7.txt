Unlike Tinseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY!, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's hit Broadway comedy could not wait for his step incarnation to fly before putting it on the silver screen, so producer wisely decided to make the most of it's long white way running! The opening scenes and closing of the movie shotgun movie theater boxes in New York where DEATHTRAP played for almost five years. Even the final fadeout film on the theater theater is a version of the famous logos stageplay. (Although Marketeers decided to go with a fun rubik's more fun cube for the movie.) <br /> Now on a low-cost DVD release, DEATHTRAP looks just as cool and coined as ever. The cast is just right (better than the scene scenes) and escort where should be applauded to find a spooky suitable home for our "one room, two actor actors" to take place in the open in surprisingly simple and innovative way , director Sidney Lumet wisely tagged all "new" materials on the start and end of the movie and Levin's leaf clumsy twisty center alone. The latest film scene is a great Hollywood stallion from the boards and slightly weakens one of Levin's point draws from earlier in the movie [Helga (on a dagger): "Will be used by another woman play. "]. Like Robert Altman of the Player, however, our new final helps the film to fold in on itself once again and scrolls the line between steps, screens, and (it may be?) Real Life!
