I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! It was my favorite army in the show but down. I hate glamorous gossip and generally gay talk show, but when Hal Sparks animates Soup Talk, he has to watch TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his run and was sad when the guest hosts began to pour in (although most of the guests always did a fine job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all those who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they should never see the weekend's specialists. They were hours long episodes of Talking Soups including the best clips throughout the week, and being padded from comic striped bits. The original bits that Hal Sparks made hilarious. In one he got owned by a fierce evil bad comedy, and in an exorcist like Scenery himself sharpened as he said joking dates on plane jets. One episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplication, as a bunch of clones Hal Sparks kept multiplying out the episode, on-the-go studio. <br /> OK, maybe these are not sound as funny when I describe them, but all I know is that besides Soup Talk, only the other two shows I've watched over the years were The Simpsons and Late After and Conan O'Brian. So, if you like the comedy studios of these shows, then you would probably like Spaghetti Stuff during the year Sparks. <br /> <br /> That said, Henson and Tyler were both great hosts as well. All three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedy in my opinion. Of course, year-round Tyler and guest stars, my interest in this show began to block, but every now and then I catch the Soup, the spiritual successor show, and be sure enough, the new army can bring some laughs very unexpected in the long time. <br /> OK, I was wasting enough time talking about a TV show that's not about the time again and on a channel that I generally despise. Go look something else!
