Basically, I love Verhoeven movie because of her movie, I enjoy a brilliant psycho-psycho story that I've seen before in the "basic instinct" .It is really a wonderful thriller I enjoyed very much. So it is obviously for me 'See this another movie Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction before his block buster hit the "Basic Instance" and for that I was very curious to watch that film and yeah, the movie has come true my expectation and expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Four Man" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama that is a bit confused for some audiences. The story of this film is about a gay writer called "Reve" (Crabbe), an alcoholic person who lives in his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him from a future crash. After the end of her lecture, she presented a seductive woman named "Christine", with a mysterious past she does not want to reveal.Reveal sex with her at her home as she is a boy. In the morning she looks His sexy image, the boyfriend's boyfriend's photo on his table, whom he met at the station. She is curious to meet her, saying Christine invited her to her house. <br /> <br /> This is it. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it is a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising! <br /> <br /> Especially, I like the character "Reve" which is brilliantly played by "Krabbe" I basically like acting it because as a gay person I am purely identifying with her character and yes I like her good face. I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven to make such a black comedy. br /> <br /> i missed this movie: 10 out of 10.
