This film is a masterpiece of a young woman during the war, and it really happens, not exactly as the movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by this film, the act and the story where my great love this movie because it's a true story it's giff me a feeling that I've got and I feel sorry for the ca rector that Maruschka Detmers is playing because who wants to end here this way life. I recommend that everyone has seen this movie, the special ones young and maid in learning something in this movie. This movie can be compared to the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the WW2.
