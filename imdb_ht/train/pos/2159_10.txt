First, there is no way of renewal to be as good, because the Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such an important part of this movie, as explained in the opening of the narration. It adds to the humor as well as the heat of this film. There are slaughter of different characters / personality characters. Each is part of making this wonderful movie. This film is filled with non-vulgar comedy in any way like most of today's "gross-out" comedies. But he can still have you laughed loudly. The fact is, in real life, you do not have a choice in which you work with or go to school with ... etc. This film truly emphasizes and shows that the good natural one can overcome the petty differences. Not to mention, it makes for a great sub-sketch and lots of humor. This is a dance story that actually has a story, and a good one. There are a few back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. Surely a well-written movie. The dance is great, too. I came to a fan of any movie and dancing in any sort, for that aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other and dance, in the fact that, it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in Japan society. Very recommended. <br /> 10 out of 10.
