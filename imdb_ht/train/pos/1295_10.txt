The book on which this film is based was excellent; It took a while to come to Stoke and Houellebecq's original style but once I understood the attitude behind the writing I was completely traced to the author's world of sadness. In fact, no books affect me very much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it elucidated my own personal fight and made worthless of my own struggle harder to accept. Surface Houellebecq is mastered by Harel and the hero's indifferent and indifference to a world that was rejected by him is perfectly described. This is a movie that unveils today's society for the modest man of all its horrors. Hopefully, things will change in the future but for the present we must accept the rat-race as shown in this movie. It's probably best that Harel or Houellebecq does not create a genius job like this again. One enough for anyone.
