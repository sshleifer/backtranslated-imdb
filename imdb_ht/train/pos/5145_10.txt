<br /> An old man works as a drop in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient and trying to get it out. <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most forgotten heads of the era of silence and a oddity in the history of Japanese movies. Long thought lost, found a print in the 70s with a music band added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. It might have been influenced by cabinet of limestone physician (director Kinugasa claiming that he never saw the German film). However it exceeds it in style and in its most compelling (and chilly) show of the inner mental state of the prisoners of asylum. To achieve this, the film makes use of every single single-purpose film technique available at the time: multiple displays and outward focus points of view, tilt angles, quick and slow motion, exposure lighting and superimposed among others. It is also a very complicated film to follow, as it has not received interpreting. The film opens with a mounting of rain shots striking windows in the hospital, shaking winds and thunderstorms. Put the weather metaphor into the mental condition of the patients and introduce one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sound produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frenzied, almost dense hypnosis dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaging in another dance, he watched the other prisoners. Multiple expositions of the dancer represent the patient's point of viewing and confused "seeing" in the world. These are just two examples of this amazing film trying to represent the subconscious patients and see in the "list" of the world. <br /> In three words to be seen.
