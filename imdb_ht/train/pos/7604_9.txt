SERI 1 <br /> <br /> As the UK hurried to launch the launch of the series 'Lost', one series (which just finished showing here) did not disappoint. <br /> A group of forty passengers struggling to face after plane crashes landed in a desert island. They pray for salvation. However, as the days turn in week and survivors explore the surrounding forest, they begin to wonder whether they are alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! But the series managed to pick himself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode. Perhaps the greatest thing about 'Lost' is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks. This gives us more insight and, hence, more suspension and excitement as the events unfold in the present. <br /> <br /> Finally, this show is a superb combination of drama, suspense and the supernatural; it is, simply, indisputable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> deep into the heart of the phenomenon which is the hatch. They discover a mysterious person who has a job to do. Meanwhile, Michael and Sawyer are fighting to cope with the consequences of what happened on the boat. As the series progresses, viewers will be able to bring themselves to the TV set, as each episode of the series has more twists than a Curly-Wurly chocolate bar, one of which introduces a whole host of new characters. With each mystery resolved with 'Lost', five new brands seem to come from the woods. After the 974th scheme twist of the series, it finally dawns about the viewer that it does not actually matter if the plan-crash survivors make it on the island. However, the stunning series final answers just over half of these questions, despite its anti-climatic ending.
