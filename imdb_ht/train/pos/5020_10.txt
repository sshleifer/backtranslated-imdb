This is what a movie should be when trying to take the sense of what is very surreal. It has this stem obstin that rarely captured on film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a haunted black memory. Kids were very credible and I expect some things from them in the future. Very natural acting for these genes, I do not know if Bill pulls it out of them or has just that good, but no less excellent. Bill notes as far as I'm concerned and commenting that KevNJeff about Mr. Paxton's bad act, what one can do in this role. He played the party rather well in my opinion. This will come from someone who told Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his Comments. Great cops make you feel really comfortable, if that's what you want? Camera has a higher average rating as well.
