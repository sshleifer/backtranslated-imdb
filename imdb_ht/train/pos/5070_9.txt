Recently I was looking for the new DVD Wide Screen Screen at FLY home tour and came on interesting titles that I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that he was a Richard Attenborough Film caught my attention (he is responsible for the fine films such as Gandhi, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the scenario was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" was full of interesting sonar material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I chanced it & bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan star as Archie Gray Owl, a real life trapper in the 1930s, who became the favorite and respected wild land in Canada, and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond movie) provided a bold, warm, powerful performance as Annie Galipeau as the girl who loves and influences his feelings for the animals in the country - especially the beaver. A fine note by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photography by Roger Pratt adds greatly to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extra expenses on this DVD is something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real gray Owl as well as Audi audio tracks by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine PLUS options for people accessing a PC and DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL has been released directly to the US DVD - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not charged with a lot of violence and gender. This is a movie that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm sentiment of the film conclusions - with a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.
