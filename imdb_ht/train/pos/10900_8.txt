This was a documentary for me to see when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to look at the repeat. I really liked the main character of the film, because, this is true, I have a mild condition of the skin problem, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes amusing and emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting vocal muscles) and never goes to growth, but it is 36 years old. Most sympathize moments to see his terrible condition, and pealing in his bandage. Jonny was quite a naughty sense of humor, she even told from beyond the tomb when showing her body in a coffin. She tells her story with her mother's help, Edna Kennedy, her older brother and her celebrity model, and Jonny's friend Nell McAndrew. He had the BAFTAs for Best Correct and Best New Director (Reality), and was nominated for the Best Sound (Reality) and Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 on the 100 TV Great TV Treaties 2004. A must see documentary!
