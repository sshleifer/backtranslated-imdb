I had a lot of experiences with women in Russia, and this movie shows that a lot of them are like, unfortunately. They are very clever, gracious, and vicious, as well as very dishonest. From the robotic gender, the hustle for gifts, lies and betrayal, I've experienced it all in Russia. <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here is my qualifications: Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of pics of many Russian hot girls I met, black comedies, scams I was screaming, and the story of my mugging and appearance on national television Russia. <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> It's like TV reality. You will love it. I spent a ton of time putting it together. So check it out. Russian women Nicole Kidman plays a lot like Julia and Katya in my photojournals. 3 brides seeking travel in Russia happen to be very interesting and would sell, so why not make a movie out of my bride is seeking adventures in Russia? However, there is one real impossible in this movie, and that's the way the guy orders his bride from a catalog and has it arriving at an airport. It does not work at all, so I do not understand why the media likes to perpetuate it. There is not one single Russian web-based introduction that works in this way, and I challenge anyone who gets one that does. The fact is, you can only provide CONTACT contact to Russian checkers (email, address, phone number, etc.) to the website. From there, you match and then visit it, and if you want to bring it to your country, you begin the immigration process at your INS office, and wait a month later. That's how it works in real life. You can not just order to arrive at your airport. US immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got all that I wanted to go abroad!
