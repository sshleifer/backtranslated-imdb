Anyone who finds this boring film is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to movies chasing cars and romantic comedy. This movie is fixed and does not have a boring moment. Why? Because it is largely composed of intelligent dialogue between real people at a time of crisis and detail efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is characterized by nearly all of Rohmer's films, and that is why many people do not like them. They prefer actions. Fine, let's spend the rest of their lives watching movie action, while those of you who have tastes and discriminations will continue looking for movies like this. Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky." Well, it is, but me that's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare spoke, too. Is there a talkier play than "Hamlet?" Each time the subject, or term, to a work of art consists of ideas and conflict of value, must have in need a discussion of the ideas and values, which is largely what this movie is all about. Aristocracy and nobility births against equalitarianism; The loyalty of old friends who put in the ultimate test when this friend takes what we believe to be an evil path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save this life, even if people who own this life are not good, or even despicable. (Anyone ever heard in Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and punishment?") These are what this film is all about. <br /> <br /> The two leading of this movie are impeccable, as if they were designed to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as her second language, is especially brilliant. Make yourself a favor and see this sling film. It can be the latest movie by this Screen Master.
