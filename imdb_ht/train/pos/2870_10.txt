This movie is wonderful. He always was still. I mean really what's best then a housewife falls in love. Walt really went out to head out here. And the music! A dream is a pleasure your heart is beautiful! What else can you say besides terrific! I can not wait until the special edition out it will be so awesome! I can not wait to hear all the songs that have been erased. This movie is so beautiful and clever! It is beautiful. What about the cute mice too! I know I keep saying the same things over and over and over yet but this is a great movie! Woods was terrific in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
