"Coast Shore" is mostly an average Star trek adventure. There is nothing wrong with the episode, though. I simply think this is not the best representation of what the show has to offer for their fans. It is lightweight fun, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that a television show of this kind had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decided to give his crew some time, and a landing party bounced down to a planet that looks good for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. There are some actions and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughing. Well, but unexceptional.
