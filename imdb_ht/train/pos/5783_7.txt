I've read reviews of Kerching on IMDb, and honestly, I have not seen a positive review until now. I actually love Kerching. Kerching is about a boy called Taj Lewis, so he can make Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother and put a website called rudeboy. The website offers lots of interesting things, if only Taj, and her two friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj from getting exposed. I find this show quite funny and I love watching it. The act is O.K., but it can definitely be the best, funny characters, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his sort is what makes him funny. and other Taj's friends Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the coffee called "The Chill." We have never seen him, we just heard him. The youngest Taj brother, Omar and his older missy Missy are also funny. And Missy's best friend Kareesha. So many times the Taj almost raised exposure, almost. As well as the comedy, the Kerching drama like love life and the loss of loved ones make this program great.
