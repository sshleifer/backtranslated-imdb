Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday night drama shows in a long time. I asked the writer to write a long series and when he was lifetime, SOON. Everybody was very interesting and did a wonderful thing with the lines the plot has come true. However, the movie needs to continue for a long time. I would like to see Bianca and Jake's child grow up and get a bigger part of the movie, as well as new grandparents plan for her future education. Also, bring kathy back to her niece and help promote her life. She was great to see grandparents working out the issues, but the family business needs to be restored to working conditions, and let's see how Jake and Bianca survive in marriage the year.
