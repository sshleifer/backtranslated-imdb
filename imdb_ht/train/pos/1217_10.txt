I was worried that my daughter could get the wrong idea. I think the "black-heart" character is a little bit on the rough side and I do not like the way it shapes-shifts to a "mean" frog, fox, boy ?? I was wrong, This movie was made for my kid, not for me. He "gets it" when he goes on (under?) My head. Of course I do not "get it". This is not one of the new kids films that the adults will also enjoy. This is just for the youth, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political junk ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, nobody has access to excess, and everyone is unhappy all the time. And as a side benefit, nobody has! ... want.
