I have read the other reviews and found some to be the comparison of real life v vices (eg what it takes to get to music school), Britney bashing, etc., etc. to let's focus on the movie and the message. > <br /> I've rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For male adult men .... 2 out of 10. <br /> I love pop / rock music, i 45. i know of britney spears, but never realized it actually sings stronger until i read credit and review them. I did not recognize his poster on the wall so I was not worried about any 'self promotion'. <br /> I watch movies to be entertained. I do not care about casting, lighting, producer, director, etc. What is the movie and he amused me. <br /> I watch this movie for the message. The world's greatest epidemic is low self esteem (which is another story) so look with the message in mind, as this is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and brittle, good for kids. I found the Texan twain they began to fade into the movie and of course there are only so many ways to transmit the given / by giving up messages, so it was a bit predictable. Huge message if ... there should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but for a blocking watching herself, get Hannibal.
