Remember the band, which is played out by now. <br /> <br /> Still, Debra Winger is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her, she is quite good as Cissy, girls from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in Trailer and Bud, (Travolta), only to be replaced for a time by Slicker Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> I agree with an earlier review regarding Scott Glenn, it's used for scheme only, dropping into the mix to create suspense; The story is predictable and optimally. <br /> Also, though I'm from the east, many of us did not like "Monday Night Fever", while having her moments, stereotypes are ever beyond criticism at this point . <br /> Worth Saw for Debra Winger; It is still so likable, and never had that Hollywood character we are subjected to many actresses today. 7/10
