Brilliant movie, the next best drummer Master (Jackie Chan) movie. I recently bought it on an original VHS and I did not see this film for 15 years but still good as it was back then. The act was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it features those that make this movie (and many other old fashioned Chinese kung-fu films) great. The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic. I never saw the 36th room of Chaolin, but knowing it is the same movie but Gordon Liu plays San tea but San was in Thr Back to the 36th room played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant Kung Fu.
