This alleged-go-lucky swashbuckler 1939, based rather on wounds on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel "The Three Soldiers," qualifies as the first-rate entertainment of the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s . Cary Grant delivers more hit-on-the-neck and knuckled-up points than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in India, this six-fisted wire remains on the exploits of three reliable British and native Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) waters that are sustained by an independent cult of the Indian murder of the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter, Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of the "Informer"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in "Dawn Patrol"), is a competitive trio of Hard-drinking, hard-to-reach, and fun-loving Alpha-aged youngsters are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the business. Of course, Knife and MacChesney drums up the assorted schemes to distract the Ballentine. When the superiors order them back to action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote in the "Sheik out" steps), Cutter and MacChesney Higginbotham drugs so that she can not accompany them and Ballantine has replaced her. Half of the fun here watching principals are trying to spend each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and dimensions like our hero melee with a host of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his black and white exception.
