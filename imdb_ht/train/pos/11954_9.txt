Great movie, enough laugh and action for any audience. <br /> Since the last person posted on this movie took it on the head called Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the movie, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows an easy duo, Johansson and Allen, as they follow a tip given by ghosts of an English reporter recently dead. Research takes them to the house of the killer, and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. But do not let the plot fool you, the movie really is hilarious and the act is superb. It seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to do some of the most imaginative jobs in their respective careers. Also, from watching the movie to a park tect, you can just say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback. The second he walked on the bright screen audience. There's just something about the man and it really shines through scoops. <br /> Check it out, it's worth the trip.
