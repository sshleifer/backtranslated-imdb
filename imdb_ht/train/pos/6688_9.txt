In the history of movies based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated ones. This is not the regular film movie superhero! He followed the explosions of a motley crew of well-known wolverines, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Sparrow la (Paul Reubens). "Men's Mystery" parody several aspects of superhero movies such as "Superman" or "Batman," such as the pithy words, and the questions about secret identity. Most of the superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types and menial jobs and neurotic home life. So it looks as if the director of Kinka Usher will make the heroes of something the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Hand" to be visually interesting and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to look!
