Nifty little episode played mostly for laughs, but with smart doll in suspense. Somehow a Martian snuck aboard a broken-down bus on his way nowhere, but that passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrant!). All-star supporting cast, from wild non-Eye Jack Elam (hamming up lacquered), sexy Jean Willes (if it's the Martian, then I say let's open the borders!), Mechan- facing John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), with familiar figures John Archer and Barney Phillips (with a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver). Make for a very fun half hour even if the action is imprisoned in a single set.
