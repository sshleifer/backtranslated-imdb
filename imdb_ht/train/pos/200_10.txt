Update from a previous comment. Marion Davies is great and underrated shows his comedy stuff in this late 1928 comedy silence that also shows William Haines wonderful. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashed Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit bit of bit comedy. They appear together in cheap comedy until Marion is "discovering" and becoming a great dramatic star. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines is a wonderful team, and the shots are invited to love at Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor , Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you will see it) is a hood. A must for any big movie movie or anyone interested in Marion Davies are still-maligned! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the person who binds the leader. They were told that Gloria Swanson's career was used as her model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this story the parallel film rises in Swanson from one Mack Sennett comedy and Charlie Chaplin STAR in Cecil B. DeMille the late youth and early 20s. Davies and Haines were MGM big stars and friends. Odd that MGM never associates up in a talkie. They are great together! A sweet romance and delightful parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Babies Daniels mentioned, but did not appear.
