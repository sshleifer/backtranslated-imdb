This is an excellent start to film career in Mickey Rooney. Her talent here shows that a long career ahead of her. Vehicles and trucks drifting are interesting for the 1937 era. This starts in the series Andy Hardy is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual. Please Mr Rooney or owner of their movie rights, take a chance and get this product on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
