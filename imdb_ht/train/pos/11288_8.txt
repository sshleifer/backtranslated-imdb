Considered by almost all the critics to be best in the movie Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan, I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of other people I thought just as fun. One thing: it's long in the range that I saw in 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them but this was longer than I used to and with the final draw-out action I thought the whole thing was a bit too long. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good mix of action, suspense and romance. The missing items are color and sound stereo. Primitive special-effects do not bother me, as all of these were back in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this is the most filmed for one thing: skin! "Jane" has never put anything of this chimpy following this movie as the Hays Code was established by the time the next film was Tarzan made. His outfit showed that a great figure was owned by Maureen O'Sullivan. Underwater scenes, however, did not read - not a longshot. The woman under the water did not have a good face at all, regardless of what she was. There are many actions in here. Until the end, it was not over, either. The finish went on for 15 minutes, though, and was so intense that it was too much to look. <br /> Always, this movie offers everything - except "boy" (adopted the son) - you would want to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan performing Tarzan and calling a dozen times . With her fear of "lungs," there was no problem.
