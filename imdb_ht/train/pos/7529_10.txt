Last year and especially everyone looks different, some for good and some are getting worse. I still enjoy as much as I did the original though .. Some flaws were even though such as changing the Joker it now has no red lips and looks like more naked hair with black students, hes still voiced by Mark Hamill is a plus I guess. Ivy more white poisoned that he will become more like a plant and chatwomen looks much different and not as "attractive" as it was in the original. Even though suits like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Killer and Scarecrow look badass, especially scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work as alone as it used to. Most of the time working with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue often. Batman gave up the yellow logo with the black wing on his costume and looks like he got a bit bigger but still kicks tons of ass. The show is not as original as the original because of some of the characters removed but the stories are as interesting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" might be one of the greatest Batman episodes ever to make sure you check out. <br /> <br /> Overall 8-9 / 10
