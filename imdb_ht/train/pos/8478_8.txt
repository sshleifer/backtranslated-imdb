I saw this film as a child and he broke my heart! No other story was like an ending finish ... I grew up on many great animated movies and this was one of my favorites, because it was so unusual - a story about injustice, and cruelty, and loneliness, and life , and choices that can not disappear, and the need for others. Chirin is made by himself when Wolf kills his mother, but Wolf is alone, too, when Chirin follows him in the mountain. Wolf does not kill the lamb, though every night says "maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The tape in it I have is broken and degraded from age and use. I will fix it and watch the movie again a day and cry just as hard as I did as a kid. History like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complicated in meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I never encounter any more catharsis. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
