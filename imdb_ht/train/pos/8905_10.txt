Old horror films are interesting, lots of screams, lots of screams, and lots of humor are going along with it. The "Pate" is a classic of his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to make a hero in his city. Going on a date with her girl is rather typical for all teenagers. But when the old man discovered the same thing falling heaven's shape, he ended up being the victim, and Steve helped him out the best he could. When she gets into teenage power, this movie really gives it. I know that most youths have had difficulty when they act, when dangers come around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing good to save humanity. When adults in the city have finished learning difficult times on "Pate", they must learn to trust their youth and do not let their behaviors get the best of them. Juggernaut oozing was rather nice in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone faced in suspending the threat, the city is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. I always eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOW! RATING 5 STARS
