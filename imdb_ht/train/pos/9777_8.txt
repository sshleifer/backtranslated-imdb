one of the best budget low movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new age? If you believe in esoteric, please do not watch this movie! It blows all your positive imagination. This film shows that beyond the peaceful fa√ßade of spiritual souls lies a world of extreme and fear of transgression. I hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon! Andreas Marschall's first film is only the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
