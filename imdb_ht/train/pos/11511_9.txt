Weak scripts at times? Yep! Cheesy special effects at liver? Yep! Deliciously culinary pleasure most of the time? Yep! More About Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I still enjoy science fiction as a kid but found many of the things Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / Terror as just crap. It took Abbott and Costello for me a new perspective on the classic Universal Monsters, and took Carl Kolchak to win me on the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke was Cogburn's cock, Eastwood was dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck was Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixing in with all these weak scripts, featuring special effects, which Baroque group of supported characters and actors and guest stars, was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. It has a sense of humor in spite of the danger, was an idealist in pursuit of the truth, and a realist when it comes to accepting the incompetence required and eventually covered-up by government officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak wanted to beat his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant breaking it, at the end of his journalist career, or prison time. For all his mistakes, including no taste in clothing, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and understanding who drove a pretty classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car at the moment) on his way to save the day for mankind. As good as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak, the hero was virtually brought to life every week for one season Darren McGavin. Now that he's been over and shows he's on DVD, I hope he has so much fun watching me watching him have fun playing Kolchak Night Stalker's all over again!
