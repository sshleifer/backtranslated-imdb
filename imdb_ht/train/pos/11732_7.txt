OK, I saw this in the theaters when it came out and I do not know why. I have not seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this movie - yet I do not know why. But the fact that I remember talking to traders. <br /> <br /> Comedy is tough - much harder than any drama. Do it right to make it seem easy, but to do it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you are falling into this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress in the dark must have made it good for me to remember this loving movie. Make at a speed, speed and tongue in a cheek and know it by the Philedelphia story, it's fun to start finishing. Brain donors are another that suits rights in this category (meaning most of the free scratches jokes). A point of debate - the ending. It seems the writers / directors had no idea how to finish a comedy. The finish is trying to make a love story, a bit fast-paced dialogue that occurs at this point. Then there is the scene "tassle". While this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over the head and out of place to such a trauma. One more rewrite for the finish was needed. <br /> This is not comedy geniuses like Carpets or Spinach or the Producers or the Holy Grail. But if you do not try to excuse it and just let the puns and fun fun come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.
