There are enough sad stories about women and asthma by religion, politics and society. By reducing the films and stories about genital mutilations and reproductive rights, as well as wages inequality, and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach with some flow light on the subject. The environment is matched in 2006 between Iran and Bahrain qualifying for the World Cup. Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men can get in the game. <br /> <br /> The women kept (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani, and Mahnaz Zabihi) and arrested for prosecution gave a humorous and explicit appetite to the land customs this, and, most likely, all Muslim countries. The interactions with the Iranian soldiers who were watched and transported, both the towns and villages, and the father who was looking for her daughter to give some hilarious moments as we thought about why these rules were unknown. She is mostly about a partnering society that feels she has to save her to the size of her male size. Instead of educating the male population, they deny women's privilege and rights. <br /> <br /> See the changes in the soldiers responsible with the reflection of Iranian society, it is our surprise this movie will not find any play in Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hand for those who can see it.
