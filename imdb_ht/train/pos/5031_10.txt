This movie is very well done! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the series, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission. Paxton is at its best in this role. Its mockery, the infections used in its tone without moving. Every delicate shot does! Surprise turns one after another when the film reaches its first hour. This can not be the best picture of the year, but it's a very polished gem. It's not for yourself simple.
