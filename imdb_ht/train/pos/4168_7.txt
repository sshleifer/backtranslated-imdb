Not only this movie has one of the great movie titles, it's the third sports crew of actresses 70s Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember this movie being released Halloween week back to '78 going against Linda Blair at Stranger in our home. I missed it on the first run chosen to see the other movie. And on repeat, I saw I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but really miss any thrills or surprises. Although I did like the scene where Richard Crenna launched the dog's family to no avail.
