I was waiting for a long time to film a faithful version of H. G. Wells' Classic novel, "War of the Worlds". Timothy Hines has finally done it! I just could not believe how good it was! From acting, in costume, from this world to special effects, I just can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performance by a top-notch cast! It happened to be seen to be believed. I'm sure you did not. And I read all those negative comments by others, and they can not believe what they said. We must have watched a different movie, huh? And these people are bad comments not that guy vepsaian, guy who he is, well, he just does not know what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> Hold the good job, Mr. Hines.
