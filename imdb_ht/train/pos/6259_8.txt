I'm actually outraged in the comment I read stating that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was dirty by the black and white feet. Born in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible for her when! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people went through is utterly remarkable. It took them a week just to cross a river. The women brought their children to big wooden bowls on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like to see anybody doing this right now! <br /> I think it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing shots and an incredible story.
