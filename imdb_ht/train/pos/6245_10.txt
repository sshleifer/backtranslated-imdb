"Hundstage" is the first film seam film (before he directed large documentaries as "love animals" or "patterns"). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years but it only cost about 2 million dollars. Actors are very good especially to non-professional actors who almost played themselves. The movie is also good. The whole movie is shocking disturbing and some scenes can be too much for the "ordinary" viewers.the movie shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and can not communicate with each other. Finally I said that this is one of the best and most rewarding movies in the last few years. please excuse me wrong English. <br /> <br />
