On the basis of the preview I would see, I went to "showers" awaiting a sweet little comedy; what I found was a profoundly touched family life drama said in some of my most lush photographic images I had ever been privileged to see. In addition, later reflections made me appreciate the cuts off of the past stage (in the arid land of Northern China, and in the high plain of Tibet): is not that how memory often works? A moment I'm here, the next I'm in the landscape of the past, just like that .... <br /> I would not only recommend this movie, I'd put it in the middle of the movie or three The finest I saw in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago another Asian comedy was released in the United States as "Are We Dance?" (Japanese). As with "showers," glimpses do not give the slightest indication to the depth of this movie, which has come back from a subtle psychological study (albeit full trauma in funny moments). Is there a pair, on the part of distributors, to make films appear too "important" or "deep" to appeal to watch American TV?
