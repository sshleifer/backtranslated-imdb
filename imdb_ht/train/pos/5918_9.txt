One of the most interesting movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text with wonderful insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Scratcher and Barry White, who appeared in the movie as well. The racist image can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the NAACP gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly). I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a test in the pervading atmosphere of racism that Bakshi tries to deconstruct. Wonderful thing.
