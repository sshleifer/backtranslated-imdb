"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's great fun, and accessible to many audiences. The original film could be beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke replicates his signature Broadway role, but instead they tinkered with the draw, so the movie is very satisfying. This re-do, which is revealed on ABC in 1995, is far more faithful to the original script, and includes some original songs as well as being used on a national tour that this movie has taken away from that Tommy's star Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this movie.) Jason Alexander is a very different type of Dick Van Dyke, but he threw himself as Albert, (before his "Seinfeld" days, he began in musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. They are also great works at Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (a role played on the national tour). This movie is not as smooth as though. A great responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, however appealing, simply resembles too old looks to be young Kim. And George Wendt is a bit swollen like his father, sending a few "children" numbers (a member of the original cast by Paul Lynde stole the show with.) But all in all, this is a delightful , well done the movie that the material deserves.
