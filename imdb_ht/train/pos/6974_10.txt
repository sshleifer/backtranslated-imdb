I recently looked up Caprica again and thought I might as well come up and write a review! I saw this first right after I saw the final series of Battlestar Galactica (When a great fan of drooling boy in the show left me holding on anything I could in the universe shows) so I did not know what to expect ... but I've come out with a smile even though I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> The story starts off dramatically on the caprica planet and we are presented with a variety of interesting characters. .. I will not give too much attention, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but I suggest you look at this. <br /> <br /> You must say ... Esai Morales is one hell of an actor pulling off a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his place to act on me and I could believe he was the father of William Adama from BSG ... <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz adapted his role precisely. ..! Remember it was good to see Polly Walker out of Rome! Do not sit and watch Caprica and wait for it as Battlestar Galactica because the story line is beautiful right ahead and anyone can watch it..without seeing BSG! is a well-written drama for those who love drama and a bit of a sci-fi kick!
