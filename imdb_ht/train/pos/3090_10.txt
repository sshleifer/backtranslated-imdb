I am angry that ABC will give up yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and scenario were great, an original original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us sharing the whole idea of ​​"connection". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those who were only in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). Acting with characters is so easy to love and so talented !! I wish ABC gave this show more of a chance, and not cut Midway's show, and it was not published enough. Surprisingly !! for everyone !! This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep that show alive. Please join me and I know we can do it. He worked for Jerico. (By the way where is Episode 13? I want the latest show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is well worth it !!! PETITION ON INTERNET TO SAG SEG DEGREES: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html YOU CAN DO IT !! SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP !!!
