Victor Nunez imbues this inconsistent story of the emotional youth journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in movies. By poetry I mean the essence of that literary and the cinemas go into play. There is a very literary thing about the movie, almost as if a novel has been matched to the page by the screen. In this regard, the film achieved so much depth can not; but it is also rather slow in other times, its depth calculations once realized in favor of annui. Star star Ashley Judd has not yet made a movie much better than her first here. It fits Ruby lead role as a glove, almost as if it did not have to act. She had the true movie star presence in the film, and she was not really managing to transmit the same to later films, although she was impressive in normal life.
