These are one of the movies that does not require any brain or thought, it's a very funny time pass that you forget about the next hour or so. I was really surprised by Jan Abraham's act he usually plays the gangster as the character and emotional figure, so from which to play the complete opposite and to do it successfully, does not manage to shine amongst the funny geniuses like Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also very surprised by the girl 3 Akshaye because the role did not require a lot of talent, but mostly weighed on the Akshaye's dissipation (in the other girls) I was amazed as they managed to establish and current characters and you could differentiate between And that's a good thing, too, the majority of the good songs, it's colorful and fun so on either Sunday night this will ensure lighten your mood.
