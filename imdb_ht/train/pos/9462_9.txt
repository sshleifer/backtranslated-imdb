Clean family oriented films. I laughed, I called ... I loved it. I was worried I could not see Steve Carrell as anything but Michael's back from the office. Boy, I was wrong. He should have an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and not in this "kind of movie" movie. I saw her with 2 other couples in the 30 year old series and we all agreed she was the best movie we've seen in a long and certainly the cleanest time. Only 1 word word! Not even though it was PG13. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
