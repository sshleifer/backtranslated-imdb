This movie is far better than the original Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves original humor. We have incorporated nearly many lines from this film in our daytime speech as we have at Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table and distract it for turtle soup. The original Jerk was too choreographed on stage scenes. While I love Steve Martin, it looks like he's trying hard. The Hyper Jerk is a parody and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Hyper is friendly family unlike the original Jerk.
