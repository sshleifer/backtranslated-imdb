Che: Part One was a fascinating experience, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but she also tried to do something different with the genre of "biopic": Part Two is excellent accumulation of this experience. <br /> This film offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (especially in Benicio del Toro) toward the brilliant Steven Soderbergh, without forgeting its intentions of crushing and the conventional rules from biopic. That's what I admire from Soderbergh's experience ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and succeed most of the times. <br /> <br /> The final message of this movie is perfect, and it includes whatever we have said about Guerrara's life. This only fails I find on Che: Part Two is that part Some felt a bit irrelevant. <br /> In summary, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation, because, as one of the first, it is a brave and immeasurable experience that challenges the spectator and leaves we think.
