Absolutely the very first movie that scares me to death. I had to catch it when my older brother (r.i.p.) looked at her. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good picture but it was my interest. Shortly after, as I bought a set of colors and, as luck would have it, the movie million showed him one Sunday. <br /> I've forgotten most of the scheme, but it did not take time to catch up ... and I got so scary I had a hard time sleeping this night! I mean it was just a movie but it involves an animal that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it ... and once it was caught in you it was too late. Even now, after all this time it still throws a wavy up my spine. A true classic, and even better a classic that I saw scare the pants into a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live the blob!
