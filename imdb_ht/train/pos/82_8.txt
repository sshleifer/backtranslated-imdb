Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans (most likely all baby boomers grow in late 50's and 60's), three actors / actress actors appear when performing for reunion show, in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter. As fun as he saw Luke, Sugar-Babe, and Pepino together again, it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? It is my understanding that Little Luke has passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information about Hassie online, that I can find. Very curious why not even mentioned? It was so obvious, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspected that the family of Michael and Lydia himself (if still alive) either, 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and that's why the desires were granted , or 2) TNN could not find any trace of either Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to let them out of the conversation altogether. Otherwise, the retrospective on Walter Brennen was nice to do. They do not bother him ... he's father who made the show such a success. I remember, as a kid, mimicking the dad's gimp market and my parents laugh (as I'm sure one million other kids have done back then). An annoyance that bothered me was a tendency for Richard Crenna to dominate discussions ... at times interrupting Tony and Kathleen for making a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed to be completely able to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak out and say too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I watched her several times on DVD and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
