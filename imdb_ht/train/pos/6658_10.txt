Mahatma was depicted as a man who neglected her son in this movie. Do not get me wrong I do not condemn the movie; It is such a wonderful movie and walk out of the movie with a ball in my throat. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual standing, a true spiritual leader. Only a completely enlightened man can possibly detach himself from his loved ones. A man with these calves leads his family with followers, for example. According to the film, she talked to her son and tried to make her understand where she was coming out, but poor Harilall and those little intelligence could not understand her dad. When things were wrong with Harilall, Mahatma was able to stay calm and accept that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> Was it any other parent, they would compromise their value to help the child get on his feet. Mahatma did not, it is true leader leading by example.
