This film seized me in a great way. Out of the box I got the impression that it was a comedy action but it was too funny to be a thriller, though it was a bit interesting. There's a lot of nice one-Matter that with funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, doing a great job. The rest of the cast is not half bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. The story can be very confusing at times as new characters show up during the movie. Things get more complicated as nobody rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention anything can get a bit dirty to the end, but I really like it. Louis Morneau is not all that well known, but he did a perfectly OK work with this one and I never really grow impatiently while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Made man is well worth the power.
