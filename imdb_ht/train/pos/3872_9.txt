After you saw this small and humorous movie, you'll be sure to feel better. The pleasure of Yves B. Pelletier was held at the moment this magnificent film, which, according to me, will be recognized as a film in 2004 marks for the Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon all deliver a touch of performance. I would like to compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you the Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain to me. So, if you were like the Jean-Pierre Jeunet films, I would say that you should also love the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
