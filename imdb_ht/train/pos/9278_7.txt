In the white balloons and Crimson Gold, the two other films by Jafar Panahi that I saw, the director mines surprised the depth of the similar subjects, on the surface, slight. Within the space of the Romanyan Panahi's valuable gifts to Iranian women are standing for their rights, I do not think it is as successful. Is not it said it does not matter, of course (and it's too bad that, as pretty much all other panahi films, Iranian can not see it). But after a while, the movie feels a tad of flattening, and it feels it long in 90 minutes. Do not say I did not like it, though. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. But it's not an important task, in my opinion.
