There were times when this film seemed to find a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be, but I guess this is part of his charm. Detective Philo Vance power of observation seems to be greater than all the Oriental sluchs of the era combined when it comes down to the final assessment of how the murders were committed. Throwing the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, could not someone just fall it? Vance (William Powell) had an early line in the movie about the 'Archer Coe' psychologically impossible to kill himself - I thought about it for a while. I was wondering if there are some scientific bases in fact so that the concepts to be true, have not studied my self psychology. Often logical, but then there are always cases that do not fit the rules. <br /> You know, I got a kick out of the hustle chorus (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. Dr. Star. The McCoy couple once said "I'm a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". I can picture DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and she says to herself - 'I'll have to use that sometime'. <br /> <br /> Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise, but until until then it is really anyone to guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film did not answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's Ghillie?
