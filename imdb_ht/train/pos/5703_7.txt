I'm a fan of crash and lash runner and this movie explores some of these highway highways and 80s movie noir theme that I like to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Overall though, the essential essence of the movie noir protagonist does not pull in properly by the female lead and her hero is almost a neanderthal, hence the kitch warning.
