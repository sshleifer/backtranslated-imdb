This movie was really eye-opening. I saw this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is transmitting is for everyone to wake up and not make mistakes in leaving God out of everyday life Our day or just plain will be his extra mileage. A great movie for those who do not believe in believers alike!
