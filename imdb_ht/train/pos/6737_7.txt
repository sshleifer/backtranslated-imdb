The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were stuck for this solid policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who gets a cop to cut off all ties with the past, but he can not keep inherited violent ways of checking They are interviewed suspects, and, One night, it goes too far; Gene Tierney is the wife of her victim, a decorated war hero who became involved with the city's leading racketeer and the Noise Andrews' nemesis 1, Gary Merrill (who was headquartered by Andrews Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted film with a series of credible opening exceptions and enlivened by a good cast including Charles Malden (as Andrews' incredibly superior), Tom Tully (as dadney's mouth-father dad father) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's Thug chief), with remarkable support also coming from Craig Stevens (as the victim, victim-beaten), Bert Freed (as Andrews' sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as bra Andrews outgoing superior). When you have already been warned by the letter of ways to deny ways or others, Andrews panic and imitate Stevens for a couple of hours after his murders put the police on the (in this case) malicious trains in Merrill; However, after Tully becomes suspicious of the prime (by which Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the cop goes to his head in Merrill's lair completely intelligence to get off with the racketeer 'frame to kill his own! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character with Andrews arise in the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the style of Fox noir home.
