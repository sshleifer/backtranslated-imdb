I even totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the week goes by to see the next show. it's a great storyline and has the best actors and actresses on the show. I will tune in weekly to watch it though I am not at home I still have vcr I put in cove monastic tape. Simon Rex is the best actor on the show. It is thrilling and exciting. I think this show should be on the air and I believe everybody should tune in to watch it. I saw the very first episode and actually I was not going to watch it but I was watching all life one day and I decided to watch it because it was over and I absolutely loved it and now it's p love me. I really mean it.
