One of the biggest hits in 1926, Brown's Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama feature rgatta and football scene that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a big star. He patches Haines along the way: clever brick alike that takes nothing serious until it is dismissed by everyone who arises and gets a man / hero and wins the girl. No one has worked this formula like Haines. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney and Mary Pickford, Show Marion Davies), Haines could swing from comedy tragedy and a change in facial expressions. It's a total joy in this movie as it was said to be in the Navy (and Lon Chaney) with West Point (and Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is a good thing like the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sick kolocation, Ralph Bushman is his rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton co-stars. This film was noted right now for its homoerotic relationships between Haines and Pickford and being John Wayne's first film as a Yale football player (but I never spotted him). Haines was a five-five box office star starting with this picture in 1932. It's a shame he has been widely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost. He was one of the most appealing and talented actors in his time.
