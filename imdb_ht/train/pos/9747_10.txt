I remember seeing this movie when she first came from 1982 & loved it then. About 4 years later, I had the privilege to see Luciano Pavarotti singing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca) to see this movie end up reminiscent of that great night. What does not like about this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at its best and still looks great. The story is actually very funny in the party & scene of 'fighting battle' is still one of the funnels I have ever seen. Fly into hot balloons when the Napa Valley was beautiful ... So the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti was singing in English). And hear the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous. Find genuine, this was a movie about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be playing by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in supporting them. <br /> I am so happy that I still have this VHS tape proposed from this movie but I would like this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is not with us because I think this includes The best performance at Nessun Dorma sings by her still on film today!
