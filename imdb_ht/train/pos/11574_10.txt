This movie is a half documentary ... and it's very exciting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of allegedly Norwegian managed to stop the heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and the rescue of the rest of the heavy water in Germany. This movie is not perfect and it could be a bit better ... The best part of the movie is that some of the sabots are played by themselves !!! <br /> If you are interested in stories of WWII and this movie is a movie that's worth a look !!
