I'm surprised not to have one thought of making a movie like this before. Horror is often more effective when it uses real-life unpleasant lives as a theme. And nobody (except for Steve Martin in the Little Store of Horror) loves to visit the dentist. Dental diseases were first performed (see the Marathan Man for example), but this brought the horror of suburbia. The draw revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who went down to Madness. Now, my dear doctor did not play with a full pile to start with, but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder she began to reject havoc on those around her. The spiral mental health doctors are just as close to what we see from Michele Douglas's character in Falling Down, but with a horror corner. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing by Stuart Gordon Stalwarts and Brian Yuzna, it's witty and has a great flow. Also featuring a cop, Ken Foree is always welcome. <br /> Now I believe that this movie would not work without absolutely fantastic performance from Corbin Bernsen. Having really only seen her in the law before, I was hauled away by his acting. The end of the Dentist 2 is also worth seeing, but slightly under par with the original. <br /> <br> Bottomline TTKK - A fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe, capped (pun intended) by a great performance from Bernsen
