I do not think I need to tell you the story. To say for years and years. So I'll just share my feelings. I saw first Cinderella was when I was five years old. Since then I've been a Disney kids in a great way. The animation now looks ancient and old fashioned, but this is part of its charm now. Now, at the age of high school music and computer generated images, it looks like people have forgotten the genius and magic sense of Disney's early movies. Fortunately I was born before so I presented this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back at that five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.
