When an actor has played the role of an actor, fictional or reality, the task becomes more difficult than playing a role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured personality personality. He puts in all his talent and sincerity. The visual expressions, manisms, marches and positions spoke eloquently to what Anthony Jan went on while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did very well that a Shakespearean actor in the short scenes as Othello belonged to this gem in a movie. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by skepticism about the loyalty of Desdemona were at the scene's top view.Add with that, character's character desperation and only someone with Coleman's depth of perceptive acting can be achieved. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much more profound and intense. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed Ronald Coleman liked his role in this movie above all others he played and went to win the Oscar for Best Actress in 1947. I'd see this movie repeat and never felt bored.
