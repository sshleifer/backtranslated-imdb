_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a plot against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they are used to be, but a pay stunning tax of French actors and movies. Supported by a solid reflection on movies and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, playing or playing), the story of this movie in which most of these famous actors play their own roles (not to be mixed and living their lives in front of the camera - the movie is not whimsical) is quite vague, and follow the actors in series of episodes that make the movie quite fun. As Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her part (great actress, it's hilariously serious especially when, in the role of Dussolier, she's chic on her head), as actors running in each other on the street, asking for Autographs, as battles and gosipes occur, we recognize the pasticle of the other scene that each (or else) played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for those who do not know the actors (most of them being at least in the 50s) or do not know French movies, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be missed, but it will always offer a good track of reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
