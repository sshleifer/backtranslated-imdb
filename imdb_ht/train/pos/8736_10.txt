You will be amazed at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the gift probably will not be put on the first, second or third watch, but you? Will be drawn to by the characters that are so simple yet intriguing, so you can find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childhood because of the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney continues to strongly hold the title of "Best World Animate", and "A Life Bugs" stand as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments was delightfully "out-taken" added to the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of these out-take place as I? I told the VHS tape there is only one alternate version for every tape. The DVD also features "games Gerry?" Which is a delightful little short PIXAR which also showed before the movie in theater. This is not far superior to the movie compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which at all is very beautiful, but lacking in the animation and the development of the story and character. If you look at the stars' voices in both films, "Antz" is largely disbanded with the "movie" movie star and a few familiar "television" stars voice, where "A Life Bugs" is just the opposite, packed with "TV "star and Kevin Spacey as the salt stands out exceptions. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks may be blaming or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your job cut out for you. This is the kind of movie that almost made me want I had kids sharing it with them. Don? T think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though.
