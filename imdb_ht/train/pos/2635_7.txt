Take me: A funny take on King Lion, posing as an end. Amazing fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another funny straight-to-video, this is a theater treaty. I do not see why Disney released this straight into video, and released crazy movies like "Little Chicken" and "Back to Neverland" teatrically. Those movies are best seen in the video stores (in the area of ​​"New releases"), rather than seeing theater posters outside theaters. This is simply a parody of the first movie (although the events of the "Pride Simba" have not taken place yet), on Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and the Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) point of view. We get to see them make fun of the events of the first movie. Original voice from the first movie, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voice roles from the first movie, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as Timon's mother with brown sucks. /> <br /> So do not like this sound. Maybe by now, but go look for it for yourself. The fact that it's not that serious to draw it makes it more enjoyable. It's kind of like MST3000 and Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video Rating Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
