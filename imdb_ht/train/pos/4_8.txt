FUTZ is the only show in the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of off-off Broadway). Even though it's not for everyone, it's a brilliant, glamorous comedy, even more often deeply disturbing story about love, sex, personal freedom, and revenge, a moral moral story even more important now at a time when Congress wants Tail gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about gay, though - it's about sex and sex that does not comply with social norms and therefore must be removed from violence and hatred. On the surface, she tells the story of a man who fell in love with a pig, but like any big fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger - stifling compliance in America. The step-by-step version has won international reputation in its original production, making a tour of the US and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all the subsequent theater. Luckily, we've preserved here to show as much as it was originally conceived, and cast the original and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also led HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). It's not a handicap, easy-to-take, studio movie - this is an aggressive, disturbing, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative storytelling that you have never forgotten. And it just might change the way you see the world.
