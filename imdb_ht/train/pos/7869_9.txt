Madhur Bhandarkar gave it all raw. But the best part is he has not forgotten to give the ingredients. It came short and the visual viewer and the audience is making the choice right now. Page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it. Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and is enjoying his work. A simple and peaceful life worships him with a caring companion and a beautiful roommate Pearl. She has covered the page Celebrity Page in Today's Nation, where she has a very supportive Deepak Suri editor (Boman Irani). Life is turning to her as she hits the ball first and she's heading away go to crime. Omigosh! a whole new world was waiting for him. It is shock, excited, stunned and revelation. His reaction caused the loss of work. At the end it's back to page 3. Now, when it meets any celebrity at a party, she knows the real looks of each, hiding under the illusive figure. The movie has a message and it is gross. The audience needs to find it in their own colors. The theme and the scenario were fantastic. Some very good thoughts apply to preparing their audiences. Like the foreplay club shown in front of the pedofiliac display, the suspension is short before gay-action in toilets. The strong dialogue and the actors are really good to give it. The words of Charu Mohanty are common and very successful in pronouncing these words and intelligence, leaving an impact. Selection options could have been better. The songs do not stand anywhere; but they needed in the background. Atul Kulkarni has a major role. There was a few visible flaws. Athul Kulkarni explains Konkan Sharma that their honesty should be attained with intelligence. Could have been a better dialogue as this sounds like a preacher. The meeting between Thapar and her daughter does not call for action. That scene looks very unprofessional. <br /> <br /> In general it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophile incident. This can spoil your mood.
