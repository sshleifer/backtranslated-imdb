Nora is one mother-of-two who always wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as making friends, a group of writers, musicians and actors. The philosophy of 'free philosophy' is not quite out of the system ?? and Nora did not count on falling in love, especially with a junkie. Hazlehurst won his first two AFI Awards in the space of four years for his amazing painting at Nora, who makes sure he does right by his children, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels ) at the same time. Garner ?? Who would later costume in films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES AND PLANET PLANET ?? is well-placed as Nora's pre-pubesan daughter, and Caton (maybe in preparation for her role as host of the LIVE PROPERTY LIFE program in 2000 ???) appears as a bearded pentry. Early efforts by director Cameron is a winner; He went on to make the award-winning ministers MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's stunning delivery by Hazlehurst that brings in intelligent life, looking for the script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
