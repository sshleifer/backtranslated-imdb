I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's work, giving to the viewers and photos of the absolutely unique and typical "Lynch-elements" movement. When you saw most of her work, I swam thinking that I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dying. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first trauma, I began to contemplate this very primitive character, and I was the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgusts presented here are booming mirrors from reality , was emphasized by not distorting it. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, they are either disgusting or awful, however, they are surrounded us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, even if you will sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of everything we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. It just exists. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find typical Lynch elements as well. I recommend tolerant people !!!
