This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the film go the distance though. Without giving away the draw, I would describe it as a new favorite Princess Bride culture that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side of Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are in romance, adventure and well-organized comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (Parents I did!) Good effects, they may be afraid of the little ones. Good movie date. Great for some escapism. <br /> <br /> Always an A. (Hope it does well in the box office)
