I went to this movie to think it would be a b-rated movie. I was surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. It has amazing comedy distribution. The jokes in this movie were amazingly original and really funny with one or two jokes flat in between. The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and returns to the haunting woman who is going out and she's been having husband, her sound far-fetched but she actually works well. <br /> 7/10 - In general it's a movie cinema look, if not found on DVD when it comes out.
