I watch the back series back in as fast as possible. I try to watch everything Star Trek. This is 3 months and I'm currently in Season 3 of TNG and I've already gone through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> The "Shades of Gray" is the first episode of the TNG series. Having just watch their show, these clips were cool in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them were shot in because the movie looked better. Season 1 always looks real and ugly for me - and the actors look amazing, as they did not fit into their own skin. <br /> <br /> The show is essentially just being made up of a big hit in the happiest and sad moments of Riker's life on the Enterprise up until that point. Data and Riker scenes of the pile of olo-is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Riker's Klingon Rider Challenge Boat as the first officer and Riker beat the living CRAP from that Klingon. Then the admiral kicks her a $$ but good. This entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy, great things have happened already in a season 2 and only 5 more away with a handful of movies! At this point in the series they really begin to develop the emotions that tie Riker Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Until this point were mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Alpha's memory claims that Imzadi means "first" and means that he has intimate relationships with Riker and also remains deeply close to one emotional one. This more proven episode will have an exciting romantic tension of each other for a long time to come. <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, production value is up to speed and star trek TNG is solved in the great Sci- Women were destined to become. Watching this again as an adult I see now what GREAT ACTORS Star Universe is giving. They really need to make a new show ST set after all of the current shows. A DS9 movie would also be good.
