When I'm a true product of hip-hop and the electronic dance music music, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects like Wild Style, is a movie that guarantees tugging the hearts strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban / DJ based music and electro-club culture . You must admit that at times the dialogue is a bit cheesy, you can not help but feel for the characters, and finally "want you were there" for the start of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The battalion battalion scene at the Roxy Nightclub (a real life, real-time competition between Rock Steady Crew's legendary and NYC Breakers) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan's archive as any classic album. Look at some of the breaks of the slow-motion breakers if possible really appreciate the athletic and stylized expertise of a seasoned B-boy / B-girl. All praise due to the Zulu country !!!
