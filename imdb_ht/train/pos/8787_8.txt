This movie increases my opinion at Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his know-how and sprezzatura (cast in a couple of European-high-falutin 'terms), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only a little) as an actor, as he plays an unprecedented social climber and a huge month with a sense of nervousness. Thrust in support is excellent; Everyone looks well chosen for their role. The story moves suddenly, and, while not particularly profound (it lacks, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social comment on the massive uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly amuses and meets. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful in history. I also really enjoyed great reputation in San Francisco's 1880s. All in all, there is little love on this movie ... very well worth the time to look it.
