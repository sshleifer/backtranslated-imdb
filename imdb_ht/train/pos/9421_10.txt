There are * mobs * - also, my quotes can not be exact. <br /> <br /> Everyone still notes the satire of Social and Social Economic Next - how true. But for me, I see this film much more than that. I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing glowing costume. There are many confusing and brutal in the world around him, but he will not stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - its juvenile grin and eternal curiosity are, therefore, suitable: <br /> <br /> "This invincible spirit - you can tell me, what is the petrol ink ratio? " <Br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when it realizes that his invention has not worked after all - standing almost naked. But more than shame is the simple disappointment that "he did not work." It never really intimidates people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to stop it too." It's a moment of hesitation before it was trying to get away again. Does it show any signs of pain like a must've betrayal? No <br /> <br /> Also remarkable is Dapne's role. It is sick and tired of money and power. He thinks he finally found love, outside of his father's company. At first it does not really handle Sidney anymore. But the moment he falls on his car and goes back to see if he may kill him - and yet he still thinks only of the beauty of his invention. He finally found something he thought worth living for. The funny thing is that it does not even romance. It is friendship, but in such an ephemeral nature that the title almost does not fit. It is more admiration, and maybe even inspiration. <br /> <br /> When they discovered that Michael has no real love for her, and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her and give in to cynicism and try time to Sidney. Fortunately it finds that there are really people in this world who live for more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney If you would say 'yes' I think I'd have to block you." I love the very end, when all this crazy business seems to have come to nothing. But then, the bubble, originally beat and Sidney goes off, strides to match the melody: dauntless. Where is Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and it was not really a scientist. He received help from escape and was "a shot in the arm of hope." (Pollyanna) A contingent relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel said "it's more than I expected for ..." <br />
