I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were, nor was I hoping to be cast into such a well-developed artistic and artistic scheme to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'm going to be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially love the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it was not a cheesy vampire movie, nor was it about embellishing that fact. The characters all had human features. His way of showing the growth of the characters was extremely tastier, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them in their lifetime. I give this movie two inches far. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the past five years.
