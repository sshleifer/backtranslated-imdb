I saw this movie in an advanced screening and found it excellent. New York I love you is a true turn of romance that explores smart, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful human race. Throw is great, a genuine ocean 11 and Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Kuhou Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all stand out performances in one way or another. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This does not mention that there is someone in that of director expansive storytellers in smart and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This movie is not a straightforward romance or romantic comedy though it is both romantic and funny. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's good in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
