"The Woman in Black" is unlikely to one of the most crapest British ghost stories ever made. Teen lawyer, after arriving in a small town occupying a real customer's death, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is packed with incredibly unusual atmosphere and frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum possible effect. The view holds the viewer deeply involved and the final is quite disturbing. The operator is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable in times.So if you want Seeing a horror movie really crap to give this one a look. I give everyone to watch the "Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off.Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
