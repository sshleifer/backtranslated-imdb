Neil Simon's Sunshine Boy begins Walter Matthau and George Burns is a comic comedy about the unusual bond of life and beauty, but the laugh still bitter taste. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) of the great actor theater actress now reduced on the ineptness of the hard and old age you can feel angry only with blue. Willy never surrender and continue to look at work, while Al is tired of the players and it is retired from the home country to his daughter. The couple in his old age was really funny and harmonious, but out of the scene was a continuing heat and account, and for eleven years after breaking off by talking. Now, if they work, they must return together once more to make one of their best old drawings for a comedy storytelling show. The encounters are explosive and released for the old questions ??. Neil Simon's scripts provide a certain corrosive spirit in the story with the sadness and the overwhelming bleak gag and laughter in place to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu (nominated Academy Award as Best Actress) and George Burns ( Won Awards Academy as Best Supporting Actor). The two actors are very credible and real and the harmony seems almost as they are real to work together for all this time and that Realty does not carry between them. The film is also very touching for its full-time reality as the story is telling and how the love-heat ratio that ties the actors is totally real part of the weird but at the same time usually the things in life. My rate is 7.
