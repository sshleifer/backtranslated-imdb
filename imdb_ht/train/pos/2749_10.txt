A good picture is worth every word. This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed about people with Down syndrome. But I will not spoil it by telling you. You will want to see it yourself. <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not need to understand a single word he was told to understand his meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has a magic of its own. After watching it, I understand better that we put too much value on it and not enough about our loved ones. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
