Although John Woo is boiling is my number 1 favorite movie. But I must tell police history is my number 2 favorite movie. I say this because the exhibitions, battles and actions my favorite part of the film is when Jackie Chan jumps to the train at the top of the sculptor at the mall on a pole surrounded by Chrismas light and tapered down the fallen pillar through a loftable and finally landing on the back of the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something of 14 dollars.) VHS new video home video. Any questions or comments please feel free to reply. (I only 14 but I know where you can find any movie ever.) If you're looking for a movie and can not find it please answer me. Thanks and Good Night!
