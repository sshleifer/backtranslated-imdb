My husband and I just made him watch this movie. I did not expect it to be this good! I was really surprised at how big the story line was. I'm usually pretty good in figures from twisty cemetery ... but this one has made me. I loved it! I'll have to watch it again before I take it back. I might even have to buy it. :)
