For people with a certain age, W.W. II was the time defined in life, and all that followed could not be compared. As the movie opens, a widow woman is still alive (Judi Dench) heard a gamely street musician trying to play the classic song, "Stardust." This remembers his memory when he played in an almost all-girl band that entertained between bomb attacks during the war. The Drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), happily avoiding the broth and enjoying the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench characters meet and decide to assemble the band, which takes them on a series of mini adventure. Despite UPS and Downs, the group meets and makes a successful comeback. The film is exclusive writing and understated, with superb performance of all involved. Characters are well developed and those who have not quit, despite the years. And there are all wonderful old music swings! <br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but a serious movie anyway. The war affected everyone and that lessons are forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as he teaches.
