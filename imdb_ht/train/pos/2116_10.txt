Has there been ever a movie much better than this? One of the reasons why everything works is that the group of actors really seems to communicate and have an effect on each other's life. The center of it is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along face to face, but which is completely connected to each other anonymously as pale pen. But there are also characters supported and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "You Received Mail", the recent update of "Shop") are not just pouring up in support of their drive and their needs. Everyone has a complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich wallet in charm. One of the most cheerful scenes in film history takes place when Frank Morgan is also pre-tragically relaxed and humbly searches for someone having Christmas dinner with. A must see! **** from ****
