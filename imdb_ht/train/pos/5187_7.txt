This series was just like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is truly one of these frighting, comic, childish shows that you will not forget. Just like Limit Outer (another big show) this series does little. It was great, and worth the long run. It was a great show, that even the kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted them, but they still had a moral in the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize that your situation did not want to end, or those you did. I remember watching some of these on sci-fi when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Surely a fun, imaginative show. I loved it, and always done.
