Love it, but still have nightmares on the hotel manager. Films, presented well, with the choice of actors to bring their roles to reality in the writing. Many scenes have attacked the imagination and created a bright sound. Progression in cunningly written situations, made me believe the story led a way only to get a new twist on what I thought might be the obvious. Too bad has to be commercial. I told many friends to look for more promotions and I of course will see again. I enjoyed the scenery of the movie and felt this add to their plots and intrigue. Husband and wife heated discussions (or should I say fighting)? They were very realistic. The initial situation is one common but the climb in the story presents fortunately is not. I want to thank everyone who participated in this entertainment movie great. Thanks! Looking forward to the next movie --- when? Whidbey
