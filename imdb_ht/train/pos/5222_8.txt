After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then joined the flock. There's just so far a nice smile and a couple of visual film gestures can get you, but it has proved me that he finally got caught up in his craft, he can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as "trainee / replacement". Some have suggested there was too much violence necessary, but I did not see it that way. Nothing I saw detracted from the power of this movie. I was really shocked I had not heard of it being released into the theater and came across it in blockbuster instead. Really an outstanding movie with just the right mix of action, suspense, emotions, and social awareness. As good as 7even? Well, maybe. And you'll see better acting out of Gere than anyone ever gotten out of Pitt.
