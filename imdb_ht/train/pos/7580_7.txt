As much as I enjoyed the Hanzo razor movies, three are definitely enough: 'Who's Got Gold', the ultimate adventure for the Japanese lawmaker and the impressive package, is an enjoyable piece of fun in Pinku movies but offers New ones in terms of ideas will also take a great step forward as far as outrageous. The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost, and looks like it will explore supernatural territory, something that could take the series in an exciting new direction; Unfortunately, after the spook turns out to be nothing but a scooby scoob-style (cooked up by a corrupt official stinging chore to keep people away from the lake where he hid gold stolen), director Yoshio Inoue is content of reclaiming elements familiar from the first two films, the result being an affair rather stiff. <br /> <br /> Again, Hanzo directs an investigation that requires her to interact with the woman using her mighty penis, slicing up his enemies, and his superiors abuse. On the road, we find wild orgy, good-natured rape (Hanzo forces herself on women who wind up to appreciate her will), and sword swords. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen and appreciated the first two films, you might as well look at this installment file set, but have been warned, this is probably the least to satisfy one of them all. <br /> 6.5 out of 10 rounds up to 7 for IMDb.
