Following his Oscar-nominated turn of "Secret & Sir", Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally great "Saving Grace". But let me tell you, this is not the movie sort that you get every day. After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovered that her irresponsible financial decision left her with a massive debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace begins to cultivate it. Each aspect of this movie has played a major role; Do not have a dull moment anywhere in it. And I'm sure you did not see that end scene came up! But anyway, you must see this movie. You just might feel over a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else, it might function as a good lesson on knowing one's finances. But of course, there is a lot more of it than that!
