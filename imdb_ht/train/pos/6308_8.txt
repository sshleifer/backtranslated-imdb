Unusual, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. A group of down-and-outs teams up with a "seasoned" thief raises their heads from their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the vicious factor. <br /> <br /> Nice to see George Clooney doing something really funny for a change. The casting is perfect with the standards to act very high. Although it could be said that the motley crew subject is not new, I think that this movie touches it in a fun and unique way. Suffice so that it means from what has gone before. <br /> <br /> Very well done guy.
