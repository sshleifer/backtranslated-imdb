I saw Insomniac's nightmares not long ago for the first time and I said I really found it to be quite good. If you're a fan of Dominic Monaghan you'll love it. The hole film takes place inside the mind-does it? Acting to everyone else is a little running and unstable and some of the scenes could be cut but it works out to the end. The extracts on the DVD are just as big as the movie, if not bigger for fans of Dom. It has tons of fringe moments from the series, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who went on to make an independent movie will love watching Tess (the director), Dome and everyone else on the very small personal lock screen trying to bang out this little trippy creepy film. It was very enjoyable and I am glad to have it in my collection.
