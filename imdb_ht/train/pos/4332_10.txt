Paul Reiser has performed a spectacular work in writing this film. Peter Falk gives his life performance. It is worthy of awards Academy. This was one of the most provocative and funny movies of the year. Reiser in understanding is fantastic and it is as good as it gets and as it was in long TV time running it "Mad on you". Peter Falk did a self-employed job as his father, and Peter is now 78 years old, and we laugh and cry at the same time. Throwing in support was equal to the gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins gorgeous work. It is a must see movie for 2005. We bet that all people across the ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mom and dad with brothers and sisters like these in the movie. We all had time to be good and bad together and want things different but different.
