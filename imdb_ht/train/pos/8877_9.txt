This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever taken in. John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when joined this educational chief. Brilliant performance is not the whole cast, but Epps and Rapaport turn into the best and most convincing of the young career. <br /> However, as a college myself, many of the issues that Singleton touch on are taken in the extreme. In a sense that, while issues are faced on many college campuses, they are not presented as big or out of the open as this movie would make one believe. In some cases, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something in this nature can actually happen. However, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and let me stutter, speak, just think. One of the items from this picture I'll remember forever, was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character, "Knowledge is powerless, unconscious, you can not see your power." Brilliant, just brilliant.
