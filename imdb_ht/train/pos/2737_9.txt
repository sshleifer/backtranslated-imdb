The film has been adapted from the beginning to finish and b / w photography in the heartland of the US is stunning. We feel we have the right to them as they cross the great sky of the country and then in Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like little river sweat and tears rolling his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs at the time of the final. <br /> <br /> Two criminals, conducted by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could see on any street in any city. Hickock is a boy smiling next door with Smith, the guy and star in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it still surprises us that criminals do not differ in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even older, is part of the human condition. These two delusional kill a whole family, looking for a safe not. Once on the run, they begin to write bad checks, digging out a trail for the authorities. <br /> There are so many active amateur fans. I love John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Also, Geer will shine in a short but excellent scene as the lawyer prosecutors. <br /> I've often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only kept it in short snap; I finally found it after buying the DVD. The result is the finest movie classic movie I've ever seen. <br /> Do not miss this brighter movie. For me, this is what great movie-doing is all about.
