"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but painting, going with her friends on her wager up and down, saying hello to the city, and trying to match and to make everyone known. I guess there was no movie theater, no TV in those days, and the girls had nothing to do, but gossip. I wish he had read a little more. I love Gwyneth, and think it is a beautiful young woman. It is talented, and in "Emma" one has the privilege of listening to Gwyneth songs. I'm looking forward to seeing "Duets", where it is supposed to sing. She is brave to speak English English with all those British Britons, including Emma Thompson's sister, Miss Bates Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dance in Lughnasa). "Madam Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Surely, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American movie royalty, being none other than the daughter of Bruce Paltrow (St. Other Places) and Tony Binner Prize Winner (The Legend of Dangerprints). It will hopefully be around for a real real time. Lucky us! I love Emma and also recommend. It is one of the old stories that are still accurate these days. Favorite Styles: Emma Singing and Playing the Piano. I especially like it by singing a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you do not ask me to contribute an account." Emma: "All your personalities are an account, Mr. Knightley. I thought you overqualified." Miss Bates: "It leaves us sense, very words I tell you, and we have not stopped talking about it since."
