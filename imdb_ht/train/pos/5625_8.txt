Marjorie attracts (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being accused by a lone biker. He is mortally shaken by the attacker of his identity. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the force attacker makes his way to Marjorie's house and his subject is terrible outraged. Pulling with blood, Marjorie managed to get an upper hand on his attacker, knocking the daylights out of the jerk and rendering him helplessness thanks to the specific spray in his eyes and throat. Hog tied and beat himself, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's necklace (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they came home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but not from Marjorie. Should he continue to pay his punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and rough language make for a rating R. Fawcett really gets away from the wits of the wits that would forever look for his career. Kudos gives director Robert M. Young.
