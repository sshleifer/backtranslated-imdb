10/10 for this movie. <br /> I am a British physician of India, now in India. The word Beckham puts me off, 'My cos is a hard-to-die Liverpool fan, and personally think that Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I have been dead to ensure that I would not watch the movie. <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "what heck, let's in time to bide by watching this movie "Cos was a late night show. <br /> What a moron I was. I should have seen this movie the day it was released. I guess using Beckham's name was drawn audience attraction (which was back-fired in my case !!!), but then I really can not think of a better title for the movie. , Knightley (Gorgeous Gout Dead), and Rhys-Myers did a superb job. If you hate football, grip Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is DEFINITly the movie for you. In fact, I'm just 29 years old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid in heart. This movie hit the "Star Wars" in my position.1.1.1. Surprisingly, there is not much comment on this movie by American-Brits like me. I wonder why? <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
