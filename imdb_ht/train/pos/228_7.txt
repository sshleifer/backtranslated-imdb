"Convincing" is a lot of a third movie act. All dialogue and character interaction made in it comes from long wind-down to a late late day. And, by extension, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). This is the first collaboration of Peter Masterson and Horton Foote writer. Six years earlier, the work along the "Bountiful Voyage", a movie that seems almost action-packed in comparison with this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, it's just barely this side of adequate. The slow rate leaves a lot of room for Cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita, who implements the film and just the right sense of light brittle & heat. Because this is essentially a playable movie, and little in the way of Editing or Managing Great Abilities, it all comes to act. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaw here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters all over, without interest in anything besides living. Lukas Haas, a young actor who was familiar with "Testaments" and "Witnesses", played a lot of characters as well as other early roles. It is quiet, remove, a little frightening and sad, somehow. These are kind of natural looks of him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "convincing" is a bad movie. That title, along with the opening stage, seems to create an image of a far more nervous type of photograph. If gently rhythm production does not interest you terribly, you'll want to spend on this one too. Otherwise, this might be exactly the movie you want to have done more often. <br /> Enjoy.
