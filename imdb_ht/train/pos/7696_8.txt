When "Bon Times" was introduced in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcom. It focuses on the poor in Chicago-based Evans family and their struggle to end. Most of the early episodes focus on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide the family. Jan Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were terrific actors and had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J. J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was junk-chase, but well-meaning son who made up for his lack of talented and artistic talent. Thelma was a beautiful, bright girl who was constantly trading insults with J.J. Michael was a well-known prodigy who was well educated about social issues and was destined to be an attorney. In 1976, producers made a big mistake in shooting John Amos, literally killing his character. This really changed the focus, and not for the good I could add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior was angry black viewers as well as star series Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show focused on key African-American issues that existed in society at the time, viewers showed that was too busy with chasing chasing and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> Once Esther Rolle leaves, the quality of show suffers even more. Although he still looked, he was no longer showing the great ground-breaking that he once had. Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became evident that the show was on its last lap. All the loose endings were tied during this season and the show slowly faded in the air. <br /> <br /> The first three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.
