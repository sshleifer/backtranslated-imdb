A pencil draw and dubious characterization makes no difference when a movie is like fun to look like this one is. Live performances and spectacular exhibitions - for the days - give this movie some real code. And some current comedies from chemistry are outright between the two behaviors. Quinn also makes a good mischief, although its role is completely covered. But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's role in great age, this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie in that era. You might be able to forgive that because of the time in which he did, but it's still hard to get past. For all the courage and especially adult-screen situations, this is still less than a good adolescent time.
