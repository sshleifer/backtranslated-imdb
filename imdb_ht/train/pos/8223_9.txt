When I first saw this film, in London, in 1958, I was launching on. I've never seen a movie like this before. It has a strange, hypnotic effect, quite unlike the films I've seen before and has left a lasting impact. <br /> I believe Odile Versios & Marina Vlady sisters, if not twin. Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer. If this was converted into DVD - in Format 2 Region - and in the original French language, I would like to hear about it & where it can be purchased.
