This film takes you to another time when there was a different speed in everyday life. We find an idea how families were faced with the war and how quickly we sent young men to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder of the crash of war not only reaches the front. <br /> <br /> Many chances of we have never had to go to what our grandparents, grandparents or parents are going through during a war. This movie, I think, is a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly as a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely good and as Australian as he can. It is definitely worth it to recite "High Flight" and to make me wonder what it might accomplish with Shakespeare.
