Wonderful James Stewart, Vera Miles car. What makes this historic film deal with the FBI is so good is the family member involved during a 35 year career as shown by Stewart in the movie. The movie shows a story of the great investigation agency. It deals with plane jet plane, killing off of the Oklahoma Indians for real estate, fighting organized crime, Nazi and Communist in this order. The human element is not far behind as Stewart married Vera Miles. They raise 3 kids as Miles' Miles goes out each time Stewart gets out of placement. <br /> Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 "The Graduate." The film has nothing but glory to J. Edgar Hoover. It certainly has brought the FBI up to par. <br /> True, this can be viewed as right-wing propaganda, especially with the real life of Republican Stewart's, but it's well done, historically informative, and the look of the family well shown.
