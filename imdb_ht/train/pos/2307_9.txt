I must say this movie is really amazing and heartwarming. Reese Witherspoon is so good and Jason London is not so bad either! It is so sweet watching Dani falling in love and breaking my heart and again warming my heart at the same time watching Court falls in love with Maureen. however it even slows down how much he cares about Dani. I must admit if I had kind of wanting to fall for Dani at the end. it is just so nice to look for her fall for her I did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen was born in this movie. Watching her dead made me cry for a whole day. I just could not believe it. however never has a more loving relationship was shown in a movie then Maureen and Dani. they really can do it at anything. I gave this movie a 9 because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
