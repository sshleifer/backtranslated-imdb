Well, I saw "They laughed" when he came from Europe around 1982 and kept a surprise but my dear friend. I just saw her again on tapes, almost twenty years after ... Bogdanovich has a genuine tenderness about her character and a kind of sympathy that is difficult not to feel too. Excellent comedy and actor, good lines all over and over and with good correction, too. I laughed and smiled all the time. As we all do, at times. Go to him.
