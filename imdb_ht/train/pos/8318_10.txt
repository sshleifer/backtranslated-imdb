An excellent movie. Superb acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role in Saturn. This movie is one of the latest "black majority" in the 70's and unlike the "blaxploitation" movies in this era, this movie actually had a plot, and it was very well done. The film band, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R & B charts at the time.
