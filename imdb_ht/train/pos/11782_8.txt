Not sure if this has any mob or not, but I do not want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462. <br /> I do not agree entirely with the viewer comments that have been described * Guns, Microbes and Steel * as "politically incorrect" and "neo-marxist." They can not watch the same series * I * did. * * Series * * I watched displaying European colonization history in America and South Africa with no particular authority. I do not see anything in the series describing Europeans as bad people who got lucky, though Europeans often * were * lucky - and nothing wrong with luck. Neither I have seen native peoples described as poor innocent things. If anything, the Enka was rather arrogant - as you expect any leader would be when dealing with strangers, if his land was not conquered by living memory by any other world power. I certainly do not see anything that could be interpreted as Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except by extremely elasticity of imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African people * do * have a malaria immune system and other tropical diseases that European lack. At the moment they were at the height of their success, Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations * were * as advanced as any other in the world - and as rich; sometimes more. The Aboriginal Americans and Khoi-San populations * were * the variation of varying and other diseases introduced by the Europeans; as European settlers were deteriorated by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: Khoi-San people are different from all sub-Saharan African peoples.) So I do not see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I * may find complaining about is that the series did not tell me anything I did not know by time I finished the seventh grade. There's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this movie. It does, however, presents some nice dramatization of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; Production values ​​are very high; and it's full of a few holes here and there who did not get covered in the sixth hour Society of Sourth Science at the Middle School of Milan. If you rent or buy this, considering having a decent primary school and / or high school, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and fun time review already learned (or should have learned) when you hit high school.
