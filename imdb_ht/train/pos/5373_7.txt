Perhaps by the greatest absolute enters the Hammer House of Terror series, but it surely has the award for most inventively titled episodes! "The House Wounding Into Death"? I could call out this title all day without ever tired of it! And besides the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a merely simply writing with a handful of really thrilling moments. It might require an extra look before you completely understand the specifics of the end-twist, but it's definitely an original idea for a short hike. The story is open and images of a couple elderly couple were in their middle home. The husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later "curse" the house is still for sale. A young couple and cherub's daughters are moving in and start restoring it, but mysterious events happen and affect Sophie's baby. His beloved cat is killing a same birthday party he gets lost when one of the house's home suddenly sprays blood on all the guests (a particularly cool one, this one!). Is the old house really haunting? Or maybe the targeted neighbors useful to cause all the horror? The answers to these questions are given to the greatest and original unpredictable justice and have the same room for a real trauma at the very end. The tension is mastery built and the home is titular full of strange scenery, as the pair of sleeves used by the husband to kill his wife. Small warnings though, the sequence and the cat is hard to look when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner for Hammer's short-run series series!
