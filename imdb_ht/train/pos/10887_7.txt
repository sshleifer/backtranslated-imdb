It's a horror movie shot and things are not going well. It's a masked killer. The director said the assassin before the cast and the crew. He goes crazy and kill two people. She killed herself and the movie never ends. Twelve years later a bunch of student films decided to try and finish it - but there's a curse. Those who try and end it kill themselves. Students ignore that. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old hat but this is not bad ... for what it is (a movie low-budget flask). It is well done with a fairly young and talented teenage cast. No one is great, but no one is awful either. It also avoids the billed (and needless) girl scene. It moves quickly, the gore is beautiful and blood and the script does not insult your intelligence. Also Molly Ringwald is in this time of his life playing a bitchy faded actress. <br /> <br /> No big shakes, but not bad at all. I give it a 7.
