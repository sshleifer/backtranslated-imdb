EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the visualizer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film almost a century ago. This film is truly unique, with a work of genius. The Camerawork and the correction are brilliant, and combined with the narrative troupe of alienation used in the film, creates a surprisingly unforgettable and unforgettable experience. The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two culprits that should be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow gives his great voice as the narrator. <br /> A one of a kind movie! Four stars (higher rating).
