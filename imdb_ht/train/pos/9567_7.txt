I watched DVDs in this movie which also came with an Excellent track track (in English). It looks like in Cambodia (the subtitles in English say the character speaks Thai but the movie says Cambodia) a very violent man violently raises boys to be killer using hunger and training them in battle and killing. He sent Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings he was a killed cop killing partner. The cop is a loose cannon that worries about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma. Chief of Wai is his father's friend and worried about Wai's irregular behavior. He does not know that Wai was one who kept his father in dealing with drug dealers and shooting him and putting him in the coma. Pang popping up and hiding in a cool tidal calm where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keep repeating her father will not let her leave (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand this but saved her, from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III). Wai gets more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost irresistible. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where he gets married and gets Wai pregnant to follow and meet the evil man (in training the boys) to make a deal to fight with trains so he can get Pang . There is a great confrontation between Wai and Pang and the woman terribly abused the biggest victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cuts her child from the dead mother only to die and let her as possible next boy to be raised an assassin. This is a very good movie movie with an excellent band. There are many pretty brutal scenes. The woman had a long nail pulled from her feet. Short of the neck and torso. Gun was shot directly at the top. And several very intense beats. It may be intense and downbeat manure but it is definitely worth seeing.
