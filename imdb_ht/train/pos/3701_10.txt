The dinner party could well possibly be in my opinion the greatest cinema production of all time. It is produced in an exquisite way with the actors showing their excellent roles. The kitchen scene begins Yvonne and Juli Ashton is magnificent. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the doctor's office scene is well done. The campfire scene is full of enjoyable actions, though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera performance at the junkyard scene is incredible, but that would expect nothing less from it. The closed scene is somewhat over the use of adult films, but is the classic no less. I would highly recommend this movie to all fans of adult films and casual viewers. Run out of your video store and select it today.
