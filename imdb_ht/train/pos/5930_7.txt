Monsters mother-child-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks life-force in virgin, and the newest targets are beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to scratching the cat ... I have never been fond of sleazy, bestsellerists overaster like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is actually not too as bad as it could be. Yes, it is sometimes jaw-droppingly atrocious, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned cemeteries, unusual band and candlelit-gothic-house-scene, mirror showing the mammoth shape of the bandits, etc. Of course , this film is polluted by Mr Dung's poison lip and all-tactile-of-toilet-obsession mania deliberately grease people, which leads to fully reproduced teacher rapper subplot, but has roses among manure.
