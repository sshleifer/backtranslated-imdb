When our local TV station first launched, it was filling a lot of its schedule with British old programs. "Close Your Daughter!" was hardly revealed, and I - swayed by opening a few seconds in the movie - popped in an empty tape. Best thing I ever do. <br /> <br /> <br /> The actors are very well suited to the characters and bring them in delightful life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you in point, as they will Hoyden and his family). Monitor the duplicates, draw lines of wheels in mixed wheels and match the characters, huge gigantic persists in each scene, and risky comments are made on a regular basis. <br /> I've shown the movie movie a few years ago and called the piece "a lost treasure," as much for the cast as for the story. At that day I can crack up just thinking about the dialogue. Should this gem ever find its way into a DVD release, I'm going to the front of the line.
