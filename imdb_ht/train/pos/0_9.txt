Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. He runs at the same time as some other school life programs, such as "Professor". My 35 years in the teaching profession led me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is "Professor". Fighting for survival financially, the persistent students who can see right through the pathetic teachers' devices, pettiness in the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew with the students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately reminded ......... in .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here one of your teachers. STUDENTS: Welcome to Bromwell High. I hope that many adults in my age think Bromwell High is far off. What a pity that it is not!
