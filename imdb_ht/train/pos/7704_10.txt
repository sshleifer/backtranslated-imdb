Certain elements of this movie are dating, of course. A whole white man crew, for example. Like the nearest Star Wars Science Fiction, it tends to take too long admiring itself. But, however, no movie has ever taken the Golden Age Science Fiction as this one has done, even down to use the "electronic tonal" to score music. The Robbie Robot excited Asimov's robots, and was inspirational for all that followed, from C3PO Data. The plot line, of course, is the Shakespeare's "Storm". Morbius is Prospero, and exile wizard who finds his government invaded by interloping ... It was a movie that treats Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
