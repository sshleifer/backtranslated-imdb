A female friend is currently being drawn into a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. Of course the SOB is very good-looking, good, etc. and my friends are a very intelligent woman. Watching Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what's going on in real life when men like these are destroying the lives of our female friends. It's tragic, and you know it will end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty. A blanker at all, he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will find the reaction he wants. The scene two hours when Leaud and Lebrun made love, and in the morning he put on a record and, very sweet and charmingly, singing together to entertain it is brilliant. "What the hell I'm doing here with the expression" expression that flickers return and ideas across his face will be in my memory for a long time to come. It's a long movie, but seeing it's one go, preferably in a movie theater. Take a moment to enter, but then the time just disappears.
