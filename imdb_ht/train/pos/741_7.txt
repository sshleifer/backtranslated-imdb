I was just a bit young for this one, but I saw it. There are some excellent music, many people mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by "angel", a currently mostly ignored, but once quite popular music outfit. Wearing the trademark white trademarks, they are chewing in "20th Century Fox", and apparently all try to bark in the camera's vision of vision. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains emphasizing the bands, and has apparently never gotten into a couple, ever! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) starts a short, but remarkable, acting career here, and is quite memorable with Jodie Foster, and the rest. (Topless 3-D scene of "parasite", and UFO he sees, in "Wonder" keeps us all watching him for a while). <br /> <br /> It's not a boss, but it preserves a bit of its period, so everyone is happy and amazed.
