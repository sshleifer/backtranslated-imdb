This movie is bufunery! and I loved it! "The Dragon Master" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "Cowboy", totally made fun of film, essence, and just plain silly. The film is a rare blend of a fight against evil vs. (somehow) the wonderful and fun growing. Long Shao You take the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon master" (so-called child of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which involves apply smart, devise ways to escape studying (with the help of all the house, including the tutorye), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) way to find the affection of a local girl, competing in "football" (you will see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the middle of a fight to save a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. The movie has its serious moments. But they do not squeeze, but rather inspire. The playfulness of the boys is not lost in this exchange, but is actually working against evil. What I really like about this movie is how it ends. By the typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you will see. Let me just say that it truly captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> funny, witty, senseless, and nostalgic. big movie.
