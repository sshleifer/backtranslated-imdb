Another of them does not em up like this category. This story of a family whose skeletons in his closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are in their troubled troubled Hadley, and they really take the roles and run with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack were nominated in the category supported, both honors were eminently well-deserved. Counterbalance leads to a bit bitterness. Both Bacall and Hudson could never call bad actors, but they both had the best part and played far more compelling than they did here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing like a red-blooded heterosexual as it does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But this does not take away the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable with this movie very much. If you up some night and this movie comes over I would say it look. It is well worth it.
