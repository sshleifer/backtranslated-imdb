I've seen a great movie, but 'Cold Blood' stands alone in a class alone. It is excellent in each department. The fact that it has some great stars helps push it on the head as you pay close attention to the characters and stories, rather than the name on the chapel. Blake and Wilson turn into stellar performance in the bloodthirsty duo. The fact that many of the films are filmed in the current place where the crime took place, even indoors, adds more thrill. The black / white photograph of the mood and the photography is magnificent. There are many outstanding cinemas working out, but if I could only vote for one of the top list, it would probably be "in Cold Blood".
