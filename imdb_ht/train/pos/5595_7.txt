Polanski returns to the terms of loneliness and madness that he explores this tremendous effect of repulsion and rosemary's baby from the tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - black, brooding, unnerving - but there is something about this movie and I'm not sure whether it is deliberate. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not quite make him right here. As his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a little disappointed in how some cases of truly impressive movies in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really allows the movie to descend is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but it seems to have been biting off more than he can grind with the difficult task of Trelkovsky. Some of the support cast are great, notably Melvyn Douglas as the owner and Shelley Winters as the concierge, but others are weak and wrong. It is also difficult to get past the fact that all these things are supposed to Parisians have American accent. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, there are some fine moments in black comedy in the movie. Anyone who has seen the Vampire disappointing shooters knows that Polanski is certainly a good actor actress. However, there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is likely to increase giggles than eyebrows, which detracts from what would be a powerful moment in its psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> All in all, the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too sick for its own good. There's a handful of exceptionally cool moments with a still comfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this movie, while being very good, does not quite hit the mark as successful as it might have. <br /> <br /> Well, at the end of the day, an 'okay' film Polanski is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth a look, just do not expect to be blown away.
