First I clog this movie on VHS than I just bought it on DVD, it is about to my favorite movies ever. I read the book, but I really think the movie is better. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley was an excellent pick. It was brilliant! <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
