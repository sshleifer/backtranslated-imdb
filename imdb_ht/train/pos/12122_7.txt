The movie can be great. I just watch her last night, but feeling unable to give an honest opinion to her because I read the first book. The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the movie. If you plan to look "in human bondage," do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good, and it's a lot more than Phillip's love affair with Mildred, you can still enjoy it after seeing the movie. I do not claim this lightly. I average reading a book every 4 days, and it's like disparate authors as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato, and Shakespeare. "Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the top ten women ever wrote.
