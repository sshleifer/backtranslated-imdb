The "Lady Ladies" suffered a common problem in the middle of the movie "Saturday Night". And that is, a pattern that usually achieves in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laughter, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a gay-maniac straight from the '70s, and Ferrell will be as a lit-obsessed husband cuckolded by Leon. So this movie is funny enough, but it's no "Wayne World"!
