Seeing Keifer Sutherland playing my favorite character in the television story, it was a foregone conclusion I was going to go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans. The movie revolves around a shed that a Secret Service Agent is planning to assassinate the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems only the likely candidate is the highly decorated burst (Michael Douglas). Fun innocence, Pete goes to the fun, style save, to search for the truth. <br /> It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent throw, a decent story but let me feel a bit empty, but you might certainly make it far worse.
