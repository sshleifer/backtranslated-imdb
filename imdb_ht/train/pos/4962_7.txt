"The Brake Show" is a good thing .Probably not at the same level than "Hunger Teen Aqua" or "Cosmic Ghost Coast in Coast", but definitely has lots of brilliant moments .Basically it follows the life of Zorak and Brak normal life and go to school, living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50's sitcoms. The humor and animation of this show it's so much as "Hungry Teen Aqua" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters .But it is good, it has funny parts. Some of the songs are great, others are not many, but I love this show. The funniest character is Brick father. (who is someone, nobody knows why)
