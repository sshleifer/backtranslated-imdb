The "Godfather" on TV, but aside from his army and mobster characters, the two are nothing. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually a part of two families - in one family he is a loving father not yet-perfect-husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually derive from his mother Livia, who's suspected of hovering-personality disorder. Gandolfini is fairly praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as recognizable for their performance as well as talent as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant support roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street band) plays its first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite compelling and obtaining. Chianese, the only recurring actor was actually appearing in a godfather movie, playing Tony's uncle and over-and-off enemy. Many fans also liked characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay", but not remarkable (with the exception of Iler's wireless performance in the third-to-last episode, "The Second Coming"); Siri and Schirripa are compelling and over-the-top, but the show is too strong to keep it back. Just as the show continues for six seasons, it stops having a dull or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (from four)
