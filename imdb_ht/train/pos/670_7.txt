LATEST WAVE will never win the mainstream audience. It's a slow-moving, but fascinating movie for those who want to go along with it. An Australian property lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused of the murder of one of their own. All kinds of portable and fast-paced pop ups, such as the death of the man involving a tribal problem that were not meant for the white man's court, and very soon the lawyer has distinguished facts from fantasy. It seems like the end of the world can be in hand, and he and the aborigines can know this but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is in his peak here. David Guptil, a familiar figure from several other Austrian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. LATEST WAVE is simply not for everyone, yet it is MAGNOLIA (both happen there are strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on a night slowing down Saturday.
