I was so happy I came across this short film. I'm still so shame that the short films are hard to reach all, so when I saw this, he saw that he was nominated for Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so happy that I actually had a movie that I got for. The plot is very simple, the director, writer, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come up with a reason why people would suddenly break out of a song and dance numbers as they did in movie music. The result is very fun and the song is actually really catchy. It's a short film, well edited and the actors are all doing a great job. And the last shot in the movie is perfect. <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
