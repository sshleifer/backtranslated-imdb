My brother and sister and sting on the champions when our local station was re-run in it a summer in the 1970s. We absolutely adore it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual American re-run (Junction Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It has a similar feel with the Avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also British and in the genre / adventure genre). <br /> I would like to see it again now - hopefully it holds. I mentioned this show to others and no one ever heard of it, so I started wondering if I would imagine its entire existence. But the wonder that the Internet has allowed me to draw down information about it. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
