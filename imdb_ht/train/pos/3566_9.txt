In 1954 Marlon Brando was the hot actor after her performance at Streetcar wanted Desire and on the Waterfront. Frank Sinatra has again re-invented himself on the silver screen. Hand painted the sinatra as Nathan Detroit's long time, helped re-establish Sinatra and his fans. It's a great screen version of a great game with the choice of driving and support players are terrific. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his only sole, it only sings as he described Sky Masterson. In addition to the female drives, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (replaying her role as Nathan's long-suffering girlfriend), put in a superlative effort. Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely), with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no version one of the Rockin 'boat even comes near the Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who would go to fame as TV producers of these shows as the Danny Thomas Show and the Dick Van Dyke Show make the "Harry horse" wonderful, BSPulley is excellent as the harsh to speak rough and rough "Big Julie" and even Regis Toomey offer his excellence as "Arvide Brothers". It is one of the fun musicians to see, good comedy, and you get to Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "lucky to be a Lady tonight" and brother ... "it's your bone"
