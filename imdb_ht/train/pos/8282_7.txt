** MUSIC SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the film that does not work is the Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie usually is not far behind it. Interpretation of filmmakers in Wendigo's form is interesting, and may be quite ominous when filters correctly - when the killer sees the Wendigo in a flash of his looking glass, for example - and the shape of the tree was actually very good. However, as a monster character he never really comes to life. We do not get much of an explanation for his behavior, and what we see in it does not come with either the story said in the movie itself, or any Wendigo prayer I've ever read. /> I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it does not give enough to make, in the movie. When you boil this movie down to its bones, you have a suspense suspense and a little bit of a supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; The filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well. Otis characters come across as truly dangerous and unpredictable, making it the real monster of the movie. It would be more effective to describe his behavior as he had Wendigo's hungry mind, which would be a more accurate representation of real-world legends. I heard reports without confusion (from a group of news) that the reason Wendigo did not do much that, when the monster was built, he was wound up so slowly and comfortably (in order to imitate the position he stood on the clay peel, the scene was walking on his toes) that he was almost impossible to run, walk, or otherwise do in it. So the many flash of the beast still stand, and obviously the sped-up foot in it runs. I stress that these reports are not confirmed.
