What I Expected: An overly-overly-stereotyped illusion of a sports-crazy guy and an equally painted artistic painting of the galley who loves him again while suffering his second zippered banana for his favorite sport team . <br /> What I got: A same story - but where both guys and gals end up admitting - at the top of each other - that each have their passion in life again each can forgive the other to save love to share .. <br /> <br /> Sound bad, but with unmistakable humor and terrific performance this work works! Barrymore is the classic Barrymore: the perfect mixture of sweet, strong, and adorable. We hope to come out of it and deliver it. <br /> But Fallon is the beautiful surprise of this movie. It brings in the role of the perfect mix of black sports combined with the appreciation of normal things in life, such as taking care of the kids and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers its lines and subtle perfection. He can take care ("You just run across the field for me!") And the same breath must be blindly blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How does the grass feel? Kinda spongy?") At the same time. Portrait of the Fallon "made" the movie. Hopefully, this film marks the start of a best movie career for Fallon, something that surpasses the humorous humor moods typical of Alarm SNL (ie Will Ferrell). In short, a movie that could have fallen victim to male stereotypes against women was raised above this limit and provided nonstop spot-on-line comics, most released and brilliantly subtlety by Fallon. <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she liked it as much as I did. It is neither a "Flick Guy" nor a "Chick Flick". It's a terrific make-your-laugh flick. Go see it!
