Why was it sound like the husband kept calling his appy? He lost a great spice and so I can only give it a 6. Good grammar and pronunciation are essential to a movie. <br /> It was pretty Hellraiser that with all of the skin chip even though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin skin is an important orginal organ in the body actually actually and without dying. The more in a horror movie is the truth more creepy it can be and more fun. <br /> I admit if the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 comes on Yankies to find your English par!
