Ya. That's what I think. Make sure she's always been a great show with John in it but I personally think it's the best way without. <br /> I love having CJ and Dad living in the house because they are funny together. > <br /> When John was still around I really did not laugh much as I do now. <br /> It's too bad that no more they did. (I do not think ...) because I would like to see some new materials. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always left out. It's still about Bridget or Carrie. What about Rory !!! Honestly this is a great show and everyone who never looked it should go and watch it. I almost guarantee you're laughing. well even chuckle.
