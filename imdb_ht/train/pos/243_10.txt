Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, great acting, all techniques (especially sinematography) are sharp and the script is smart. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is terrific as Edward 'Ned' Kelly. He is enraged as the legendary bandits, and is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All sections of the action on the point <br /> <br /> The movie is the cornerstone of your seat up to the end. One of my favorite films from the legendary late Heath Ledger, who was the highlight of each film he starred in and made no mistake here. <br /> An excellent film all round.
