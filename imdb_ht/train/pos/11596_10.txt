I saw this film when I was about 7 years old - was 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the cute eagle. And I just could not believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die ... My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her lately he remembered the movie we saw with the boy and eagle and said he remembered it as we saw it only yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> This movie is a must see !!! <br /> You never forget it - just like my sister and me ...
