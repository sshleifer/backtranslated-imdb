My mom took me to watch this movie when she came out Christmas in 1976. I liked it then and I love her now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this one, but I think it looks like great sound! ... And I seem to remember a number of cheating women who allow look at the moment! Also, the bass bath scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just for sexy! The music is great as well. This is Babs Groove 70's at its best!
