I've just seen this recently, after an interval of almost forty years. It holds up well, especially Lionel Bart's excellent song. ("Who will buy" with his magic counterpart, just one of many standouts.) <br /> I do not agree with the other post that decrees its G Rating. The evaluation system, brand new at the moment, never intended the G (General) rating means "completely devoid of conflict". <br /> <br /> Characterize it as unsuitable for children to remind me of the description I once saw in the Wizard of Oz: A girl came to a foreign country and killed the first person she encountered. Then he went on a road trip with three male companions and killed again.
