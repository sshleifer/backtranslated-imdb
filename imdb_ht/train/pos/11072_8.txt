it's all very simple. Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con with the lady ladies. to find compassion on his story of loss and failure, and his misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control over the rules of small crooks. They decided to give Jake the ultimate freedom: from his intimate fear, from what he believed to be himself. For that, they took him on a journey where he had left all the fear, all the pride, all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will. <br /> it's a smart movie about the journey of illumination, about the infinite players and games that we do with and in ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
