This is a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's a very short film, and I definitely recommend watching it more than once, you'll be 'getting it' more a second. <br /> It's like spinach but the rap version. It has a lot of mood in it that can be a negative thing in influencing film, but it's just a p ** total take and is not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> Many of the stand-out bits, one of these types of films that you will find yourself quoting lines with your companions, and will laugh. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite party is the 'middleware' middle section. Great video, superb!
