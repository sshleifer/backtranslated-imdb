Even though she has one of the "Price Revenge Price Standards," this movie is my favorite at Vincent Price. Gallico has that missing quality of many character-loving films. When you look at it, you feel it, you feel frustration, injustice against it, and you applaud it when it comes to revenge, even if it's scary for you a little bit with its original fury. As the movie goes on, its characters become tragic. He was committed to murder, but now he must kill them covering up. And yet they cover that one up. And again ... your stomach sinks with her soul as she goes downward spiral-like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. Even though the revenge story is in the old, the top-toe tracer is original- Gallico uses its tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. This one shame is not available for home vehicles.
