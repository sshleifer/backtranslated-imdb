American icon Henry Fonda shows "Elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who had his beloved grandpa "Eleanor" resting after a long hospital delay forced him to miss his paycheck. Deciding that he would like to make one more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals back Eleanor, and hooks up with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to link his troops to prostitutes . /> <br /> wonderful performance Fondas' is a natural cast cast for a movie that tugles into the heartstrings as effectively as it's chic comic to the most funny scenes. A superb cast including Robert Englund, as a bullshit, Susan Sarandon (who also becomes co-producer of credit), and Dub Taylor (a delightful camel, as always, in the most flattering comedy of photos a) help endlessly. br> <br /> Of course life-affirms the nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey brings incredible weight; This is a picture, which gives you to get into it, you can remember long after it's over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is clearly displayed here; The country just looks nice. Set up beautiful Craig Safans music scores, it's a remarkable photograph in terms of aesthetics. He lost a little something of his final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intruder), but it still holds good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central character. <br /> <br /> Not in all the exploitation / drive-in bell pictures one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, the "Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a rewarding movie experience that I can be recommended without crime. <br /> 9/10
