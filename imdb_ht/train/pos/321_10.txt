I do not know how or why this movie has a lean rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "My Curious: Blue" is a mastery. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down to this movie is if you do not like the process of filming, do not like psychology or if you've waited hardcore pornographic ramming. This is not a movie that you will want to look at relaxation; It is a movie that you want to see as any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** THEM IS MY A SPOILER OR FROM ******* <br /> The main thing about this movie is that it mixes the movie all in one movie, but it does in a way that sometimes you forget that fiction is not real. The movie is like many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary, on the social system in Sweden at the time. Which in many ways are still relevant today. Interview made by a young woman named Lena. <br /> 2. A narrative on a cinematographer, Vilot Sjoman, to make a movie ... he deals with a relationship with his star in the movie and how he should never have been involved with those he was supposed to work with . 3. Vilgot's film is done. It is about a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), who is young and very politically active, she is doing a documentary (IE # 1.). It is also a come in age and in its sexuality, and this freedom. <br /> <br /> The Pleasantite and Absolutely brilliant "I'm Curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are cut together. At a time you are looking at an interview on politics, and next to you will look at what the interview is doing behind the scenes, but doing so well that you sometimes forget it is the narrative. Another is the dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", which if you see one, you must see the other. "Blue" is not an end at all. I will try to explain it better I can because of my knowledge, no other movie has made it even though it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "yellow" as a living thing, current events of 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> Think of "Blue" as all of these are the 14 sets of "yellow" that you did not see, that's a complete story about her own. <br /> The essence of parallel film ... the same story, said in two different ways. <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I completely understood "Yellow" <br /> I hope this was useful for those who were discouraged by various influences, because This movie changed my way of filming. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
