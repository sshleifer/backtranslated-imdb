If I just saw the pilot in this show I'd rated it a 10. I was immediately tuned to this gorgeous new world. The subsequent episodes did not completely live up to the promise, but I'll keep watching with the hope that it keeps getting better. The production values ​​are incredible and the act is first-rate. I do not mind that it does not seem to align perfectly with BSG because I'm so intrigued by the quotes and let's face it, they are two different shows. I am pleased that both Esai Morales and one of my allies, Eric Stoltz, returned to my life (if only weekly) as I missed them both. This is a show that requires a bit of thought out of its audience and that is always a good thing. You kind of wrap yourself around some aspects of the show; Things are not always as they look and certainly have shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in line draws, characters and, of course, the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the trip is looking to be quite a ride.
