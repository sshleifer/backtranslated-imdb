This is a fun movie. actually might make you uncomfortable because it is not some unbounded psychopath or sociopath, its daily doctors. how scary is that. there were some good actors and actresses in this movie, though some unappresented like Virginya Keehne as Sarah. Ken Foree which you could recognize from Zombie Rob Zombie's demolition and Halloween (2007) co-star as our detective on Schizoid Trail. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). The short summary is this: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a guy with a sexy wife, handsome home, and is a great dentist for everyone. Until he catches his wife coping with him and the pool cleaner. Then he begins to have delusions that his patient teeth are all rotten and that the female patients are his wife as he starts to go black in this thriller. But before that, nice guy.
