"The Panic in the Streets" is a fairly impartial movie of director Elia Kazan and has done before his classic masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Wanted Desire", "On The Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan had already won an Oscar in 1947, before this film, so it was not an unknown complex at the time. Still "panic on the streets" is mostly a movie that has passed under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the script script. It has a very good and excellent concept of throwing its blood pressure and a feeling of crime / film-noir element. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. The cast is fairly unknown (especially at the time it was released) but it still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palans in one of the first movie films. Especially Palans seduced as the bold gang boss, with a very powerful looking figure. Always the movie shooter a little at some point. The movie begins in beautifully but after the start of the film slowly and does not always make the right decisions in terms of pace and point of view the story is told. <br /> But "Panic in the Streets" remains a film perfectly watched, mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes the movie one credible to look. For fans of the genre of thriller this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
