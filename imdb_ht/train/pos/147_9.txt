The stories in this video are very fun, and it's definitely worth a look! The first one worries a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks, with a big, but unreasonable twist at the end. <br /> <br /> Seagull is the best of the many, and she alone makes this worth watching - A man attacked by a dog in what appears to a hospital, but found out staff are not exactly what they appear to be ...... Great twist in the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10! If others were up to this one, this would get 10/10! The third is the weakest in the bunch - A girl meets with some guys and having wild sex! There seems to be no point in the story until the end, with a little twist, but it is spoiled in the terrible first part! <br /> Never less, this is a great movie that will not hurt you at all! Well worth a rental!
