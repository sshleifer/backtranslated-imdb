This is a very good, bottom-rated action / drama / and a historical film a little bit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>, Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing villain with characters in this story. Brutally cold and if you look his face it seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely wrong. Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the writer used the word "honor" 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well-acting and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting with the very realistic sword game, but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> All at all just shy in a classic.
