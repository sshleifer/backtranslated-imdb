This movie is as unique as it is overlooked ...... A different story is just that, how it comes from the need to survive or catch, someone can get the love ability if you have a heart open as well an open mind. First, I saw this on the end of the cable late and it really shows the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe that this film was before his time in describing a little slick in a dark way in life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what now shows as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry Kings can be recognized, but they show how far we've come and always have to go where the relationships are concerned.
