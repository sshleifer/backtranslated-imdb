This has the funnist jokes from all the Cheech & Chong flicks. It was the first time I saw with these guys. I found it to be really good. My dad actually recommends me to get it. WHAT is a great model model, and GRANDMA I actually bought it for me, know what it was like. What a family I have. Well this movie is very good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic. I must warn you though, this is not gut-busty funny. It has its moments but not as funny as there is something about Mary. Check it anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless an anti-drug activist or something.
