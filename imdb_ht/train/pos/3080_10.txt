I complained ABC about cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same it might be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life !! Just go to the official site and the rest is simple enough. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and character. The whole concept is to look flu! I'm surprised that my favorite show is about after one set. Why this? Six degrees are phenomena, it's better than many other TV programs out there! Until I heard that she was suspended from a friend she did not even happened to me that this could happen.
