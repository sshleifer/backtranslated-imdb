This comedy with many hardships and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There were many films in this genre and more remarkable actors trying to achieve this elusive blend that has not come anywhere near the depth and adobe of this one. This is surely because the exceptional cast and exceptional performance by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy are so spontaneous that the reality of the characters rapidly influences your interest and emotions and keeps them all the movie. At first, the action looks rather off-the-wall and harebrained, but gradually learns that these two domestic damage damage are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves, though grudgingly, to each other. Rogers' facial facial facial expression seduces Sheedy's shock so easy to say that one feels like one observing them. You will take care of these two likewise but profoundly suffering and hopes that they will succeed because it's doubtful and all hanging on an emotional wireline. Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this movie proves the merits as highly accomplished actors beyond doubt.
