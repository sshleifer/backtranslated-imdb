I watch this movie 10 years ago. and watched her on video an average of once a year since. It's the kind of movie that's timeless, because the universal themes, but the stories and conversations are so personal. It's also one of the very few movies that captures you from one credit to the rolling rollers, despite the fact that there, really, just two (very involved) characters. This must be a lot of committed to acting by Hawke and Delpy, which we believe are actually jested and celine. This is also the first movie I've seen that mentioned reality television, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! I love the movie this way just wrapped the audience in its space and make you think, however jaded you can, that you are one of those characters. It also makes me want to ride the train around Europe! I have not met anyone who could not relate to this movie. Maybe talking about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.
