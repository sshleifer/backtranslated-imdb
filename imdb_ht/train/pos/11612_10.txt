Bride Pictures painted a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for Japanese people who led to Hawaii in the turn of the 19th Century to work in the cane cane fields. Most came planning to return to their country, but some could never do that. Equally scrutinizing is the fate of Japanese women, some genes like fifteen or sixteen, who have been sent as marriage pledges to men only knew in photographs that often were 10 or 15-year from date, or they was in some other smaller ones. They also worked hard time in their field, while fighting homesickness and preserving their dignity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! . There is a grandness and magnificence of the ballet of character and landscape of bride pictures that capture the beauty of Oss as well as violent violence in colonial Hawaii. This is a film that is emotional, intellectually and artistically grateful.
