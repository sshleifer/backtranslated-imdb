I can not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why they think it is sooooo bad etc. It's not worse than anything else out there. My personnel think "Soldier" is a big movie, far better than other films in the same way. <br /> <br /> The reason I loved "soldier" was Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects, and the direct (Paul Anderson). <br /> I even think this is the best work I've seen from the director Paul Anderson, who has already been entertaining fun at "Mortal Kombat" and not so entertaining "Horizon Event".
