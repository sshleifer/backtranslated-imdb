I watched this over the Christmas period, I do not know why but he reminded me of Christmas so I looked at him, so there we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie I watch all the way through with a big smile smiling on my face and its a mix of special performances, great jolly music with a crackling script and wit and charm that causes it . <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that might very hate very easily (spoiled, rich, lazy drink that feels sorry for herself), but turning it into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla a Queen Queens queen who managed to pull on the hard / soft inside of the Arthur lady almost gives up her world for. Jan Gielgud gets all juicy lines and polished off and relish. <br /> I can look at Arthur again and again and still make me feel good, check it out if you need her up a nice movie.
