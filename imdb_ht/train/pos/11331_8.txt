I am not usually forced to write a review for a movie, but the only comment for this movie is far off is rather unfair, so I feel it is necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < did not try to stop from jumping to a bridge, as well as his reasons for doing so. This is the plot of a Nutshell, but this film is not concerned with as many stories it is in describing the guilt of a man who failed to act. As a detective investigating the incident tells her, we usually do not bother to care about the anonymous faces we spend every day until after dying. <br /> <br /> Comparison of Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will be most likely in any review you read about "Krisana." Influence of Antonius's philosophical and moderate style and the history of "Blowup" are clear and, in fact, writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to the movie scene that Matiss attempts to know for the woman who flies over the bridges, or at least those who think it did. Only <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He or she neglected to consider the budget constraints that a Latvian filmist exacerbated most likely to face, but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and sound ambient succeed at an artistic level of loneliness in Matiss. Sound background in wind and street noise lend an ominous aura and remind one of a movie movie film, if you are not what Kelemen's intentions. The movie makers doubtless had little money, but this constraint was used by the film's advantage. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a character study and humor enough to throw in to keep it from being too top-serious. It could easily fall into the myths of a mystery story, but it avoids that and becomes a clever movie about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned with drawing, this movie and end it can frustrate you. Otherwise, take the time to be engaged by it. It is well worth looking out.
