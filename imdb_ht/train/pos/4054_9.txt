The first time I ever saw this film was back in the 1980s as a Wee boy. My dad actually recorded it on the TV. I have been observing more than 20 times before releasing relatively recent DVDs. <br /> <br /> I've been buying and watching the DVD and taken aback by how many the dialogue has changed. In the first version, which I still have on the VHS, the mood of the movie, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is much more funny. <br /> To put it another way, it's like watching the original US release of Akira and Dub, before watching the redman version with literal translation of the Japanese. <br /> I'm not in any way complaining, the story and quality of the animations are not detracted out, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and film theme read .....
