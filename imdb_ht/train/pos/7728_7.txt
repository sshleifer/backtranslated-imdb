THE JUST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This movie was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I can not figure out why. The movie is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "noir" feel. But it's just not fun. It also does not make a lot of sense, in scheme but especially in character motivation. I do not know anyone behaving like these characters. <br /> This is a hard movie taking over - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
