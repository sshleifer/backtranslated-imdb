Life Bugs is a good movie. But for me, it's not really compared to movies like story games and stuff. Do not get me wrong, I loved this movie, but it was not as good as game story. The movie has the visuals, laughter, and others that history games have. But the movie did not feel well as ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of bugs ... I do not mean that's a movie that I do not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I have not seen story games of years, but I still remember it. I should not review this movie, but I am. I give it a thumb, though it's not exactly the best Pixar work done. <br /> <br /> A life insect: *** / ****
