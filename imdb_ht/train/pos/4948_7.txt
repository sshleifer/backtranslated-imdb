This is a simplistic film maker that explores a theme, and gives each visualizer a different thing that is taken from it. The first is simple: a celebrity actor unnamed (Morgan Freeman) decided to search for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people. It takes particular interest in the checkout of "10 articles or less" lines (Paz Vega), who he finds an amiable, strong, and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play in each other brilliant and bring solid dimension to the character of what is a character study. Not a conventional character; Each represents the whole world. The cashier's life infused into a harsh and frustrating "real world," while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he can not perform simple tasks like note phone numbers. He readily admitted that he puts on a face when talking to people, and the whole point of researching real people does not show up on them. <br /> But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work; We see the process reversed as well. Several characters recognize "Him," and refer to how he inspired them and his movie role. <br /> <br /> How is the favorite cashier "Al Pasar Barca," about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers rather than paying (ie: honest work) for boat passage, not can be chosen better. It's parallel to Vega's characters, employees in stores only with any brain or ambition, who want to work hard to succeed. (That's quite an aspiration, for someone who looks like Pegas Vega.) It's an odd little movie, probably made on a shoestring. If you do not mind slow down with a talky approach, this movie will entertain. Characters are perfectly contrasted, and effective to make them endearing. A nice look.
