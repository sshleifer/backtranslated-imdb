Amazing performance from Simon Pegg who just gets better and better with all the roles. As usual it plays a part of a very spitting character that makes you want to hide behind your cushion of embarrassment for him sometimes, but what Pegg is all about. The streets were regular and eye watering and all of them aimed at Penn. The film was very cleverly put together where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with Penn being the only humor that involves a great credit to Robert Weide's Director. <br /> And I cant let this one go without a quick round of applause Gilliam Anderson has been shining at all. Highly recommended for everyone.
