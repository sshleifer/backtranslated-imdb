I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have a day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I do not remember too much about it, but that an American Indian boy lives in a beautiful village with his family, and I do not remember what is happening, but he should go out of the desert alone. His sister packs him some foods and goes away. While it's out there, some other American boys come running out and put some feathers on it, and it turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever saw an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, she is the boy. I've always been fascinating and legendary, particularly American Indian and I would like to see this release a day in a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, anyone concerned!
