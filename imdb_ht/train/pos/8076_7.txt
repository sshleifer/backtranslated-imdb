Family is about two families who are without each other. <br /> <br /> Virus Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a midfielder donated to Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once by mistake he has killed Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren, it also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). Arian (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother is out to take revenge at his brother's death. He was kidnapped by Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The movie has one turn point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to it instead of instead of its dialogue, more affirmative expression. Akshay's Miniscule role has also been placed in par with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala did in this movie. <br /> There are some loose points in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal in the city to still scot-free market in the city. Kidnapping in his family also seemed vague. How does the family like a great donation have no security coverage?
