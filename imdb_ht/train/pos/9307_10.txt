Not a movie for everyone, but this film is in my mind 10. I'm a guy in black comedy. With a cast including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'bras ball' London) in their drive, the lines can not help but be dry. Thrust in support is almost dead. Countless minor shortages in the movie: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her face a wash look out; There was a couple of gimme cameras by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who served no purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screen was too short. Over all, the cast was just amazing to destroy a good script. If you've seen Larry Bishop's movie (writer, director), midfielder (a movie crime movie), you'll enjoy this one. His next scout (writer, director, actor) is the Army Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
