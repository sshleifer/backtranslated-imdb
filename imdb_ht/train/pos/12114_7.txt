This film is obviously low-budget & filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The objects were to be overcome to make this film persuaded (set in California & late 60's-80's) were well designed. I believe this is the best and most accurate version of zodiac killers that plagued the city of Vallejo & the Bay area from 1968-19? (he never caught) .Edward James Olmos (Det Dave Toschi) & George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the moment believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen, since authorized by DNA & fingerprints) play a game of chat & mouse re-visit crime scene sets each individual trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation. Olmos dies in some types of terminal disorders and knows Dzundza did it, still totally obsessed at the point of losing his family & becoming a full-blown alcohol la.Dzundza is totally oblivious and self absorbed (like any serial killer) of the carnage left in his wake. The only disappointment was "on top" to finish otherwise very accurate. If you are in the typical Hollywood tire or Do you have an interest in the Zodiac case, look at it.
