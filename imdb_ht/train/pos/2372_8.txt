Just watch this after my mother brought her back from America for me, being daunting watching this after all the negative comments about here, but I must say, yes the act is cheese , some of the effects are ridiculous. /> But you must remember this was meant to be 1898 by 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was quite good. I liked this more version then the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> I have read the book many times and found myself going "ahh wi is in the book" almost all the time, and the other version hardly anything in the book existed. So well done for at least trying to make a true version.
