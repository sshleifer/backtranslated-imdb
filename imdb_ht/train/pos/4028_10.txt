I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviews posted here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood movie and was born and raised in the US. So I do not have a big base to compare Pinjar in other Indian films. Luckily, no comparison is needed. Pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a prince. <br /> In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films from any studio anywhere at any time. On a mass-scale scale, she * could * have been the American equivalent of "Tanga Crouching, Hidden Dragon" she was well promoted in the U.S.. This could very well be the movie that puts Bollywood on the American map. The American movie-go public has a longtime love affair and "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from this draw has some similarity. Not least of which is the monstrous (by US standard) 183 minute running time. <br /> Put against the bravest cloth of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned in circumstances and pushing into trouble she had no hands in creating. Put in a positive position, it somehow manage not only survive, but to grow - and even bloom. <br /> <br /> If the story lacks any way, it's the display. The puro (protagonist) growth as a man would be best illustrated - at least for Western audiences familiar with Indian culture - if "back story" its characters were more developed in the early part of the movie. But that would have stretched a movie 3 hours to 3 1/2 hours or maybe even more. Because not a minute in the film is wasted, and none of which made it out of correction can really be cut for the sake of time. The best that the audience has to fill in some of what came before they left out of that. <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "intensely", "disturbing", "compelling", "heart-wrenching" come to mind instantly. But "expand" is perhaps as much as any of these. Any story that shows up the indestructibility of the human mind against the worst of chances to be considered. And Puro's triumph - while possibly not immediately obvious to that around him - is not less than inspiration. For the strength of my own story, I can not recommend this movie pretty much. <br /> <br /> Equally inspired is the painting of Urmila Matondkar in Puro. All too often neglected among the furthest of younger, new actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver a completely credible character to any role she plays. It does not just act the Puro party, it breathes life into the character. Selection of the Bajpai Manoj as Rashid was inspired. It manages something far too few American movie heroes can: finer. Its command of expression and nuance is essential to the role. He brings more threats to the early part of the movie and persuades his mind than everyone who came into the sword-touch combined. <br /> <br /> If you only see one movie Bollywood in your life, do it Pinjar.
