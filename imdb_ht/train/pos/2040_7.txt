CREEP is a real-screen screen that is recorded in real-time that wants nothing more than just shows people getting attacked in a blank empty platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And it does so only. There is nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith drew out the drama as he plausibly can not introduce a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the train after he closed. He also quit the origins of the Creep Seventeen Wave (illegal experiences happening in the underground 60s are hinted at) and that little of mystery worked for the most part. Unfortunately, it disruptes itself to the end by actually holding back from an end to twisting where more genetic malformation would appear (they were hinted as well). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a clawed twist to finish! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potan is adequate lead to female terrorist and the rest of the cast is fine.
