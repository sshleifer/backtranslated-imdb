The invisible Ray is an excellent display of both talent and acting at Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff pulls into an impeccable performance as a bite and conflict scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationship with others, even his wife. Her personality has already become unbearable as she becomes paranoid. Lugosi plays the consumer intent, who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to keep on good terms with everyone, but still seems to be no real friend proch. This was one of her few roles as a good guy and she plays it very well. It is difficult, however, to hear her accent and believe she is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. Since their ideas and theories are completely idiocy, they are as "important" today as they were when the movie was made. And they are also as forward-and constantly. <br /> <br /> This is a perfectly suited movie to watch again and again. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit in it five times more. The act is wonderful and the fun science. I highly recommend it.
