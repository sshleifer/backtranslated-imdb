With all that goes into the world we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated scheme or deep meaning; however it is not devoid of substance. There are more than furious or dramatic drama actions. There are good little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date. Try it you can love it more than you think. The little girl is really clever and beautiful. "The father" and the girl go through some slapstick routines. When a companion is jealous of the stage, mixed mixes for curly and the life of shi are known to be worn out. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play the role of thorough crust above and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fairy tale as duo of the streets with wise homeless drifters. Worlds collide and comedy happen.
