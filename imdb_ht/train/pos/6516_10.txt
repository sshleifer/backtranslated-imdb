hello. I just watch this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I'm a story teacher who has too much time on my hands. I need a life. I found the movie with a striking resemblance to break back mountain. I also found that I looked very much like Jean Lafitte if he was white. Also, my favorite line of the movie all came from Mr. Petey - "This baby can shoot a chipmunk's eye from 300 yards !!" oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came in, with the one drummer who was so devoted to his work, and he drummed until death, as if this drum could end the war all together .... but it would not. Well, what I would like to say about this movie. OH, one more thing..bony brown is a physical bipolar atmosphere of BEEYOTCH vibrant. that's all.
