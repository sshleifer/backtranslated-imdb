One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in the American history began. The members of the summer culture of love, the end of the sixties and the emergence of the 80, were eventually old tools for love beads and night parties and evolved back to mainstream life, whichever means. For those who could not grow juvenile and sometimes irrational caverns, they were the culture of Wonderland. A love for drugs with a sense of right coupled with a waste of authority, value and the "establishment" is the world that the film captures. The surprise was a time of revolution and violent change that tore the "home" of the American apartheid. Once the battles were over, we all faced the consequence of the carnage. The characters in Wonderland homes are icons in the misfits of the Seventies; party biker, hippie party, party thief, all outcast. There is no ideology expressed, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and nothing at risk. Ron, Billy and David fancy themselves as some sort of Robin Hoods and drugs. They talk of love and behave strongly; They take the rich, and sell them as slaves. stolen from everyone. Holmes and companies are the result of the end of a strange collision of anti-topics such as gender, and drugs with rock & roll, when the laboratory technicians get bored and moved on. The film is skillfully directed and rhythmically captured the frenetic world of the drug drugs in the elements. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.
