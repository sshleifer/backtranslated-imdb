I must admit, at first I did not expect anything good, at all. I just expected a Gackt's cheesy film and Hyde's image, but I'm glad to say it has more to offer .. Yes, the act is not great, but it does not suck either, all the thoroughly disciplined cast and carry enough strength for the characters. Effects of lack of consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough. <br /> <br /> What really hooked me was the essence of the storyline, although it merged fantastic elements, it also shows a bit realistic. The development of the characters, the doubts and feelings really got on me and I think it's the key to this movie. It puts you thinking and it does well transmit all the bitterness. <br /> It meets any expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
