The show is really funny. Beautiful theme. Jokes and a lyric are really good. With little extra tuning it can become a very popular show. But only the big negative point of this show is the throw. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Cost does a great job. But who the hell has cast Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. Technically Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, which makes viewers want to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family, Wiz Relationship ... and an experience of all these issues a married couple face in a relationship. <br /> Patrick Warburton - doing a terrible job as Jeff, he is not at all suited for the role. It's like a robot, literally having no punch in his dialogue delivery. <br /> <br /> Put really very important for viewers to love it. The bad act certainly will take the show down ...
