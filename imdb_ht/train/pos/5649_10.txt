I'm watching the series again now that it's out on DVD (yay!) It hit me as cool, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first revealed. <br /> <br /> The central performances are adapted, the scripts are layered. <br /> I'll stick my neck out and put it up with the prisoner as a show that will win new fans and always look up coming 2035. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was asked to write some More lines (it looks like IMDb is as unfriendly and anally retentive user coded as ever!) Pithy and to the point are clearly not the IMDb path.) Well, unlike editor submits IMDb, American Gothic Understand that the simplicity is everything. In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows done in seven seasons. On top of it's personal ethics and strengths of character in a way that challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. First, I was still sad for Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap hit. Personally I start to rate it more highly and suspects it will be better over the years. Make sure she does not get more controversial than that!
