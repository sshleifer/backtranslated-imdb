Fault, the Nobel Prize winner of the poet Simon Grim poet, still loves Henry Crazy. The sons receive a basic-in-a-box ingenuity from a watchman and a jerk across the three continents indicated, involving a superb tris-bag collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops . Parker Posey delivers a perfectly timed comedy performance, including some brilliant physical work. With great contribution by Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Grim Faust proves to be the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good note by Hartley (and thanks to the American Academy of Credit in Berlin, where Hartley served as a fellow in autumn 2004).
