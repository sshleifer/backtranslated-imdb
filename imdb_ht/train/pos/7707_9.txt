As did others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I ran to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi and people find the way ticket "all can follow and enjoy this film story and scheme very well. on a planet other than Earth in the 20th century than series such as "Flash Gordon." Leslie Nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at this time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all liberated themselves very well. There are many beautiful visuals in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the movie scene. The Altair-4 approach, the vessel itself, the landing on foreign surfaces The planet, the descendant through stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach to the rocket-roll, Dr. Morbius's house saw from the blood and out, the underground complex and its wonderful, the setup in the gun, the battle with the monster, the ultimate approach to the unlucky destruction destroyed, escape from the planet Out the scenes engraved in the viewer's mind because we discover them together with the participants. Cyril Hume's literary veteran study has filmed intelligence by Fred McLeod Wilcox's direct director and clear and imaginative. It is a shock to achieve no music at all; The film is brought to the words, actors and storyline-revelations of the storyline. It can look again and again with fun - I did this for almost fifty years. Until this film was famous and well loved created, no movie tried to imagine a world beyond Earth; and for decades later, pirates kept crashing back on the planet - as if the imagination writers were failing and causing accidents. Still the best, many say. That says something negative about so-called intellectual leaders of this nation - and something very positive indeed I suggest about who did this gem.
