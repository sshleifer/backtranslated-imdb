<br /> <br /> All is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this eleven series by eleven director. This means that what would be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, may not be so many others, ordinary people. From the opening stage of an Iranian teacher trying to impress on her little student the most important thing that happened, and the result children are not impressed, as the death of a neighbor and things as obviously affect them more closely than anything that happened in New York, USA, whichever, this series of almost documented style styles has established that not everything is equal to everyone as some world leaders would try to report. But, obviously, the attack on the WTC was a dastardly event by any yardstick, one finds the impression that both politicians and cameramans tend to blow up things from everywhere - beautifully manifested in one piece these. Would they be the same reaction at international level if the attack was made about Lagos, say, or Djakarta, say, or even in Rio de Janeiro, saying? I prefer not to think. News seems to suffer from deformation depending on where it happens: more time TVs provide an earthquake in Italy, say, over ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia, says. Larger distance seems to reduce the size of the disaster. This series of eleven pieces helps put things in better perspective - or, perhaps, I should say, some of the pieces to do, as each director and full freedom made up his own story, his own translated perspective, as it is not possible to judge all the merits, but individually for each eleven minute segment. <br /> In no way should one be deduced that this is an anti-American movie: that would be a too simple reading of the various messages manifested in the segments. However, it is not pro-American either. The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and common links - if there is one - is that the disaster of the WTC attack must be seen from perspective from different viewpoints. Only then will people like George Bush even begin to understand the planet he lives on. <br /> <br /> Clearly stated in one segment is a belief I've been harboring for two years now: America has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that the USA has to share this planet with the rest of mankind - not dominating it without merciless economic persuasion or just plain power. Instead of learning that the USA can not just stamp on everyone and everywhere, its political leaders, assist and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, who are not doing any which is good for anyone in Afghanistan or Iraq right now, is alone very much elsewhere. The White House mentality is totally rejectable: The U.S. and UK invaded Iraq and caused all the mess, and thus should clear up the disruptions caused - by insisting on the UN and other nations digging in with one helping hand and thus finding an easy way out of the turmoil. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So unnecessary, ie, stoning women to death or simply enveloping them from the heads of the dirt soil. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by greed in a wealthy country that looks bent on seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film of eleven pieces separated by this show posture and mute posture.
