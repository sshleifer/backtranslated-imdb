Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography I think not. This movie is not too terrible but it was not much better than average. The main story of dealing with very immoral youth should focus more on the prohibited romance and why this was ... really should come to it instead of scratching the surface and basically "because mom says we can not." Some parts should have collapsed altogether or the rewards are most important in the combat of the two main characters. Couple times I asked if the writer / director was a fan of classical classic George Lucas' American Graffiti. Not that it's wrong to be a fan of film but to make your movie at times look like that, I mean come on! The worst part of this was that Madchen Amick was like a small party, I mean double coming over !! It was the only one, in one or two lines, which actually tried a southern accent. (Have a good listener, even though her character came from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she's star other people could follow and we would have had a more authentic movie sounding. Well, what can be done when you have a director of just one director and not an artist, too. Too bad. Generally I give this a B- and this is a little generous' cause I'm part of Ms. Amick.
