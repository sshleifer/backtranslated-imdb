Herbert Clutter, Bonnie's wife, and Kenyon and Nancy's young children loved and respected them in small towns in Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959 all the cards were brutally murdered. Instead of expectations, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who runs the scene and follows the course in the case of its conclusion. The result is the book IN Cold Blood. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well written, he became an international seller best and remains a touchstone for crime writers on that day. <br /> <br /> The movie movie version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life places, it has a quality quality document, ice and tear - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the movie that Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deserves that. As Killer Perry Smith, Blake your trap between a deep distaste and the trauma of unexpected sympathy; It is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine. <br /> Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to the clutter home - the only sudden flash past crime in the investigation details that finally emerged from arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film was still the moment in which we at last saw what was happening in the Clutter House; Actually filmed in the Clutter House itself, it is a spiral, terrible and deeply disturbing sequence. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks guided the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that it allowed the movie to become a little preachy. Given the overall power of the movie, however, this becomes a trivial inconvenience. Strong stuff - and recommended. <br /> GFT, Amazon Review
