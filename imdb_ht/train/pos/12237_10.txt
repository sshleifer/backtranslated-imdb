Game Mating is a good, wonderful movie from an era gone by. Hollywood needs to consider a good rumor of this movie. My wife and I would go to see her. <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I look at AMC. This film has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> Love it. We have plans on DVD over to add to the growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Too Hollywood does not make movies like this again. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... time for digging some of the types of scripts from the old security, updated a bit (without spoiling the original movie and script as you do with other rumors), and hold a casting call. there would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD, and on cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
