I thought this film was excellent, for the fact that Corrine and Sean were just coming into the business. It was packed with a little romance, but there was some point when Corrine did not speak very clearly he threatened Sean and guns) and did his tooth teeth ... maybe he was supposed to be? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were described very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I look next to the action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean do their own exhibit, which did very well. Forward to another movie by the fear, as they do a great team, or maybe a sequel to your life bet - maybe called 'making it big in the big apple', it could have been this time on Carmen. Your life bet is excellent!
