There is no denial that Ealing comforts are good, but for me this movie means from one of the best. <br /> <br /> The first quiz of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London discovered to be part of burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents of the battles to keep the treasure found after explosion the bomb, and keep out the black market volumes that soon realize that being exempted from UK law, rationing does not exist. Being arrested on their own streets because the government has decided to close the retiree we see them fighting against the system. They are forced to ration water and feed in their stands for what is right. In fact, worse than before it all began, this is where the morale comes in. It's when they drop all the foods that they think they beat and call for a surrender, only they are all there in London responded to the plight by sending food, much of it. So allow them to continue their fights. This film hit in the right note at all, the act is superb, and Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren stand out. It's just just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story does not force your throat. Well worth a look
