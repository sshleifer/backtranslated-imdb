I'm not sure I understand where all these anti-rudge people are talking about here, maybe it's just that some people like to get things going on. The film was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some cases had difficulty with the time changes, all actors too want to go where I would really rather not go, etc.) but IMHO had some things that are more than made up for flaws them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ALWAYS when you leave the house haunting the baddies leaving you alone, giving us time to recongroup, find friends, and find the mysterious paranormal type sign. NORMAL (semi-spoiler alerts) when you are hidden under the covers can only find you in that little opening you look at. Normally at the end of the ghosts somehow became less creepy because you found out they're just misunderstood, or were released, or whatever. Second, production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly the special-effect-loaded supernatural bits while short was very well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best sort of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate sort of horror (there's nothing to do about them, they've got their seats) but great for those began to take the conventions to be granted and no problem with time deformation.
