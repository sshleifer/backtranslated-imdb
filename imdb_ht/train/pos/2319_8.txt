<br /> It's a generic coming-of-age story - thinking "Member of the Wedding," "summer of '42," "a summer summer," the same "girls" - and there are moments where Mulligan might leave the soupy music, do not use slow-moving, or played down the gold-lit beauty of the environment. Otherwise, it does with scarce perfect emotional-pitch. There is nothing forceful, each line has feelings, and the rhythm is just right. Even the Listing below-A-list helps: The largest movie star with more recognizable personality could have the overwhelmed material. In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: its reading is cool and original, and its body language is just right for a gawky, 14-year-old hoydenish on the eve of womenhood. Waterston is also very well, though it has spent much of the film climbing in and out of the family truck. <br /> One sense that the movie maker was aware of its independence of commercial prospects - no big star, no big car crashes, no special effects - and consciously decided to make the best movie possible, box office will be sentenced. It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs. If you find yourself misting up in the end, you do not have to feel you've been scam.
