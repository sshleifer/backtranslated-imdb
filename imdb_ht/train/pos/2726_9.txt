This movie stands with classic all the time. Music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. Showing the black and white film gave it a better appearance and complement the music perfectly, such as psycho. It's surprising how some people commented on this movie. I guess is that it's a hard movie to get. I gave the movie a 9. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
