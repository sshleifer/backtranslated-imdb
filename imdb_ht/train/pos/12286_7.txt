I loved the movie, first of all because he told an interesting story, but the story as they said in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much longer story. Since the book is more than 400 pages, making sense. It spans a long period from the 1920's in the 1970's, to a fictional South American country, also a lot of fit in the time available. I think it would be best as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out to be a 140-minute movie. Even if it's running, the story does not skip so much that it gets confused. What was said was said fairly well. A fault is that Clara's supernatural power appears consistent; either should appear more evenly in the movie, or they should have left out. The more wrong (that would be crowded): Esteban's return eventually in goodness happens a bit too sudden, and the Curse Ferula seems to put in, though the tone of the story suggests that it should be kept forever. The act is excellent. Glenn Closed, as the tormenting torment Ferula, is exceptional. Jeremy Irons, as brutal man-made man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is great, although it is often often better than he was in this movie. There were many well-to-do roles. The biggest mistake is that the movie seemed to miss a dialect trainer; Each actor seemed to speak of a different sort of accent.
