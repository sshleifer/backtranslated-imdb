This is by far one of the best films made and did not let me shame at all. Tracking the sound with finely shot hands-held camera work was exquisite. They are still lucky that a movie will not hold such beliefs as well as another, but I felt that the rhythm of this picture and the distribution was excellent. Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming a discontinued in films that require a child who has an ancient soul personality and has never been ashamed of her talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest place in mankind trying to move in the light.
