A desperate guy for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl on a bus. He denied it, but when he kicked someone who tried to steal his purse to get along anyway. And it begins - a relationship that is slightly attached by the fact that it is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. <br /> In short, a story that could promise to grow out of a cool movie. And IMO, he succeeded in being a beautiful movie. She has no masterpiece, but it was my tears from laughing over more than one occasion - the two lead twirling characters around each other in a love like crazy that is, even with the superhero stuff going away, credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thousands of stories, but worked out really funny and so worthy of time movies. <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
