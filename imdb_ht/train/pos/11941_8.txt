They are not icing journalist Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from his "Friday girl" or detective fingers William Powell and sassy Lady Myrna Loy from Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are amazingly good amateur sleuths of scoops. Greedy reposting is more postmodern than post depression, writes Allen's full and addictive ironic and pleasurable ancient New York Angst. All the blacks of the old understood come rarely, as when he, like Sid, the Great Splendini magician, responded to his background: "I was born to convince the Hebrews, but when I got older I converted to narcissism." Johansson, cool from the Allen Match Match as a bad girl, here comes a relatively good, sometimes ditsy journalist student to take in a murderous murder mystery to London: a serial killer. The plot is an appointment at his latest London-based Point Riot riddle, right down to the top-class and "American Tragedy" / Place in the "crash" boat. As a matter of fact, Allen is reworking the Mystery Assembly of Manhattan and Red Rose in Cairo to name just a couple of other examples. I do not care if it reworks; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the original and, alas, it is just a reflection of its greatest. <br /> <br /> Allen as director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore take a substandard comedy in an appropriate place down the Allen Cannon , not great, but fun, at brilliant satirical times: About the suspect high-grade murderer, Sid (Allen), "I would be very surprised if he killed one man." This is Vintage Allen Humor. While there are barely any literary illuminations like in most of his films, he scouts and music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky, and Strauss tell us that Woodman has not lost his interest in the class.
