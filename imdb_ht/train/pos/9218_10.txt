First, let me say I wanted to see this movie for a year now because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion in the movie. Anyhow, no video store brought it, but low and seeing the local library did. I looked at her and she really liked. Yes there was Italian stereotypes but it did good and humorous. It did not degrade in any way. <br /> Each actor and actress did a superb job. I laugh very hard in the sexual humor. In general, I think this film is well worth seeing if you can find it. It is adorable and just plain fun to watch. I rarely ranked movies as a 10 but I give this one a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Go get it and watch it!
