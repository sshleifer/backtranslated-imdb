I passed through "Bait" on one night cord just as he started and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. It suffered two directions unnecessarily flashy and patient occasionally. But in general, this movie worked. All elements aligned just right, and they pulled on what could have been a very ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Most of that, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know what Foxx is for the lead, but whoever he has made this movie a great favor. Believable and amazingly love, foxx slides in the movie, list as butter and funnier than hell. You can say that it works on instinct, and instincts do not fail it. <br /> <br /> The plot, while crucial, actually links very well, and there is even an archive character in which Foxx's character grows as a human. Once again, they could have slipped by without any of this, but it just does the best thing. <br /> I am surprised at the low rating for that. Maybe I just keep this move on the right nights, or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, MSSR. Foxx.
