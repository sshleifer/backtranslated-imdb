I saw this film at Haifa's 18th film festival, and it is one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on a big screen (and I mean big, none of these most cinema movies have) and an excellent sound system still enhances the cinematic experience, as the movie takes on your eyes and ears and sucks you into The story, in the picture. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a series of characters, which is inter-connected wounds. The cross stories of certain points, and multiplication of story lines remind me so much of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which gives the series for the entire movie. It houses the characters, has pavements and roads on their way to walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautiful scenes scenes. The movie returns again and again to certain terms (shoes, for example), and in essence Salazar does his metaphor more and more to the viewer's view as the movie progresses. It combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters, and chatting powerfully feel at the scene in the background. A set of talented actors helps him portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the stage in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me bouncy goose easily on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The message in the movie is very positive, and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times. The music along the movie is usually pop, and some instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the band one day, although I'm seriously skeptical I'll). <br /> All together, I came from this film with a sensational feeling, and I'm not impressed with it (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10.
