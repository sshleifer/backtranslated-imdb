Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. A married woman (Lucy) arrives in the home of her family (Mathurin) in France, where they are expecting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry (meet a willingness.) While waiting , Lucy young learns about a legend in a pre-existing land cave. In the night bed, she starts to fantasize about the animal and her regroup-turned-consensual sadness and former lady at home. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is really very thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick), but the cinematic rewards (?) Those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious final. /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for great movies, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a far-out movie about bequering (which almost casts a look on the subject) this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of this one. Outside of some horse-on-horse action at the start, the 'deeds' are very cartoonish, IMO)
