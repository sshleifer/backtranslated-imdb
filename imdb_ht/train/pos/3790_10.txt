I tuned to this by accident on the independent movie channel and was riveted. I'm a professional actor and I was flabbergasted by their performance. They felt totally impromptu, absolutely without affecting. I could not say if it was scripted or how it was shot and waiting until the very end to seeing credit and then spent half an hour on the IMDb to get this movie. Do not miss it. I saw that the writer-director also made a very well-known movie called People Every day I enjoyed so much. The shame of the film business is that this excellent project does not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves to be proud and proud. I encourage people to look at her and look at her.
