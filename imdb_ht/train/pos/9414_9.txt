Although most Americans have no knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produces an amazing body of work - particularly in the 1940s - 1950s - from the original comedy drama. I particularly love his comedy, as they are so well-done and looks so natural and real on the screen - far different from the usual fare from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This was said, this was the movie that sparked my interest in these movies. It's drawn was so odd and beautiful that it is very easy to have the movie done anywhere - except for Ealing Studios - which has a particular fondue for "small" movie like this one. <br /> Guinness is a little nerdy scientist who works for a fabric company. She wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, even if it does not work for the company as a researcher, but for working outdoors! So it tends to sneak into laboratories (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand to invent. Repeat, it is kept (as after it blows the lab) and gives the boot until one day it actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, it lays on a completely unanticipated chain of events - and then the fun begins. and people in general.
