I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I liked Rolf in this role and liked the other role she was in. I can not believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as flaming Hudson's good friend in the series. When this show was revealed in the New York City area, it was still late at night or at times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should go on longer but the timing changes in the second quarter really made the show a little less interesting. I did not care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show was lucky and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or tried out their British counterparts. I also loved the fact that they tried to internationalize the cast rather than to make them all the British. I like to look Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should be longer. I felt at times that the forecasts lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They were able to transfer cast to New York City and would be a hit in America.
