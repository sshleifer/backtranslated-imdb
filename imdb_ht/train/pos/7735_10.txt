An excellent interpretation of the novel Jim Thompson, this neo-noir comedy has all the requisite elements - disrupting old boxing turning drifter, alcohol vagabonds and disaster desires, formerly shot small-thief, and a kidnapping scheme that is destined for bankruptcy . But the film never crosses into clich√©, but remains fresh and intriguing. Their performance is all superb, particularly Bruce Dern's role as the evil sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a uncertainty of tension in the movie motion which, intentionally or not, adds to the grim processes. Very recommended.
