This movie was almost an imaginative movie. A mix of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and physical history. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, directed by Kathleen Turner's perfectly cast, this movie has everything to go for it. Everything, but value production. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or great budget, but with a top output like this, it comes with the same simple quality as each other made for TV movie. In addition to the best movies, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
