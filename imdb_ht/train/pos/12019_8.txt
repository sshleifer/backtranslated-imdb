I saw this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago .. I must admit, it was a really good Western feature that features 2 of the big names .. On the one hand, there's Charlton Heston, playing the infamous law and taking retirement Samuel Burgade. On the other .. The late James Koburn plays Zach evidence of Zach .. seeking revenge on Burgade does not matter what the price ..! The good thing about this movie was some really good characters. .. Most of the actors played it out really well .. Especially James Coburn, whom I find that he really meant in this movie .. But how it was .. <br /> Christopher Mitchum who I've seen everywhere in other films .. Play Hal Brickman .. I felt his character left out of the cold, but he managed to get himself back in by teaming up with Burgad, bringing down the posse to Prose a! /> All in all, it was a great movie .. Very good to watch .. Great note from the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> Wonderful Western character ..! 8 out of 10.
