Like the Tarzan Man Ape (1932), only so much. There's more to everything, more animals, more varied African tribes, and the scene that was thought to be, if this was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan wrestles and crocodiles ?? The crocodile machine turns into the water like a rolling pin, around and everywhere, jam flapping. Tarzan can kill him with his ubiquitous knife if the injury surgery would keep up. Tarzan kills lions and rhinoceroses with a steady increase in animals. Her friends are real chimps, people wearing big costume suits, and elephants. In fact, they use the American elephants ... far from friendly and tranquil than African and adorable costumes attached to themselves. The human story: another white man, worse than the rest, shows up to join with Holt to go after the elephant in the elephant's graveyard. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the bad guy throws an elephant to follow him in his deathbed. Tarzan is forbidden, and the bad guy? But of course, she survives and returns to save Jane. All others die, Holt and the bad guy and all one of the "boys". People are over, especially Africans, and there are not many differences between dark friends who have died because they work for the white guys to travel to the taboo countries and the black people who kill them. This must be the latest film in Tarzan before the Hays Code has made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims naked, and even though the light is flickering the movement and glimpses are very appealing. Apparently one of Weismuller's friends from the Olympic Swimming team made the nude scenes, and not Maureen O'Sullivan. He, however, moved into the film to put the same sort of linen weothuller wear (plus a bikini head), showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip. They still do not need to talk much. They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from their town. No wonder they are happy.
