This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh loudly. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism from forecasts, well-politically correct. There is no here, unless you define sex as a woman as a housewife and racist as a family employing a colored surface maid. The lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. If you've ever thought of or tried to build a new home, you will be relieved that no matter how upset the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves can feel, you are not alone!
