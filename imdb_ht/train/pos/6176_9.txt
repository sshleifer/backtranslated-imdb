The 1986 television film in the Spirit was a pilot for a possible set. However, Creator Spirit Will Eisner did not like the movie and thus has no product range. I thought it was a very fun movie and captured the spirit (sorry) in the comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry he did not concretize in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Visitor was a beautiful Ellen Dolan and of course later going to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's big-screen version of the Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare jet in spiritual history. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie out of an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably seek previous versions of the property and disclose it to the videos in order to make a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas donned Zorro's mask, we were able to find earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the great Delon version of the 1970s (although all the copies I've ever seen have been seriously edited). But hope that someone will release the TV adventure in the DVD spirit soon.
