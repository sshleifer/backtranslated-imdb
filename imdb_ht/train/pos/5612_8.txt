In Paris, Trelkovsky witnessed shy and insecure (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without toilets where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The Chelying Concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough owner Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) established strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels up dog by his neighbors. Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends his girlfriend (Isabelle Adjani). After the death of Simone, Trekovsky feels obsessed for her and believes her homeowners and neighbors draw a plot to forced her to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The Freelance "The Tenant" is a disturbing and creepy story of paranoid and arrogance. The story and the process of frenzy and loss of identity in the Trelkovsky alone are slowly developing into a nightmare atmosphere in the horrible place of his apartment, and what's happening is totally unpredictable. Performance is awesome with Isabelle Adjani very nice. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
