The best way to describe Europe, which is high on my favorite movie list, is the exclamation from a companion after the movie ended: "I did not know that movie could be made like that". Entirely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what movies can be. It's as far away in the "master and cover" style of shooting as one can get; Fully integrated many layers of image, sound, effect, accessory, dialogue, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... all equal, no dominant. Despite the "dialogue" Hollywood's myopia dialogue, movies are not about dialogue, nor are it on beautiful lighting or music activities. It works better when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the blender of the elements, in the order or combination of which they present, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate contributions of one element, and the movie has no sense. "Europe" is what movies should strive to be.
