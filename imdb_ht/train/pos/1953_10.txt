Since this film was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off, she was just scared as to how real she really is! The act is what gave the film to big push. Diane Keaton describes the main character, Patsy McCartle who had two sons she worshiped. His performance is what made the real life story come to life on a TV screen. It was very difficult to look at some of the scenes since they were so real as it happens when one becomes addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> Just watching this very loving mother goes out of sweet does not care at all was tough, but so true. I knew who was going to retire and he was very much like what happened in this film, from what I remember. I also thought he was very risky for the director to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. But he did so well. I applaud the director for making this movie. <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone who knows someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or just learning what can happen to you if you become addicted.
