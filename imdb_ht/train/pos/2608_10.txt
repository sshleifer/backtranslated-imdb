The final season of Roseanne was a crazy roller coaster ride. This final episode does just a comment before saying, saying to us as many as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not. Roseanne came back in one season, and told us that this show was pronounced in her life. He said in the final episode that he changed events with people as he saw fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David marry opposing wives in real life, and Dan died when he lived. As events happened in his life, he changed them to writing. Not all of us could do that. Not all of us have a moment of time that we wish we could just use a gloomy and change to our taste. This is what he did with the whole episode. And in another comment I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real to my mind, it just changed the way events occurred in their lives. A A + ends in A + show !!!!
