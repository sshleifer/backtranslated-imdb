The third and last part of the trilogy of Bourne (duh), lacking a bit of the story department, but cover it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular takes up some of the time to run and make this movie much better. The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second film was well ... advanced story-wise. How were they around this? Scenes of action, for once, but they did something else, which I can not reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you will notice it! Wet enough I read, that the adaptation of the Bourne books is the most accurate least of all three films .. if that means anything you: o)
