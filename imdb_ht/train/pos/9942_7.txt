A good Korean movie about not just Taekwondo but it takes to be good, as a way thugs in battles can not beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules, as there are in life and school and this movie was luxurious this notion. <br /> The martial arts of the film is not that good but it is beams and enjoyable. Friends who are going to realize something they once would be mocking become stronger in the mind and heart. This film does not mean that it should be taken too seriously as it has slapstick, but it also brings a message. <br /> A good movie again in Korea.
