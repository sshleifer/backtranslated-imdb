Rosenstrasse is a story that touches the courage of adversity. Women Reichdeutch found that the Jewish husband was locked up dependent on deportation. One of the aristocrats deposed by his family, Lena Fischer, finds himself in the crowd as Gudarian's General Sister. But rank and merit privileges have no special consideration. No service in the Reich as a prisoner whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn. In one of the most horrific scenes of the movie, the guards took the wedding band to her husband's husband. <br /> <br /> If you think this is our typical German brutishness in America today Lady Bush unjustly commands the arrest of Gold Star Mother (mother of US service-members died in action) because many presences are offencive. Little, regrettably, has changed in the 60 years from Der Fuher's Der Fumbler. Fortunately, eight-year-old Ruth's daughter saved her capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is first reluctant to take in Ruth answering in a way that we take as typical German. Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach who is aware of and opposes Holocaust's preoccupation with Lena. but Lena chose to embrace the idea with an American rebellion even renamed Ruth, the more agenda called Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The Siege ends favorably on Rosenstra√üe but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Year after Hannah, Ruth's daughter was expelled from research into her mother's past and satisfied 90-year-old Lena under the guise of writing a personal story of the war. <br /> I did it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look at the family, but never checked over the fate of her grandfather last known to be served on the Ostfront.
