People who are not familiar with Elvira changed-Cassandra Peterson, then this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress in the Dark" starts off with our heroine and gravity challenging boobs receiving a message. It seems that a great aunt has died and that he needs to be present for the reading of the will. Worrying to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting a lot and lots of money. Unfortunately, where he was gone is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having lived a spell due to his crushing machine, he found that his big aunt left 3 things: a home, a dog and a book. The city's residents have mixed reactions: young people like it, women hate it, and the lustful guys after it (although trying to stay in the community). The worst problem it turned out to be from Vincent Vincent Vincent (Morgan Sheppard), because he wants to eat it. Suggest that the cook is an ornate book that will make it a more powerful warlocker. The movie is actually very funny, and Peterson aka Elvira using her "endearance" and sexiness as a joke ("And remember, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things ... I mean the thing with two head "). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works harder to keep the city in line but ends up looking ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Be a peek (the movie, not her sess, of course).
