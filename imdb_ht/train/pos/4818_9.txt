I still have a bit of challenging before watching the British period films because I usually get over to insipid and boring scenario (like those that, for example, Fairness Fairies or the other Boleyn Girl), but with a production design magnificent, European landscapes and those British accents that make the movies suggest artistic value that they do not really have .Fortunately, the film Young Victoria 's excellent film does not fall on this situation, and she deserves an enthusiastic recommendation in history Its fascinating, excellent performance from Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, with the costumes and places that are unexpectedly making the film very rich in the look. And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not pay too much attention to these details. <br /> "Victorian era" was (in my modest views) one of the key points of contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also in scientific, artistic and cultural ones.B as I honestly do not knowing about the origins of this era, and perhaps because of what I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that prepared the landing of modern era. I also liked the way in which Queen Victoria is described as a young and intelligent monarch whose decision was not always good but was at least inspired by good intentions. I also found the presentation of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intelligence as well as in the emotions he recalls. Only the failure I found on this movie is that senarist Julian Fellowes uses some candles in the romantic cinema on the love story, something that feels a bit out of place on his scenario. /> <br /> I love the Young Victoria very much, and I really took a very nice surprise with her. I hope more film period follows the example of this movie: The costumes and landscapes should work as the support of a interesting stories, and not as substitutes in it.
