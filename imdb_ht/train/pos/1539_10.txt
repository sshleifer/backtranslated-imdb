I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe this is Mr Blom's first director, she is pretty rhythm and feast. The great cast of characters can come from a novel Anne Tyler, layer and return history and potential futures, no fake scores, surprising bursts of humor among self-inflicted self-inflicted and very real if not dilemmas earth- break. If you've seen "the best of the youth," you will recognize how well drawn characters are in moments, as the story moves suddenly together. I really expect this to be distributed in the USA. I live in a sophisticated movie market, but we rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
