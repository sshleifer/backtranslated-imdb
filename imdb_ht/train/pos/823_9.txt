Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars legend, which finally ended in 2005, I was still watching this 1983 entry as my favorite movie in the long run run. The action scene varies with really different characters (Jabba Hut, furry furry creatures, etc.) did a particularly appealing movie. None of the action ever concentrated too long in one place, either. The last hour shows that the most as the scene changes every few minutes in the woods in the battle between the space ship of the laser-duel person between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Another nice feature of this movie was that the previous two had not been the absence of fighting between the two stars. Gone was the perpetuous brutality between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
