I do not think I could love reading more, though some things were disturbing. I will not say that, if you have not seen it ... you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can miss with Robert Downey Jr's puppy eyes? All-in-all, the draw was developed enough. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were like-able, and there were many hilarious scenes in it. The over-ally idea is that the story is very tight together, though certain aspects may be satisfactory ... not the problem of opinion. But, as I said before, it's hard not to like any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
