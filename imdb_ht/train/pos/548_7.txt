This film was just as good as some of the other westerns were made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester '73 and the Nude Spur, and Better Than Thunder Bay and Bend in the River. This film starts out as a run to the western mill, but becomes more complex as it goes along. It starts out with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle and Stewart packed with murder. He finds innocent but animals are robbed by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about getting her back. As the movie goes along, it's like Stewart just cares about herself just like her character throughout the Spur. It gets better at half-points after reaching Alaska. This is one of Stewart's best Westerns.
