While the premise of the movie is very lame (Ollie is diagnosed with "cuffo"), the film is a friendly and enjoyable little bit. It's also a bit darn better than the movie they've gone through to do after this one - probably since this was the latest Hal Roach-produced Laurel and Hardy movie. In fact, it would not be a bad idea to see any of the movie films, as the entire movie is lost in the movies and boys to play the parties purely for pathos - something true Laurel and Hardy movie would never do . They had a bit of a corner that all these films later missed. <br /> <br /> Stan and work Ollie in a cone factory. This sounds very funny, but it is not. No wonder with any surgery, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time to work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film and the team) recommends a sea trip. However, they do not like surfing and Stan has an idea of ​​just renting a boat tied to the pier - then they can get all the time the sea they want without all the trash! Once on the ship, a dangerous criminal escape frame the boat and they are all accidentally laid out to the sea. Fortunately, this portion of the movie was actually well-paced and the end many worked out very well. While not a full full length Laurel and Hardy film, it was better than many of them since it had no annoying numbers and distracted music (as in the DEVIL BROTHER or TAB in TOYLAND). In addition, there is always a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would see almost any of the following movie. The part of this was due to the boys' refusal to health (with the wide range Ollie) and part of it was due to the overall ineptness of these later films.
