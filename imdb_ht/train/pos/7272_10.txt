Before I start, let me tell you how GREAT this stand-up special sounds when you play Sonic My DX Adventure: Cutting Director at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So, while watching this stand-up special, I suggest - no, DEMAND you do it. Carlos Mencia took a stand-up in the extreme in San Francisco. There, it makes fun of everyone and absolutely NO exquisite. <br /> I'm pretty much thank God here that Carlos did not do his stuff in which he used the same joke over and over and over and over again. It does a great job that makes fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it; I know a couple of times I said, after Carlos said a joke, "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" Then the game on screen came on my TV because I forgot to play my adventure adventure DX: off the principal. I'm sorry :) So yeah, nothing to complain about this special stand-up. If you have TiVo or something like that, please make yourself a favor and record this historic hour.
