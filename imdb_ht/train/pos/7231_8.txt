The usual cats and antique mice are many until Jerry jumps into an invisible ink bottle. It gets the bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without him knowing. The cats become wise and try to do things they see 'jerry though it's not foolish-proof. Of course Jerry gets Butch aka Assassin aka spike the dog in the act (though he's late in the short, and his contribution is minimal indeed) Brilliant animated short of kind reminded me of the one with the white mouse scary Tom so badly. Most of the gag and violent work as any good Tom and Jerry short should really be. This hilarious cartoon can be found on one DVD disc in the Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Class: B +
