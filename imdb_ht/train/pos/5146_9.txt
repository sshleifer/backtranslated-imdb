As a man who was born in a German mother and father English (who spent five years in a prison camp in war) I came out of a unique position. One has to deal with the various Nazi on one side of the family and the victories of WW2 in the other. This miniseries can not be searched through every single part of the Hitler's psyche, and should give the viewer a general taste of the situation at the moment and as best as Hitler's idea of ​​the idea. In this series well. Carlyle is very good as O'Toole, but I would like to have more information on the relationship with others in part Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him who followed her in the letter often without questions and certainly without question later about in his murderous career. What happened in Goebbels, Goring and Hess's ideas? It would be helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people search the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not allow them to continue in power.
