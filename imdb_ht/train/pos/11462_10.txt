SPOILER ALERT! This film, zero day, provides an in-home experience for two students, Andrew and Calvin, who feels resentful and hated for anyone and anything related to the school. <br /> They go through a series of Self-Thinking out "Mission" all that leads up to the great mission, which is zero day. Zero days are not specified until the end of the movie. The viewer knows it's serious and full of hatred but never quite sure up to the end. <br /> Now we all know, if the movie is based on the Columbine massacre, the finish is prettier obvious. And the finish is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their fellow students at the end. <br /> I saw many movies about this attack, and this film by Far is my favorite, and most respected. It gives the viewer and inside look at the lives of two youth who have hate lives, and honestly gives the Viewer Some in an understanding, and a close on the horrible event. <br /> <br /> When you are only 7 when the events are played out, I never knew the gravity of shooting, until my English class has registered an essay or story about a definite time of our generation . Well I knew everyone was going to choose the twin towers, but I wanted to do different because of the twin towers were tragic and very definite, but I did not think it was right for me because there was really no way in related to that because, I was only in 3rd grade and I had no idea what it all meant. But shooting was left and effect. I remember the interviews, look at the sky at school, and the wounded and horror of the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a compelling, down-to-earth, and terrible musician, and I would recognize it in anybody.
