This was a pretty little American propaganda film that is both very creative and openly discussing the Nazi atrocities before all the limitations of the death camps were revealed. While late 1944 and 1945 would reveal just how bad and terrible they were, this movie, unlike other Hollywood films, is the most brutal film in honor of the era I've seen regarding Nazi atrocities. The movie begins in a courtroom in the future - after the war is over (the movie was made in 1944 - the war ended in May, 1945). In this global court, a Nazi leader tried to fight war. Wilhelm Grimm is totally repetitive and one by one witnesses call Grimm life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first, it appears that the movie becomes sympathetic or explains how Grimm has pushed to join the Nazi. However, after a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well-done and definitely keep your interest and also make the movie seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. All in the movie do a great job considering the movie mainly star second-tier actor. There are many compelling performances and performances - especially the very prehistoric scene towards the end that can not help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting how around the same point in the movie there were some super-creative scenes that used to cross in a way you could not notice first. In general, it is a must-see for story lovers and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This is not to say as a serious criticism of the movie, but Hitler was referred to as "paper hanger". This is a reference to myths that Hitler had once made to put up photos. This is in fact NOT true - before it would be a "starving star", homeless people and serving well in the German army at WWI. A terrible person, yes, but never a hanger paper!
