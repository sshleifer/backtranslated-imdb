What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? The "Soprano" has literally redefined TV as we know it. He broke all the rules and put new standards for television excellence. Everything is impeccable, written, directed, and for me, most of all, the act. Watching this show you will find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. Acting your tricks in thinking has a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show because it's violent, not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and much more deeply than everything depends on you, as a fan sees. For me, I do not like when referring to the show, a show on the Mafia. For me, it is a family show. A family that, through generations, came to be separated from the crowd. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what TV should be. Right here. Complex characters come out of stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you find when mixing these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and ozs must be different.
