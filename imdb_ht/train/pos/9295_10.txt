It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments regarding this all-star flick. I laughed at the whole picture, as did all my family. The film clearly defines itself as an old Gangster Gangster - players have hysteria - I'll bet they had a good old time while doing it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and how about these Everly sisters, each of the two Falco, and the divine music at all. Rob Reiner has made a great street driver Limo, and Gabriel Byrne has a neurotic rhythm. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortar and the author's gravel references. Paul Anka was his usual fun, and the added attraction to run awful after Byrne decided to make a Duet of "My Way" welcomed home to performance Vick. <br /> I am of the opinion that this movie was a funny comic book of Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitates him well. I am also in the opinion that no one, at any age, would think even in imitation of action taken in this film - it's a joke - not a film "gangsta" movie. Cars and clothes were impressive, as was the decorative, "The Vic Vic." Truly, I think of the "angry dog ​​time" as a music comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime crimes, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for an evening of family fun.
