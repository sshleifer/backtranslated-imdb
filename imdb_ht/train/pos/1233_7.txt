A strange role for Eddie Murphy is taken at the height of his career. While there is a lot of "Eddie Murphy's character," he plays a really decent person. The rest cast is a good, particularly beautiful Lewis Charlotte. His character's beauty and tranquility kept the tone in the movie from getting to be too much Murphy.
