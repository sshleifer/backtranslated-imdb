When I heard that this movie came out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book, written in 1978, I read it before you saw the movie. I'm sure the movie would be very different with me if I did not read the book. The writers actually did a great job of staying true to the main scheme of the book, and minor differences, of course. I think the thing that shame me more about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col. I'm not a big Boyle fan, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the film, she's always trying to use it on -pulse mouth, and dark-eyed-eyed face looks super sexy. Indeed, I think the movie has been held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. My favorite overburden was the Sheehan family (which is so weird b / c was the son of Iraq killed and current events have Casey Sheehan whose mother went to a great anti-Iraq tirade). In the book, obviously the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house turned on that video of the son of the helicopter, I was really shining out. In general, I was impressed with the movie, in which she followed the book very well.
