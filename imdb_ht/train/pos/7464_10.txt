Has made me think about it for days after seeing it. That I'm the mark of a big movie. Eyes Wide closed had the same effect on me. I'm tired of those who are asking these happy Hollywood cookies-knife sequels. I plan on going to see it again tonight understanding the plot a little better - but regardless, the emotional messages in the movie have been totally felt.
