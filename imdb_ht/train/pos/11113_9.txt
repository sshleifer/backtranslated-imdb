I've only watched the first series on DVD but would resume Sopranos as a Shakespearean scheme and a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and casinos, and almost as good as Godfather's (hence a "10"), and far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there's lots of action, some of it's pretty bloody, the story is driving characters. Even some of the minor characters contributed to great story lines; e.g. the priestly relationship (or lack of) and Carmilla and the restorative wife, and Christopher and her friends (who did not last long (an award winner Darwin?)) <br /> <br /> Apart from the draw, the script and act, the other reason I liked it; <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey with pasta foods and a tomato sauce. 2. The music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
