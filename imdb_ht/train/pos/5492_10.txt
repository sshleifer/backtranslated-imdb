I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for a moment now, but it was not until I saw the movie in Amsterdam documentary of the international film festival that I realized what he really achieved. This film tells about Venezuela's elite / plagiarism, oil and oil companies that love Western government's corruption, the presidential Chavez presidential withdrawal, and Venezuela returning to a brutal dictatorship. This movie must be for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson in the rest of the world! I commend Venezuela's people to take part in their own hands and save their country in love with Halliburton and the Bush regime.
