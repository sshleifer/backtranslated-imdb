When I was a kid, I totally liked both Bill & Ted Movies. That night, Bogus Travel was over and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it, I decided to tune in and I love it all again! This movie is still funny after all these years. 'Excellent Adventure' is better, but one this stone just the same. Sure, some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is cheesy in a cool way. Plus it features the coolest character of death ever in a movie! Conclusion: totally like non-movie dudes! Way Excellent! STATION !!!
