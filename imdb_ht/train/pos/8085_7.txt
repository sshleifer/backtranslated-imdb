One thing I can say about this movie is quite long, VERY LONG! I actually recently bought this movie a couple of months ago to see that there was a new version coming out. I was happy to find that he did in 1978 because the 70 (though I never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for the music! when I watched this movie the story was actually very good at the beginning, but then after about 50 min it started getting pretty boring and repetitive. I'll admit the animation made to impress me! It was nothing I had ever seen before and was pretty cool to see. but the movie honestly could have been a bit better, it could have been much more talked to her story than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just tore battles. Then for 5 or 10 minutes the film was collected and got good again, but ended unexpectedly. In my opinion I thought it was incredibly long. I know its 13 minutes more than 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it seem like it was 4 hours time !!!! but in general it is an okay movie I guess and I'll watch it again on one of those "nothing to do day". I'll see the new one and I hope it is better!
