The Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B-movies that BBC2 screened on Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also Stay at Night with Brighton Strangler. In this one, a man walking his dog in Central Park comes across an abandoned car and discovering a woman who died inside. He was shot and police then tried to identify him with only a mark as the main sign. After identifying, the murderer was discovered and fired at the shootout at the end. Most of this film was shot aside in and around New York, so we get to see some areas in the city we do not normally see, especially the streets back. <br /> <br /> Mostly the unknowns at the cast, and John Miles will receive the bill. <br /> <br /> The Tattooed Stranger is looking out. Excellent, but rather dark. <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
