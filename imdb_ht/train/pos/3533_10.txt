Unfortunately not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuit on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes that his boss was wrongly accused of murder, and courage took on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with twists and many gone and dark, none of which I'll mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being in very low budget and being done during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks like a mountain - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew a lot about these matters, filing the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - in their era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who emigrated to Hollywood, and brought a very original cool vision to them. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never gave a bigger part yet, and finally ended in the western productions.
