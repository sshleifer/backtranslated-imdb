The boys are working out a recording studio when they hear "an angel's voice." That would be Miss Van Doren, audition and going under the name of Miss Andrews because his father did not approve of being a "singer radio". However, he expects a certain great-wig, Mrs. Bixby, a friend of his father will hire him, and then he'll have to give his approval. It leaves but the minute boys are running Amok in the studio causing havoc and other makers from the killers after breaking the recording session. Finally things are soothing. "We're eluding," said Moe. "Yeah, we got away, too," replied Curly. <br /> <br /> The boys then fool around the studio, put on Miss Van Doren's record and curly gets dressed in women's clothing and pretend to sing. Ms. Bixby walks, impressed with staff "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For a supplementary $ 500, he asked to come up with big songs from the party later this evening. The rest, as they say, is the story of Curly to pretend to be an opera singer and some funny outcomes. Oh, by the way, it was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto." What happens in the party is simply that the truth wins out, but not before an antique slapstick takes place. In all, a very good episode. I loved it but would not miss it as anything special.
