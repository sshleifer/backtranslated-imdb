"To: the warriors from magic mountains" and is an impressive classic! You could never guess she was born in 1983. Tsui Hark uses special effects were very creative and inventive. (He continued to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later production.) Even now he can measure up to other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "mighty" zombies from magical mountains! It is not necessary to see this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is somewhat hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn 'I was still wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hand on CGI Now we know he made this movie .. Maybe it sometimes is too much, but the result The overall is so wonderful that I will not be critical of that .. There are so many things on the screen, you simply will not believe! I think it's a great shame that this movie has not been shown in theaters here in Holland The film is screaming for screen times in movies! This film is unlikely to hit big Hollywood budget output like "Returns to the End" or Xmen 3. The only thing I must mention is the lack of humor! In most Tsui Harks movies it combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor .. Somehow he is missing from this movie again. I'm not going to be picky abo for the little affairs. "The Zuaga Legend" delivers on the action front and the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic!
