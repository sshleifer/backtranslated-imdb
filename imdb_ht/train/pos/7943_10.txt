I love this TV series very much. It has interesting and beautiful animation. I do not believe it to cut it on TV, and also that I never get to know if cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently to survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix has far better TV shows ever. I know it's late to expect they will start the series over again so I'm really happy I got to watch it. I love it so much <3 <its <br /> <br /> it's about a woman by the name of cybersix, it is not human. She goes by adrian sieldman, a teacher at a high school. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, it is just disguised as a man of the day. At night the cybersix patrol the city. <br /> A guy by the name of Richter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds it is alive he uses everything he can take him. <Br /> <br /> IF you never watch it before you should totally download it. He has shown the best TV in the world. Why was it cut to ???? Some people have problems. but I'm glad I got to watch 13 episodes.
