The Airwolf Movie, A variation on the original two pilot party, but the movie although shorter, includes extra Unseen footage of pilots in the Pilot hours is the most a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot movie is virtually the same The thing (2 stacks combined) but the movie is actually a different edit and extras here and the cut. <br /> <br /> Worth a look, though you have the season 1 DVD series, I would still pick up a copy of the "movie" It's still in some shops like Maiden, Woolworths and Love in mixed media stores, although It generally needs to be ordered, but it's saved which needs to be purchased online (as many of us still do not trust or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf really 1 of the 80 most under the show shows. A full-size Airwolf size is now being re-built for a Helicopter Museum:) Info and work in photo progress on http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Games Sim Simi It's Finally It's Yours stay :)
