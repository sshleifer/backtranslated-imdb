Notice that all those who do not like and enjoy this film claim that it was not as good as the book or that it differs from the book. <br /> I do not understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, film has about 120 minutes. But the movie has the advantage of many interesting meanings: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. I do not care if a movie is as good or, in fact, there is any resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it is. <br /> This movie movie was good. An old and often-viewed story, which tends to cliche, it could easily have been embarrassing. However, Reiffen and Reeves pull it off. A review has been found far away in old age. I would never have guessed it was 40 when she made this movie. She is her creditor as an actress that she plays a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I also think he is on the best things ever made. The story could be strong, and I agree that the screen game could be used "tightening." However, it is well worth the look; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather a good romance that will let you satisfy that love is a strong emotion and good win the wrong fight. And it is nice to see a "love story" without mandatory f # $ words, buttocks are naked, or hours of spit-exchanging kissing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music score is excellent.
