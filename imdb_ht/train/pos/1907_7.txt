8 Simple rules are a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially a mature lesson about moving on after a lost episode where Paul died that was the first episode I ever looked at in the show coming on ABC . Hennessy Tribe - Mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughter of Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and son of Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look at each other for guidance and support after Paul's death (John Ritter) patriarch of the family. Parent Cate (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I'm glad later in the 2nd quarter of this show they decided to put David Spade in this show since he did with the NBC series, just shoot me! But all and all this show is very good. This show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's to the 90's who used to be on ABC.
