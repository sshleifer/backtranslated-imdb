This show was a landmark in American comedy as it was the first star of a whole African-American cast. Unfortunately though it has never been largely discarded on the British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans Family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. The father called James, he is trying to run home, but his wife Florida always gets the best of her. Three children are JJ artistic, Thelma Moody and Michael's intellectual teenager. Always coming to home is Florida's gossip friend Willona. <br /> I watch two episodes of this show on youtube (Black and Jesus and Sex and the Evans family - the only one on the site). You can think why an English viewer looks at a series that has never been shown or hardly heard in his hometown. The answer is this. In 1976, Britains first all black cats came out called "The Forces" Only the two sets were made and he now looks forgotten. But I watched an episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters but with different names- Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl Tripotip's friend was Vilma. (To read about the Forces I wrote a review about it). Also watching "Good Times" only two things annoy me. The first was to mix the term theme (terrible) and secondly laughed at the audience. I love laughing audience, but in this one would say a little bit funny and the audience would go mad and start applauding. Apart from that it was a very funny show. Let's hope that more episodes turn on youtube and allow the hope that someone will release "encourage" them on DVD in England. <br /> Best Episode: Sex and Family Evans - Series 1 Episode 6. The Foster Episode of It's called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, Black Jesus was a title of one episode of "encouraging"
