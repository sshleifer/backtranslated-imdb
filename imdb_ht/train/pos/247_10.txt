I love this movie, because it shows that they did not kill for fun, but to save them they liked! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job describing Ned and Joe. It has some quick quick snapshots but it's all right other than that. The language is very serious and sometimes does not even know it is there. This movie shows that just because they are banished by means of greedy assassins! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important times in such stories as this one. There is only one thing to captivate me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their weapons from a Ned book look! Also, this is how people remember, from the guns. I hope people watch this movie and get interested as I have.
