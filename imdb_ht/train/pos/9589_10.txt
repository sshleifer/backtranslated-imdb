Growing in NYC at the late 80's / late 90's stage fence, I can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries being made in that cover of this time period. No Madonna did not come up with the idea of ​​Voguing but this is where he got it in! Instead of gaining violence on each other or bitchy chat battles, voguing allows people to "fight" to the limit of everything short of touching each other (which would guarantee an automatic disqualification). See these extraordinary talent / well-organized orchestrates "cast-downs" in the clubs were nothing short of spectacular and all the great names from back to the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Diprée, Farmer , etc ... all commemorate in love of piece periods like Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... it did not matter who you were, or where you came from because when you walked across These doors in this "magic kingdom" of type, you have become part of something larger than yourself / you were important / and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination ... with anybody out in any place might become king (or queen) as the case could. Words and withers were just as sharp as the movements on the floor. All of the tensions, excitement, and magic of NYC's many urban environments have been captured in this film. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE relay on DVD for the world to see !!! Thanks!
