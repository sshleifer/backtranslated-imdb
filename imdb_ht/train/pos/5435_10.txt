I saw this picture in 1940 for $ .11 and I would like to put a DVD in 2006 The movie was the biggest adventure of the time, and, like all ages, it is still a fun wonder (B & W and all) You get a sense of real friendship links in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe & Eduardo Cianelli are exceptional (This could not happen today I particularly liked the finish where the Colonel recited the poet's end Kipling on the body of Gunga Din and says "Untouchable" "You Are A Better Than My Gunga Din" They do not make movies of this character today. The only cast that still alive today is Joan Fontaine
