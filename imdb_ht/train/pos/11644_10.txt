Show this is awesome! I've been a fan since it premiered, and it only keeps me watching ... I've seen some awful things here, that I wish I did not, but it really shows you how addiction affects all involved, not just addicted. You can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol in the addictive shopping, or eating addictive disease. And actually, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come in too. We've seen accomplished musicians, an NBA player, and even young people, who really need the help. And since they began to show a few follow-ups, this was frightening too. Now you can see how they are a while while after they are revealed. If you do not check this one out, please do. It's about A & E, and it's awesome! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST, if I remember correctly ... so put your TiVo!
