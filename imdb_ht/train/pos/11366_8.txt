A superb and compelling drama on the hunt for the notorious Russian assassin Andrea Chikatilo. The great performance of Stephen Rea as the legal scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle in his progress is the Russian government, in particular members of the old communist party who want to keep a close society. /> The film has a hidden theme on the decline of communist societies, and the progress of the hunt for the assassin is reflected by the progress of social and political change in Russia, which is subtly placed across. There is a controversy in old and new ways, and these are represented by the opinions of the superior Rea (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are first polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in downward systems, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause ?? to catch the serial killer. <br /> In all films the relationship between these two develops, with the tension gradually facilitated until the end of the film Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have respect for each other, the killer is caught, and symbolic Glasnost comes . Excellent script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Psychologists risking his reputation to help.
