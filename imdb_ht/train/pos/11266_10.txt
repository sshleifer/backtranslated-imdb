I recently looked at this, but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about, what the subject was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary, was a comedy routine ..... Well, it was one. <br /> It started a little slow, but I think it was because I was absolutely no idea what kind of program I watched. But he quickly sucked me into the episode I watched Robert Wuhl was discussing about reality and fiction in history. Especially as we (the Americans) learn stories that are not really true - and how we got to learn what we did. He did this in a way that keeps the viewer completely entertained, and interested. I actually learned a few things and is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> I would like to see this gather as a set for HBO. I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of subjects - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
