Hamlet is by far my favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one heck of an actor. His painting of this was just amazing. His soliloquies were enchanting. For as long as it was she is scarce for a movie to keep my interest, however I was pushing this piece in particular. I recommend this to anyone of both fans of Shakespeare and those who are not so much. This has everything the modern world looks for in its movie: murder, betrayal, and falsehood. Do not hit the Mel Gibson version, but Branaughs touches the whole job. This leaves no rock unturned. When you finish the movie it will feel as if it's playing in your mind. Why do you say "two thumbs"?
