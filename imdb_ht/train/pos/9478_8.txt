This is a nice little movie and a beautiful story, which plays the most important role of the whole movie. It is a very intriguing dramatic story, and also romance present in it. The story is said slowly but this works out all too well for its build. Characters are beautiful and portray nicely by its actors. Normally I'm not a big fan of the style acting Asian but acting in this movie was merely good. Of course the film is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. In one way this film is more advanced with its approach than the western cinema made during the same era. <br /> I only wanted the movie its visual style was a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art-film movie this house is certainly missing in some good looking sequences. This was obviously a cheap movie making and it did well generically. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevents this movie from really distinguishing itself and raising itself above the genre. <br /> But well, this movie is all about its well-constructed history and the characters in it. In this regard this movie certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
