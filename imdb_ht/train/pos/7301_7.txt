When I heard about "Hammerhead" being released on DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another movie monster movie from Nu Image". Those gentlemen around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produce cheap but very fun B - Pictures in the past few months, but also some pretty disappointing movies. So I did not expect much, especially after looking rather irritating "Shark Zone" just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" has become an excellent revival of the 1950s movie monster. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the animal, a huge mix of mutants between a man and a hammer shark. All you need for a fun monster movie. The only thing missing is the sex scene scene with stripping that you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie has been made for its television to understand why these scenes are gone. And it does not matter whatever the reason "Hammerhead" is the horrors of entertainment and entertainment at its best. There are two reasons I gave it seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster can not see very often with the confrontation and destruction of the beast too fast and harm done, and secondly, William Forsythe just not the right guy for the party "hero" and so fall in love with gorgeous Tylo showers. Other than that, I can highly recommend this movie to any outdoor monster fans. Grab yourself a cool drink with some popcorn, watch this movie and enjoy. Jasper P. Morgan
