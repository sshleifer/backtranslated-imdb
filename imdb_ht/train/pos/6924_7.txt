This intricate western one was an important step in career in STEWART PLAYER after returning to war service, wanting to change his image by making a west, which is widely regarded as the reason for the western mob of the '50s since it's very impressive. Too it did not picture in Technicolor. Stewart won the first prize for "the gun that won the West", but then spent the rest of the movie trying to recover when he was stolen. SHELLEY Winter is a shady breeze with a reckless reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the weapon gun boy local in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad companion. And you would not know that, it was a Universal Film-International, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both well-known at the time) have a bit of rhythm. <br /> <br /> An exciting sequence features the first Indian attack, where CHARLES Drake reveals itself to be a loose riding, leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn wagon. He later smashes his head, but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passed from one hand to another - but finally ends with the legitimate owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY AND STEWART GAMES has quite a final shooting that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as DUEL in the final blazing gun SUN. McNally makes the villain perfect with DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the role of the villainous he played throughout the '40s as a low-life gunslinger. <br /> <br /> Well-built story is well-directed by Anthony Mann, and it is fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credible as Young Bull) wearing American war paintings and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who wants to see the glow Then thin and attractive to Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing and definitely a higher than average.
