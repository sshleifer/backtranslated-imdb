This is a trio of "Shakti", "Devi", and "Kali", on an experimental community (or some things) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, who took people on tour inside and out of the the unknown domain, and left a bit of damage here and there, I'd say. Many years later some of this damage still caches and awaits the right moment to show himself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man who could not exist. Apparently this woman is able to project some interior demons, or so get the sister of the man who killed when she tries to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump from his skin". It's a scratch, a freak speed, and sent to see a fair psychiatrist who happens to be a senior member of this community, which results in the good doctor helping the young man achieve his desire. This is probably the best of three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer, who tried to "cure" this woman who was part of this community and allowed to release some kind of evil spirits who lived in this woman, but it's only one wonder if she did read or release it because it can not survive it anymore. All three of these accounts are beautiful creepy and thrilling because you never really make sure you expect, and the quotes and settings are so unlike that conventional film movie that it adds to the weird. This has a sort of low-budget look and feel but it also manages to conjure up a beautiful atmosphere to climb to all, many of its credit. I watch this and my mouth hangs open a good portion of the time and time the real crises (and gore) happen to hit very hard. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and love it very much. A good little find, this one, I would give it 8 out of 10.
