For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever been.Omize racism, life struggles and prove itself is not just an ordinary "cookie", Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play, who puts it Cuba at her best light, the best performance in her life.One Niro, who is a living legend giving what sommeting to the movie.Hati her character in film, but it gives so good acting this movie, great performance.And the beautiful appearance Charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie. So, if you have not seen this movie I highly recommend those who love the courage, greatness of inspiration.You must watch this great drama. Vote 9/10.
