"Girlfight" is the most a coming-of-age-story than it is a flick of battles. And what a relief has to be one in a city school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinist and credible use of the Brooklyn project environment. <br /> It made me realize that virtually every Hollywood high school cinema is set in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even a bit comparable to "Love and Basketball" focusing on young African Americans placed in suburbia.) While these children share some of the same peer problems, these problems shrunk compared to the struggles of other children , where high school graduation might be the greatest achievement in life. <br /> <br /> The feminist component here is fixed in its originality, as you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - with a victory - on its theme. A lot of audience sympathy goes to the guy who challenged to rise in a sex-bending-expectant situation. The film drags a bit here and there, but this is no cheap emotional "Rocky" movie fight, as the practices and battles have complex results, and all their relationships - Especially with dad and father face - take more scent than the earring center. They had lots of interesting music credits listed in the end, but I did not really notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written 10/7/2000)
