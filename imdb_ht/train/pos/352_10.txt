I just saw "Valentine" and I must say it was the best slasher movie that I've seen in those years. Unlike the recent trend in the 90's horror flicker, this film is more concerned with being weird than it is and being self-scared. For those who hate "Call," there is not one reference to the "horror rules" of this movie (though the old slasher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect mix of the 80's and the 90's horror. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of the movie 90's and the slogan-slasher folly in repeating a 80's. I guess the year 2001 that will eventually give the horror fans the kind of movies they were looking for. This is definitely a movement in the right direction. <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a funny character. You can say she liked her role and made it stand out. I liked it in this movie.
