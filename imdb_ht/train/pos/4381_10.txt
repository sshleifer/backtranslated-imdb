This sweat drama has everything: head acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historic Scotland. Though I love Braveheart, I think this is the best of these two films. Jessica Lange has given an incredible performance (would have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the worst, jerk, characters in movie history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character. I'm always amazed at the incredible series of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his family, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a person who makes himself, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And this is basically what this story is all about; honors of the common man against corruption in the nobility. This movie is very fun, it should appeal to everyone. She has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and she has an interesting plot. One of my favorite films.
