Many Americans could say ... What is ??? in opening comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is undoubtedly a curse for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comments are good. We have the peasant who goes to the city to seek help against a cricket that wants to steal the crop in the village. The big difference is the way the story takes. Our samurai, a number of circus performers as in the original is a very complex mix of personality but at the end are what the village needs, Heroes. Please watch this incredible movie (seven samurai, obviously) and find another movie that stole the story and tried to find the same magic effect than the prince of Akira Kurosawa. One tip is the 13 Warrior and Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copying the story to his best seller, but he did not get the third footage of the cat.
