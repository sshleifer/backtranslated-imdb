I liked the episode but seems to me there are some quick references to the secretary getting punished so effectively being an accomplice after the fact. While I love when an episode of Columbo has a unpredictable twist such as this one, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the discovery of the murderer. The interval between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by famous Lt. The Columbo, making a long-in-the-lifetime real-life life-renowned detective as a crime-solved. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.
