I liked watching 'Hunt Hunting' back in the day I was in grammar school and would be doing home to do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch 'Hunt Hunting' with Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. I loved it! It took you somewhere not very accessible at that time, under the big blue sea. Preference to Thunderball or even before Cousteau was common, Mike Nelson captured children's imagination .I would like to wager that more than a few kids develop their passion for oceanography or biology or one of their studies in watching this show Photographic photography also progresses, the passion for exploration is easy to encourage until watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
