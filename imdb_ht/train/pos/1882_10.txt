<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. It is a throwback to the glitsy, sterling romantic comedy in the 1940s but with a modern touch. The burst of wit and wit, charm, humor and tenderness, the symphony is breathtaking (NYC never looked so beautiful), and the neck has the throw! Dudley Moore turns to performance in his career as a favorite, drunken Arthur Bach. It is also wistful and real..one in the best film line is her poignant "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we're not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won an Oscar greatly deserved for his splendid performance as Hobson, Arthur's Valet and Caring. Even if he considers it a "take the money and run roles", he brings to the character all the experience talented, and bravura of a tragidian expert and a sly comedy. Thrust in support is also out of this World, from Sassy Bach to Geraldine Fitzgerald in Stephen Elliott's Mafioso Bomb. <br /> <br /> The note is also very memorable and congratulating the film perfectly. Instead of real problem with the movie is the end of his end spawned.
