A case for being in the right place at the right time. What is a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He finds things to do. It is accessible. And it is also easy to see why in the West hated it very much. He has control over the resources of his country, giving the profits back to the people. Mostly the poor. And it's easy to see how the TV stations can show the false image of the case. Just like Iraq's war, or the war on terror. Or those who miss the WMD. Or how about the wrong axis. People need to wake up. And find different points of view. Stop neo in focusing the world. Go to this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind up. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom of Fascism. Not in America is the problem. Is the government.
