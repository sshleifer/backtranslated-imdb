An entertaining and solid, non-stop movie was designed to compare comparison with "Run Lola Run". The movie rapidly develops in a chasing sequence, during which viewers learn about the three main characters of flashbacks and drug sequences. The chase serves not as a fast-paced range, but as a tour that makes up the majority of the movie. During the "run" we see the characters grow and forget about their sad life, about the "macho" roles they've bought, and eventually forget about why they started running in the first place. Many like fighting give a "clarity" for the characters of "Fight Club," running to this movie character and a step away from the fake values ​​that we all allow the society to create for us. Runs to serve as a truly tasty way of life in an unclouded perspective, and all three find some levels of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and pleasure only shake a little at the end of the movie, where instead of learning through their experiences, the characters seem to return to act out those malicious roles I thought they were escaping from the travels. <br /> <br /> Still, the only true issue and this movie is that it has not been distributed outside Japan earlier.
