I never really watched this program before although it was highly recommended by my family members. Funnily enough, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (location of manure) and has attracted a few landmarks when I first visited. <br /> This got my interest going so I bought the 1 series on video and sat down watching. Besides recognizing some of the places, I found myself not in the little bit of wonder. Again the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the world's finest comedy. TLOG properly arranged the stand with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Ase says I'm tuned to the program now. Characters are superb and show weird depth while maintaining a realistic edge. Look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes weak feel of the North (no respect for Hadfield that I found a very welcoming and warm place). <br /> I only hope it continues its originality throughout its run (based on the 2nd series that concludes its reunion in UK last night, it certainly is).
