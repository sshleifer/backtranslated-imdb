I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought this was going to be just another movie and a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined boxing because she wanted to. I thought this film was good. I gave it a 8/10. That's how good it is. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even he was in only six.
