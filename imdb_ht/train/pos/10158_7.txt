Johnny and June Casharies funded this movie which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real sense of what the world of Jesus seemed like (I was there), and June joining the party in Mary Magdala with a passion. Cash settlement is also good. But <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was wrong. 2. There is no corner of the story like Cash put into some of its trust-based music. 3. Because it is incomprehensible, I doubt we will see this ever widely distributed again. <br /> I would like to buy the CD. Tom Paine Texas, USA
