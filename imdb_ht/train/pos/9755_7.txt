The last time I saw the movie I was about seven years, so my opinion might be jaded over time. At the time I enjoyed the movie that changed between the cartoon and live action. At that moment I felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life. Also I felt glee when after the Captain Captain kidnapped the heroine (a princess or keeper of the game) the tables turned on him. Unfortunately the producers have never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have twenty year old memories. I'm sure if I've seen the movie again I would consider it corny and sappy, but I really enjoyed it movie at the moment.
