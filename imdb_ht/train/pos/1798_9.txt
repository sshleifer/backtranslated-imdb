Visited this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it is a stick-to-your-bone film - it really lived with me. Adapting very smartly to what is probably an excellent novel, it's a dram-back-and-forth-in-time with character full of rounds, thoughtfulness about life choices, and, I'm not overwhelmed. One of the biggest projects ever assembled in 100 + years of film-making. Beautiful work of everyone, led by a Vanessa Redgrave neon as a dead, deluded Newport Matron, and Claire Danes as her lesser self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer is, like Mama, the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman about 1958 and does not overplay the charm; and what a pleasure to see actors such as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contribute sharp, bustling state. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not bring many corners into the role of a little clich√© in a happy happy rally, and family problems can be resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. But it's a rhythm, visually gorgeous meditation on real-life issues, and you can cry in it and not feel like you're being impressively manipulated. Also, what is a rich parade of automotive 1940s / 50s.
