When I heard Patrick Swayze finally returned to his acting career with KING SOLOMON'S MINES I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana adventure type adventure adventure. What I got was a 4-hour (and ad) season that was very slow. The second and third hours could collapse altogether and the story would not suffer for it. The finish was good (no hit here) but I still left wanting more. Well all a guy can do is the Hawks that Swayze performs "RoadHouse 2" so he can get back to the genre of action that made him famous. Unless you are a fan of King Solomon's masterpiece than reading the book or looking version in 1985 with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone who is also not very good but only her and hours and forty minutes in your life go instead of 4 hours.
