Increasing Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to see. It was very hearty to feel and there was a lot of humor that gets you sucking right in. It's so much like real life and what the youth have to go through. Victor, a teen cocky, but with a good heart at the end of the deals and love at everywhere they are right to deal with girls and their families. At the end Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old fashioned grandmother and a girl who she wants to use is actually using her too. I recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like watching a real family. That's how much this film has. A heart felt the moment when Victor's grandmother launched a victory over something simple. Victor was really hearty and he could not believe he would do something like that. She made me feel sorry for her as she was real. Overall I give this movie a B +
