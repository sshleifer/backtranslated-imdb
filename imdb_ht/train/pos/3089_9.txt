I was hooked on this as apparently ABC has this license to show Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It keeps my surprise, as it was a break from China's cost. But I started getting the leak, as the cast and story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Nothing is too incredible, though I think it's very pretty stereotyping to write Damien as a black man with a leaf !!!! This was the most irritating aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad about learning about IMDb that I can not look forward to watching season 2 when I get back to the US. I'm just as disappointed as the other commentators that this has shown many promises with quality and taste. But as show that character show is getting closer, it's probably more difficult for people to look at if the start will look at several in. Bumps. That's apparently a bit too late for their eagerness networks.
