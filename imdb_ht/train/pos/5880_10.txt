On the contrary to those listed above I felt that this film was really funny particularly in the scenes of having a lot of mixing them. I do not want to give the plot and the storyline go to the people who have not watched it again, but I'll say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role as past Priyadarshan movies, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal makes an amazing part of the little role given to him, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar has proved that he is no less in this film than he was from Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Even though all three heroin of this movie was at first they did a very good job of acting particularly Nargis that is very good looking and hot. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must look.
