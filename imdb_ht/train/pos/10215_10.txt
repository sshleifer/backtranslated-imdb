Most people pursuing movies featuring Audrey Tautou does not seem to understand that Amelie was a character - it's not true Audrey Tautou's personal life, hence every movie she participates in will not make Amelie Part 2, Part 3, etc. <br /> Now and that said, I even collected this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there's a huge space after the first scene where it's not all seen for 45 min, but I do not even miss it because I've had lots of fun with the other characters. The guy who lies on everything is too funny, the guy who justifies who runs out of his cafe and jumps out on the bill does not get coupons to that balance out the loss, actually .... getting Of all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou's character Irene is not the little sugary girl that Amelie was. In fact, as Irene, his rudeness in a boom requires change to keep me in the first guard. In this film, Irene is a good-looking girl, but over the course of a (very terrible) day, her disposition becomes more and more back and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, and all characters can actually act. The best part of the film comes with about 20 minutes left ... this is when all of the cemetery starts to mesh and the ride really picks up with all link links together with make sense, and all butterfly effect the flowers. I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of the movie I saw in well for a while, and ended .... It made me think "my damn really lucked out to get this movie". Finishing this movie is toothpaste. Anyone who writes the script for this is brilliant, because not only has all these other subplots going on, but they somehow make them all tied together (and in a sensitive manner, which is the case here ), but also makes each character feel human and come alive, not just some stingy characters used as a cook to build this whole butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> I highly suggest this movie as it's a great movie to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.
