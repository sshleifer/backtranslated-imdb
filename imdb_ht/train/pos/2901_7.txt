Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly in the film action genre film, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, rapid rapport between its drive, and exceptional photography. The Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein, a delayed assault on the rise of Diaz (Luis Luque) detective, was assigned to investigate the murder of two minor minorities who seem to have participated in arms smuggling. Diaz has been suspended from assignments, but he is the best person for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be restored. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a plot involving Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separated them into a critical point that allowed Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of its own. Peretti and Luque are excellent and remind me of team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti is not as beautiful as Hill. Considerably, even in nearly two hours at Tiempo de Valientes by its welcoming, and true writer-director Damian Szifron sets up a potential end to the good film COD. All in all, a wonderful and very funny comedy action that neither panders in the lower denominator is common or insulting your intelligence.
