I must admit that the Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple rain has not only broken boundaries, it puts a decade, costumes, music, the behavior, and the dance! Today, my friends and I always jam in the purple band and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution. <br /> Now the movie itself, I just meant what I was saying in the title, because for most parts, this movie itself was made by the music. Act Please do not let me judge that since this is one of my favorite pleasures guilty, because I know that it's not Oscar deserved by any means. But I think the duo taken this movie was Morris and Jarome, their speeches about password were just beyond hilarious. I just want to rate this movie about the sequence of concerts because I felt it was what made the movie. <br /> <br /> Prince is a music genius and creating beautiful music. While the movie and acting are very bad, this movie is always a pleasure to watch at night and even dance. This film defines the 80, so just have fun with it. Prince would like it so just to party down! Oh, boy, who sounds lame. <br /> 9/10
