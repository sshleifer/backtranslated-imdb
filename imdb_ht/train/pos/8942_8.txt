A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. He was 25 and he was 50 when this film was released. I think the difference did not matter for a suspension drama like Vertigo, but it has problems for a romantic comedy. We can clearly understand, that's why his character should be attracted to her, but it's less clear why she should be attracted to her. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie works as a romantic fantasy light. The scene where he stares at him around the head of the cat, and his darkness painted-on flaring and the sounds of his dog and the cat pushing, is true magic. It is a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building, and we see the age difference very stringent. As she embraced her, she came to run in her fingers in her hair, but stopped movement and just brush her right lightly against her tune.
