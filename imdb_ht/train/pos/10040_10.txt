For me personally this movie went down to my top four ever. No exception. James Cameron has proven himself time and time again that he is a master manufacturer. Through films like aliens, the abyss and both Terminators it is clear that it was a brilliant and confident director as far as action and science fiction went. She sees a story and adds an unusual quality to the movie. But Titanic is so much different with his other course of shine. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, development draws and exciting character development in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her virgin journey is legendary so the challenge was for Cameron to make a movie, interesting and fun movie about it. The act is wonderful like Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstar overnight and the release of this movie and in most my films get annoyed when the characters support they do not give much to do, but in this movie It is more objective because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story quickly apparent that she is the Rose and Jack's story alone, no one else. It is emotionally entirely satisfying and can leave no eye in a theater or home. The music has become icons and legends. It is James Horner's best band composer ever and many recalls in the film and the audience. The song has long been harassed but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this movie is. Only one issue, James Cameron's problematic problem, is the dialogue that is memorable but in a bad way as to how his cheesy is at the point but all that is aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece with a romantic season that sweeps you on a journey of life. My heart will not come out of this one.
