The National Gallery of Art has shown long-thought to lose the original version version of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes off by gender on its release. Character of the Brush, a moral tough-individual person in the original Sentinel release in 1933 here presented as a follower of the Nietsze philosopher and encouraged him to use the claws of his way to the top. Also, the fantastic ending of the original I assume is in the actual VHS version eliminated and finished to restore in its original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and power. Hopefully, there will be a review of this movie on DVD for everyone to appreciate its great variety. Look for it.
