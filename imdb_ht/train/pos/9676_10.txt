The film was very sweet and heartwarming! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie to everybody. The movie was so inspiring for me. The actors did a great job of acting, and the movie was very well played and done. The film was about a girl who owns a parrot by calling Paulie. Paulie was separated by her parents because they thought it would be best for her. After Paulie experienced many people he ended up in a cage in his head in a basement. Finally the Russian man who had a job at a place like a janitor. Paulie was found in the basement and Paulie began to speak and told him the story of his life. At the end of this man helped Paulie meet with Marie (the girl who raised Paulie). Love to beat all the obstacles.
