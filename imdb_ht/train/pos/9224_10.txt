This movie is visually stunning. Who cares if she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. These sites, series designs, and costume functions perfectly transmit what was found in a love story including beauty, genealogy and wealth. In some ways I would like to see this movie as a tribute to John and the story of Bo Derek. And ... this word should not be completed without mentioning Anthony Quinn's role as father, counselor, lover, and painter of a man, of men, losing one era, for example when men were boys. Some of us find value in the strength and direction that are wrapped in a trust that contributes to a sense of confidence, security, and security. Yes, they do not do like that! But then how often you get women who are doing like Kiss Derek.
