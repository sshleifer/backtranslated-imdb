I love this movie because it's a fine job in movies, made by people who care enough to do it art and not just home movies. He is full of Greg Noll's super-surfer movie, with a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. But he has expanded to the degree that he approaches the aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talents, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing must be athletic. Surgery is not astronaut or test pilot. Neither are meds (perhaps) or Ph.d (again, perhaps). He believes in the quest of the surfer. He believes in the beauty of human goofiness. He believes in the great gift of peace, from the ceasefire. Surfer celebrates suspended from war on the north beach in a Hawaiian island attacked by zero Japanese fifteen years earlier. It celebrated time down to a country that fought a war-cold war instead of a hot war - and socialist Russia. Navigation is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only a little historic. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrating his browsing technique. He went out and conquered a dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. This movie does not have military heroes. He has no weapons. The only beach-top surfers to conquer have a beer-stand and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is happy in excitement.
