War Inc. is a comic but strange movie. The actors are likable, the movie is also remarkable, but I do not know how to describe the scheme. I will go into the scheme later on. This is a movie with some odd dependent choices. In addition to John Cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in empty blank blankets that I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is odd. There is a scene where he sticks a scorpion down his pants. And hit on Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist to the end that involves the two characters. It makes sense. <br /> This is the only choice I'll get in. Cause it just plain weird. The movie all is strange. But at times incredibly funny and I've never been bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. In addition to Miss Duff. It's not great. But here we have Jan Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Look what I mean? <br /> This is the story of a hit-man named Hauser (Cusack). He was sent down to some Middle East cities to put a hit on an oil man named Omar Sheriif (by the actor). While trying to deal with her own personal problems, she helped out the wedding of a popstar (played by Hilary Duff). And he fell in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). There is something about the popstar though. Hauser is disgusting by it. There is a scene where she sings a song for her and then she throws up. The twist at the end of the movie reveals the quality of why. The thing about the twist is that I did what kind of see it came. But that does not matter. This is a strange comedy, funny, and fun comedy. I like most of the actors. So, really, how can I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
