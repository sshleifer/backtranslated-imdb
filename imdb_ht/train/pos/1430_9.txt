This was played in our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold-out so we went to this, not knowing anything about it other than being a documentary on the planet. We were very happy in our misery as this was a very powerful movie about life and the delicate balance we all shared with the rest of the inhabitants of Earth. This movie has some of the most enchanting photography I've ever seen in a movie and takes me out of the desert desert in the rain forest and looks like something I've never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student should see before becoming jaded. I'm going to encourage my niece to see this film since it will inherit the planet we left it. This is also a movie seen on a theater screen or a very large TV since the photography is so powerful and exotic.
