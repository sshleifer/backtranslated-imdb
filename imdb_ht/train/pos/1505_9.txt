"House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best anthology films of the time period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracking down a missing movie star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) found that last report was in a big castle in the country. During the course of the house, he told four different stories about past residents of the house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! His wife, (Joanna Dunham) is thrilled with the story, which center around a strangler series called Dominic. After a series of weird accidents and home experience, Charles began to believe that the creation I came to life and haunted him and his wife. Probably one of the best entries in the movie, it's easy Creepiest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes and the fictional character are really creepy, the mystery surrounding it is really effective and there's always a classic creepy-out time. This classic moment is the killing of the psychiatrist's office, which is a tall ever for creepiness. Construct it, and the sounds crack, rapid flash of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning of the ground have returned to work well for this one favor. <br /> <br /> Sweets for the sweet-moving in a new home, John Reid's widow (Christopher Lee) employee former schoolteacher Ann Norton, (Nyree Dawn Porter) for her daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks ) while it is far beyond business. Let's gradually start to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which Jan vehemently denies. When he learns the true nature of what happened, it's far more shocking than he could have thought possible. With the creepiest plotting plotting and great twist of the stories, this is a very nice entry. The mystery of the beautiful family is played out, and the small number of clues gather up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nervous-wracking. This alone part is the main reason why this one works, and Lee does not hurt her either. The bad story (Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers, (Joss Ackland) both become infused with a woman's image a wax museum, such as the image taken on life, discovered a shocking secret on the museum that prompted both of them. There's a smart site here, and it gives an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. This is no exception, and it looks strange, which helped by the blooming lighting on display on the sculptures. A sequence of dreams gives a great moment of suspicion, but that ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. It takes a long time for the events unfolding, and most of the time is spent on display. It also builds up to an end to shock that can be seen coming from a mile away. People really lower this one a bit. The twist had changed, it would have been higher, the rest is unacceptable. Cloak-Veteran film actor Paul Henderson, (Jon Pertwee) is angry at the lack of realism on the series of his new films, going to and buying a new vampire clothing from a specialty store. The coat soon turns into a vampire, goes crazy about the series and co-star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts in the house. To convince the dress is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it to just in his imagination. This has a very decent site, and there are many opportunities for decent crises, but its sinks are several factors. First, it's just too jumpy for her own good. The infamous trait of the end is a perfect example, which is so late that it's not really a shock at all, and just coming across as just plain comedy. There are some scenes of crisis or trying to scare that it's just a boring to sit down. It is one of the weakest in the movie. The final verdict: A well-known Omnibus movie, there are some small issues scattered around each of the stories that make this movie a less perfect, but always very mountable. Highly recommended for those who are in the same films at the moment or who enjoy British horror films. <br /> <br /> Rating Today - PG-13: Violence
