Another outstanding foreign film that well traces the crop never ends in passionate crud from Hollywood! This is a story of life and living. No, definitely not the perfect little life so often show off the artificial Hollywood art cinema, but rather, the real life is filled with real characters and strengths and weaknesses just as real people in our lives and ourselves. The dynamics of all life, tied to the walls of this basin, and particularly its owner-age, magnificent, touching hearts and much thought to induce. <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax, and be carried away in this simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to learn from this movie if you only open yourself up to it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
