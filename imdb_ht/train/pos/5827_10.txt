This three stooges film is in a tie with my favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". This is a mess in laughing for any fan of three Stooges to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The boys are savvy in a recording studio by listening to Christine McIntyre's beautiful singing a great version of "Voices of Spring". He will offer a record deal, but he is scarred to be honest with his father on his choice of a career and prove himself as a real singer. When she and others leave the studio, the stooges decided to have a little fun and play her record with curly dress up as Christine. Checkers in Christine's quotes can see Curly and her mistake for Christine and invite Curly songs for her party. Of course, there is someone who was angry at the party and destroyed his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get back to them. stoke flick, that should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
