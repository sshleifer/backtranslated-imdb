I still enjoy watching this when it comes to television for the first time every year in the 60's. It's a typical story of Hollywood story, dramatize, stylized and full of blunders but so, it's an entertaining movie with a good looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this rumor in his 1938 film. His son, Anthony Quinn actor who had Belou's support of the film '38 is the director of his first director and swan song as he never led a movie before and never would again. DeMille has gathered a team that has recently worked on its 10th commands to help Quinn pull it off including DeMille's long-standing producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also in 10 commands are seniorist Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd director of Arthur Rosson, art director Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, director of Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester as a costume design team received only the Oscar nomination of the Buccaneer. A great cast here at DeMille team was directed by Yul Brynner as boat Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President Andrew Jackson. Also at the disposal are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours it drags in some spots, but make up for it with some excellent fighting scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
