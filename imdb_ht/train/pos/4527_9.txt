One of the ten best comedians ever <br /> This looks like a comedy so joyous and light song. Komaton Keaton are _innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. <br /> <br /> Beautiful fun, deliberately delightful and inventive, must go to a draft of a ten Top Ten if I was looking for one. A triangular love story will enchanted viewers; I want to bring this approach to this Keaton comedy is like DESTINY the head tongue ?? Down ?? or updating reversals. Again a couple traverses the waters of time ?? and in the era of the Stone Age, in Rome and at times the Keaton in a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in both movies, one, a gloomy, unusual melody; - the other, a light, virtuously ?? rhythm comedy. In Keaton it's essentially the same couple; and maybe it is the same as Language. The babe wants by both Buster and Beery is beautiful. I found three AGES well-written and intelligent, without incredibly sophisticated; The draw is basically very populous ?? like ?? The babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two men Keaton and Beery rival. <br /> <br /> Keaton's movie is simply enormously likable, and perhaps one should tempt to assert this looks ambitious? yet it's not, but it's great fun, great fun, fun enough. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.
