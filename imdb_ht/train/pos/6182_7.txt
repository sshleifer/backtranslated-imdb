The mystery of this murder and music numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short of suspicion and plausibility. Based on a stage playing by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, he combined a whodunit scheme with a backstage ambiance (an homicide investigation takes place on night opening in the theater where a music show was performed). Throwing is impressive and varied: hard-jump Victor McLaglen as the police officer who investigates and never fails to skip idiotically at whatever showgirl is going through the eyes; Jack Oakie (Jack Lemmon's Caution or Jack Oakman's Jack Lemmon Posthumous?) As the director shakes up to be coordinating performance at the scene as well as the chaos behind the scenes; Jessie Ralph all-time like a wardrobe mistress, deep black; Dorothy Stickney, who has a stunning monologue close-up near the end, as the trembling maid maid of love and the male lead; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as the lead male, the classic warbling "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatively delivering "Where are from and where to go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; The glorious power of Gertrude Michael, which separates from us too soon, as a wet showgirl whose love for Brisson is spoiled; usually ridiculous Toby Wing here is at least the center of a joke-getting jokes running. <br /> <br /> When the complications are drawn to get out of hand there is an interesting scene or fun and tune music tune in to distract the viewer. The most shaken film film is the "Marahuana" number, led by Michaels, but aside from its controversial story, it is truly one of the lesser music offerings. All the songs here are staged as though they might actually have fit into a standard space theater prosenium, as opposed to the setup of Fantasy Cinemas in the Berkeley Busby style.
