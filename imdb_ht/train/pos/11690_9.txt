This movie was dead to see. Well it took until now decided to actually rent it. It was completely worth it. This movie makes me laugh at the beginning of the end. Chris Rock is funny no matter what his movie is in. However, this should become the real closet of his greatest. If you look urine for a family movie, it means pre-adolescent and up then this one u can not pass.
