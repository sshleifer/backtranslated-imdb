Put the UFO "stuff" aside. This was the best documentary I had seen. Reality reports by Neil and Buzz ... a must see. The interviews and reports are a revelation since most of the information was confidential confiscated in 1969 and only released in 2006. No documentary on date has details or accuracy for this a short 47 minutes ... FAKTS will blow you away, and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest hero of our time. Have you ever seen someone save his own life? Do not bet. Neil saves her life when only milli-seconds separates her from death. Amazing to look. It is a travesti person not known all the details associated with landing on the moon and those courage those had when facing certain deaths, from a failing computer ... 10 stars!
