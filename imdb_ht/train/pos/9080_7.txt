Maybe I need to have myself examined, but I thought this was a very good movie.the CG is not too bad.I saw worse.the look of the animals (and by my creature I mean the good and the snake bad) was very cool.The stage scene involving the snakes was really good, I thought.there are some things in logic at times, and the story does not always make sense. But for a feature of animals, there is a lot to get mal.a many of the other creatures seemed to rise from other cinemas, so it is not entirely original.I think the belief in the story is original if.there is a bit of similarity to Godzilla (the Big Budget American version) liked a lot.i did not like this movie as much, but I always said it was very good.I also loved the music. All of the, I think dragon war is about a 7/10
