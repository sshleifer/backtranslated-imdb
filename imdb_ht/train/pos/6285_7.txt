What's a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer expect to be completed with action. <br /> In Bruckheimer's latest movie producer, go in 60 seconds, all on nomenclature. With moniker characters such as Kip, Sway and Sphinx and idealized cars with names like Diane, Sue and Eleanor's elusive, it's the only non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the game name. Not a deep script by any means, but it's a great machine for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis rain, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, from car-thievery to take retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of 1974 hit the cult, this film can not be destined for the same cult but it is fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching by the act. Although packed with stars, none of them have outstanding performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite and comrades, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, coming to have his recent Oscar, is just a love interest sign and hardly any time screen. <br /> <br /> Are a series of beautiful cars and cars chases to become involved in making a big movie? I think so. The movie is a pleasure to look at and although a particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelief, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling. Just be cautious of other drivers fighting for a pole position while leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
