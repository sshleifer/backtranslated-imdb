If you are tired of films trying too hard to be story fairy (the "beautiful wife" variety of love story), here is a beautiful movie in which a Japanese businessman is pulling free from his robotic life, dispassionate when he falls into love .. and dance. Character really drawn brings life into a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving.
