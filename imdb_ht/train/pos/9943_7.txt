The film never claims to be something spectacular as many films do. These films are accessible as a fun and fun time. And that's exactly what it was. It is the Korean version of a Man Bring It On. <br /> From the go get you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it will end, but the fun is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the movie is a copy of carbon to another. Instead, the fun is held on the journey to how the remaining 2 "thugs" became the people of their own right. Therefore, the movie is fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The camera work, especially the Dolly moves were very well executed. The script, being a weak tad, was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2-dimensional but full of life and desires. This film will not have any Oscars, nor any sales blockbuster DVD, but a fun look and a fun experience.
