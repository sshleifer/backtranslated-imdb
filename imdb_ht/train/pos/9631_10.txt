A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys came to sweep the chimneys into the house of Prophet Noodle, a mad scientist who's just rejuvenated serum rejuvenation. Stan & Ollie continued with their hard work, spreading indoors indoors and on the roof. Then the teacher wants to try out his new potion ... <br /> A very funny little movie. The finish is a bit abrupt, but many of the slapsticks leading up to it are terrific. Especially good is Stan & Stan's competition in the opposite end of the stack. This Lucien Littlefield as the teacher.
