A summary threw good at a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think this is how it might have been like. I think there are two typically American obvious points in the movie: 'Communist' and parallel Adolf Hitler. These should be obvious to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe performs a great performance, and so does many well-known actors. The last few minutes of the film is unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after normal. (That's why it's so awful - it all happened, and it probably looked just like that). But actually, did the scene on the station really take place?
