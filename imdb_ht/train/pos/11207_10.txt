This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it's not in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I did not see it listed in quite a while. * Sigh * Most recommended.
