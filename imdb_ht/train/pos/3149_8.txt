Not since the Simpsons did it at first had a sitcom that I did not want to turn in in a matter of 2 minutes. It was of course said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one though. <br /> <br /> The first season was so like the young characters were not quite as outrageous as they later came. They even went to school sometimes. These season are the character where to jump out. Eric, the sarcastic twig, Donna, his levelheaded girlfriend, Kelso, the Tumor bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-puppet punk, Fez, the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie, spoils rich foul. As for the adult characters had Eric's mother, "you can believe it is so ditzy" Eric's suburban mother, the right arrow which of course was not such a tough ass as it looked like Donna's goofy dad and her mother dumb blonde. Everyone is true to the characters but special koodos Kurtwood Smith who find the perfect balance between stiffness and always make the Red Forman him quite sympathetic without causing us to throw recklessly unexpected. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. He is a tough character to play because he does not allow the actor to appreciate in wild overacting like the Kelso character, played by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interacting because they are different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because it is much more realistic and we really need to see the orphan history for the omega-time, although I'll say that the writers have come up with a brilliant story brilliant for him in the past seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by artist Green Guy Artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and has a nail on a kind of voice board, which actually suits his character. The sad part only is that we have not seen more scene with him and Eric because they are ...... hilarious together. There have been too many stories that have been wasted on her relationship problems since we have already received that in pearl with Eric and Donna. Last I will say that the casting of actors invited were still great. A few favorites: Fez 'humongous girlfriend in the mid-season, pastor Dan, Leo is totally frightened by Thomas Chong's even awesome pair, another one of Fez' totally certified and a special appearance by Sabrina in young witch as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Come back on Fox, whatever.
