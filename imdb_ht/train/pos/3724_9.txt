Tigerland follows life of a newly-shot group of soldiers who called up battle in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, America knows they are fighting a fight, and the director takes us into a 16mm film documentary shot shot in life to recruit several of the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. The film is more of a character study no real draw, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dislodged yet clever man, who only wants to escape the camp. We took into several characters of the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> I should say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Great act, and very memorable. Also, the director uses film and style works well, causing it looks like a lot like the old movie footage you still see regarding Vietnam. Its bigger picture shows how the film shows that all the infighting and issues were so important in the issues of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz moves away from a training mission where an instructor shows how to use a radio as a torture device just about sum up everything about war in a nutshell ... and it's worth noting. Fantastic movie. Not just about Nam, but on whom to decide what morally right when they were 'in the army'. <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
