* What I like about SPOILERS * Teens Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan and her dad; but she does not know that half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friend Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), Henry companion (Michael McMillian), broke Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie Jeff's companion (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighters then husband) Vic (Dann Cortese), Lauren sticking to a cheek (Leslie Grossman) and second Boss Peter (?) If you do not have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; If you love only this sophisticated comedy veeeery this is not for you; If you like a funny, sometimes touching show of two hot chicks who can act in the lead (and no other than Fabulous 'Mary Cherry' in Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then Hell is you waiting for? You are welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
