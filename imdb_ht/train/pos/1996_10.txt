Simply put, Oliver! is one of the greatest musical of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" in just a few names - and even memorable characters. The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel and much like the story of Oliver Twist himself, it is a perfect family movie. There are some awesome moments - wicked Sykes Bill played by Oliver Reed is scary enough on his own - but in general, the movie is appealing to children of all ages as well as adults. Almost everybody is usually familiar with now - turning around an orphan orphan named Oliver and his growing life in London. At first, she lived in the worker with the rest of her fellow orphan, but after being dared to answer Mr. Bumble, the overseer, he was sold to a family as a servant. <br /> After a series of male and shaving sharks, she meets the artificial dodger - superbly played by a young Jack Wild, who gives her all the role - and in her, the vicious fagin (Ron Moody) , who train young boys to choose their pocket treasure that he holds for himself. The film was shot only in studio and sounds in Shepperton Film Studios but not translated into all films. Devices are perfectly replicated Victorian London, as the costumes are torn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a massive success on his release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best music ever and will delight anyone who loves film.
