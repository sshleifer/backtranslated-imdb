Remember H.G. Wells' The "Invisible Man"? Well here's another movie like it, only more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes out of the world in invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first the serum was the easy part, making the person come back was not. Most of the attempts first ended unstable. Up to one night, when he had the formula. And to others, but Caine would have to beat the lab. The gorilla was the first and almost dead, so when it came, it was a close one. So, when Caine did, she decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of failing to see, the team tried best to bring him back to the world of the body. However, the visibility formula happens by working the way it should be, and Caine would dig into madness. So it ends up being a single invader killer invisible. It would be best just to get out of town instead of taking the lives of people close to you. I would care less about those who hurt you. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
