This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes me on a roller coaster in emotions. I laugh and cry and get lousy and happy and in love! All this in a little over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! I have mentioned the leading actor of course, Michael Nyquist. It does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays Gore, who plays this mentally-challenged young man in a compelling way! It sort of remember me in Leonardo di Caprios roll in Gilbert Grape! Then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's scene. <br /> I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
