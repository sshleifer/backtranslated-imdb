All the actors are in the right place.Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, the shrill and a little secret.Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific. Keith Gordon as his son Peter is brilliant.Nancy Allen as Liz Blake the girl called is fantastic.Dennis Franz performs its typical detective role.Inside Marino it is one of the most colorful in this movie.There are many of the creepy scenes of this elevator movie.Settle Elevator is one of them. There have been comparisons between this and the psycho Alfred Hitchcock (1960) .Some similarities between these two movies.There in these movies can cause some sleepless nights.
