This movie is done in its simplest and best. <br /> I was skeptical, because Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he gets involved with bad projects; This is not one of those times. <br /> It's a small story that runs just about an hour and fifteen, at a time when we're getting used to making films longer and longer, and not necessarily better, the director uses the short time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the beginning (large portrait by freeman and Vega by the way), which little of info info about them looks like, Morgan is himself even though his name Not to mention, she came from movies for a couple of years now because she was saturated by the business, she developed a pair to commit to a script, and she's looking for a character in an independent movie where she plays a shop / grocery store manager. The story begins by him being the drop in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood, where he meets the checkout of the 10 or less items (Vega) and has taken a ride and the cause of his "production" . br> <br /> In many ways it is a road movie, Morgan gives laughter, and curious with its unbeatable smile and positive perspective on everything, showing off an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define Everyone she sees in a character she can play, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinary beautiful woman, even more gorgeous than Penelope Cruz) brings vulnerability to a 25 year old woman who works harder than all others without getting any credit to a dead end work in an objectionable supermarket. <br /> It's a talkie, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and sad and sad is well-sustained, the characters become so lovable right away that you spend the last 20 minutes begging More time screen in thi is the odd couple, but the cow is in the nature of the story, so it was a good appeal to the director not to give in.
