You sit there for half an hour and watch a story, believe it all, then watch another half an hour in the same story completely unmatched ... and then join again. Brilliant. One of the most exciting films in the San Francisco Festival International Festival is a documentary. I do not know if - other than Andrew Jarecki's "capturing Friedmans" - was never anything like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $." It features, exposes, advocates, reveals, and questions everything about Norma Khouri, the author of "Honor Objects," accelerated and lambasted 2001 bestsellers on honors in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is very incredible and what makes the movie so exceptional is that this "exposure" of Khouri was made with the full involvement of Khouri. <br /> <br /> For the initial portion of the movie, Khouri presents his story about the honorable slaughter of a friend in his body in Amman, the book's story. It sounds completely credible, convincing. Then his story was taken apart, exposed, not eminently credible and convincing, such as women's rights activist in Jordan, the investigator's reporter and in Australia, where Khouri stayed for a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri comes back and refuses the charges, taking a test of success-detector success in the process. There is another segment of devastating exposure - not to be specified here because that would reduce the value of shock ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the allegations (not all, but are essential to the affairs the book). /> <br /> And the Houdini act continues, and round the round of this heavy-weight, swarms of fighting prices, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of the resolution. Brilliant.
