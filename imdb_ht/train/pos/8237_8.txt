For my life, why does this movie receive a rating R? While it is about to feed, believe it or not, it's actually a very good family-friendly movie - at least if your kids are ages 10 or older. Unlike the traditional zombie films, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional value - albeit somewhat twisted! The language is not a serious problem, no stripping and the movie style definitely geared towards children (much like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - yet some knucklehead slapped a single R rating! Believe me, most kids have seen violence worse than that and just seems strange to hear that it's just an adult film. <br /> The story is set in a parallel-type world. While the mods, cars and motherboards appeared about 1953, in this bizarro world there was a bad weather that caused the "zombie war" and massive changes in daily life. At school, children are trained in armed combat and have a nice late stage in the movie where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep him in his backpack "just in case"! As for life outside the school, it's very strange as well, as people now learned that the zombies are NOT such a bad thing! Heck, using traumatic necklaces and training, can be done in slaves that can do housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really ill guy, be your "special friend". This movie deals with one particular family who ultimately buys the first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). The happy mother and her son slowly become friends of the zombie. Father, on the other hand, is not convinced - as he forced years early to kill his own zombie dad and he has not gotten off this! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie needs to be seen by a wider audience.
