This short cartoon about sketch, but is a visually stunning piece of work. It will be very, very minor deflators: <br /> This short has a "story" that's incredibly small-underground gloom that is responsible for the return of spring every year, but must beg to a winter not yet ready to remove it. Both gnomes and storms have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot - it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, as bright colors were always something of a gift and some incredible work inspired here. My favorite short moments surround the movement of the liquid colors in pipes. In more than one point, there are a series of tapes aligned in a row, from the shorter to the highest and the colors move through the pipes and the music track to make it seem as if the row is a pipe org. <br /> The visuals in the battle between emerging vegetation and the winter storm that refuse to leave slowly are extremely well executed. These types of shorts are the things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead the ultimate departures of MGM, because this cartoon probably went on budget and MGM finally decided that they could control better spending if the animation department was managed by someone a little more aware of the expenses that Harman and Ising were. <br /> <br /> This is really a cute cartoon and is well worth seeing. It is available on the DVD attack of the 30 'characters. Recommended, particularly if you like good animation.
