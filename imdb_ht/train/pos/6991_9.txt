This is an excellent movie. Throw is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. The film is basically about a well-accomplished physician robbing the bodies of dead brides and taking them home. Once the body of her house, she removed items (I hate to use such a general term, but I forgot what she was removing) and put it in his wife holding her young. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why brides have been killed. She takes a trip to the doctor's house and exciting things start to take place. Definitely watch this oldie but goodie if you can.
