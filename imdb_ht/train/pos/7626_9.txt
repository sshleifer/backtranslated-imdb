I loved this movie since I saw it in 1979. I'm always amazed at how correctly Kurt Russell shows Elvis, right down to how he moves and expressions on his face. Sometimes its scary how it looks, acts, and talks like real Elvis. Fortunately this was released on DVD, so all of us who were waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film. I've heard the opponents, saying that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think keep in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that's TV shows (just two years after Elvis's death!) that he did a good job with that. In fact I have not seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one. Very recommended.
