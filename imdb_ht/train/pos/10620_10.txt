When they first looked, I found this story to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie camps. After many more, I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are very bad, especially the song, but two things stand out that make the movie, even the song, refreshing. One in the direction of the art. Like other film cannons, this is a beautifully decorated period; Each piece of cloth and jewelry (both of which have a large part to draw this movie) look fresh and new, with contrast to the plain clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song I found myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, beautiful to do. The other thing is the funny distribution. A lot of the movie is cheese, but worth the emperor (and his pleasure to himself to the end), the suspect guard, the guard pursued Nicholas, and the stupid master, are all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous well on purpose. And the sequence during the Weave-O song makes up for the songs that were not good.
