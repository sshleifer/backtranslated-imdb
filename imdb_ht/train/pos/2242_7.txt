Partially from the need to know, one feels, include a conventional love story of the plot to make the film more marketable in the 1950s movie public. The movie begins with some silly characters characteristic of the top-class bureaucrats running the Foreign Office --- The British are pilloried by the way that only British can be pregnant. But later, the film wandered into a conventional trail college. Terry-Thomas looks as always, but the great talent of the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted. <br /> A defeat, but not great movie.
