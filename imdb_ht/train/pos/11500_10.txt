If Mulder was looking for his real father here he is Darren McGavin, X first record, mercilessly he was only one season the producers of this show did not know that they were made in a classic on the hands and in 1993 joined Chris Carter and what I called the track up to the Night Stalker, X Records. Both will go down as classic is my opinion of shows taking viewers to a level of experience that only comes together once in a while and who should appear in the later XX years Darren McGavin, as Agent Arthur Dales help our favorite hero, solve their case. Paying homage to the man I think, well done to Chris Carter brings back a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if he did not watch the X files and showing particular i would never known on the night Stalker.
