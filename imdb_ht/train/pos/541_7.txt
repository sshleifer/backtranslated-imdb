As a sequel, this is not a bad movie.i actually loved it better than the 1st.iI found it more fun.it seemed like it was injection document style.at first to bother me, just as I thought he just looked too low budget. But he grew up on me, and he made the movie look like more authentic movies. That's more dry Materio cover than the original, which is good, in my opinion. Think of the times have gone a bit on the top and some of the scenes and characters.It almost become a parody of himself, which can be movie at point.this at least some suspense, which one of the first There is, in my view.it I have some of the same great music from the original, which is great.the act again was very decent for the most part, though as I said, some of it seemed on top and it also feels that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and has a few minutes that looks really slow and just does not seem to leak, like the rest of the movie.overall, though, I thought this was a fenm.m end up y rating for "Back to Cabin by the Lake" is 7/10 *
