Celebrating the Limerick: <br /> If a man could return from the dead <br /> And live in a girl's head <br /> <br /> Revenge she would find <br >> < / For the murder he met <br /> <br /> Not the guy who's now in his wife's bed. <br /> For me founded Again is a very under-rated classic, episode that makes up a part of what's being defined by the X-Files before I started watching it. I've seen a few segments before the first show came on and I was very much too small to watch it as part of the Devil's Jersey, but I very much appreciated watching this episode as a 11 year old and They were absolutely eliminated from the stage where the guys became choking at the death of the bus and then the hypnosis scene and the little girl. I told you I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura on it now in the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy. It's enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws of the plot as to why the girl had to wait until he was 9 before his mind before his life really began to exact his revenge. Or what he did just randomly sit on a bus in the night. You would think that his parents would have been worried. And maybe we just did not really see this part of the story. And was it with the telekinesis? Other than adding the Carrie really cool factor to the already creepy story, there really was not any kind of good explanation for her. But even with its little flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and there is little to no reason that I do not like it. 10 out of 10.
