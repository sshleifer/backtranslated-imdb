Touch and sad movie. Showing the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling crash. The center film on her relationship with her married lover, whom she is often very hostile towards, and his interaction with other accident victims, particularly a black down-and-out with a white-supremacy biker. The film is often funny, often sad, and always credible. Get out the box in the kleenex and watch this on a cozy lunchtime afternoon with your partner.
