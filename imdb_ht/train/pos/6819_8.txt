I found 'time at the top' a fun and exciting experience. The acting, while not generally brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film obviously aimed at the least demographic, it is certainly one of the best works of the genre (Sci Fi Fi -). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for kids, and 'Time at the Top' does nothing to this theory! I do not think that continuity and great acting are important to younger ones. A good draw and a imaginative scenario are far more important. Both are in abundance in this film. Special effects are good, without distraction of the story, or close the viewers to their own imagination. It would be very easy to inject a SFX file into this movie, but it would totally destroy all 'Dwarf Grapes'. <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are in a very high standard of this movie, and complement the closet wardrobe with historical accuracy. In general, this film is very satisfactory, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world in the eyes of the children, or those who try, like myself! Now I really have to read the original book, as soon as possible.
