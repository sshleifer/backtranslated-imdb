This is one of the biggest 80s movies !! He knocked out like a "turd of a punchbowl" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine denounced it or whatever. But they proudly put their names on a show with "Stuart", "I speak-a-no-including Chinese ladies" and "guy ups of speed". What's up with that? And I love Ron Leibman-he's foxy! Ask why was his name removed from the credits? It was her roles that I know. Of course, it's not as foxy as it was in Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie is right up with the National Holiday Lamp. If you liked movies such as Porky, Fast Times, Last Indian Virgin, or any of the other 80-year-old teen movies, you'll love this one !! Rent it and you will see what I mean !!
