Second anxious young woman's anxiety in London desperate for a job, happy to accept live-in secretary positions with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers on the people being caught in a house against them will always make me a little uncomfortable - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this rather stylish B-movie is neither stiff nor claustrophobic. It's far-fetched and easy, but not worthwhile, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. Achieving this in 1986 (as "dead in winter") proved wise, as plot-elements are not in the modern-day. "Julia Ross" is very compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But she stops the neck nicely until a tightest, feels a little sloppy. *** from ****
