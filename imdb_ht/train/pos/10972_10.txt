I've only seen it recently, but was aware of it for a number of years and was always intrigued by its title. She now makes me like one of my very loving films. It is difficult to describe the incredible Maysles subject to discovering everything else in its beautiful work. It has many memorable images and moments where you feel overwhelmed in a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it. It is as if the filmmakers have cast a spell at the audience and draw us into the strange world of the unique Beales, a true aristocratic family. She had a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could have away it all, cooking my corn on the cob in my bedside table. It had a time of sadness that was inferior to all. A falling out of magnitude for this family is once estimated. The money went away, but time and grace remained, as well as their beauty. He drew me out of the first frame and long after the end movie I found myself asking about their fate. Asked that if I took a walk along East Hampton Beach I would still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Edie's dancing in the window behind the hanging hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
