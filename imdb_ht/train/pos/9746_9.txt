Well, let's face it. This is a God-terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is terrible, the act is worse. But the movie was made for a reason and one reason only, like all those terrible Mario Lanza movies ... just heard the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his prime . Okay, so Lanza movies were also an excuse for her to hit on women, but this film is about to hear Luciano. That alone is worth watching the movie. A great star opera stuck on his head faces his fears, finding humility and love on the road, and belting out a lot of hit numbers, too. <br /> I must admit my prejudice to a number of levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (who has nothing about Pavarotti who is not great, including his fan base?). And when I first saw this movie I went out on my own, see the height and depth of life's possibilities and love for the first time. So as terrible as this movie is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me deeply in life and love again. <br /> Yes, it's coral and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it all over. So I give this movie a high rating of hope that someone who never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since it is now gone. Like Italian foods that you've never tried before, try it! You can be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano guy or prospective Pavarotti peep.
