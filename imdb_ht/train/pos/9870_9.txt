With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million people in Fox animation and Blue Sky Studios has done an incredible job. <br /> They combine the state-of-the-art digital animation, perfectly cast talent to Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very fun, family movie with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and care for your fellow pig members. And how sometimes it takes many different animals to make up a herd. While watching this movie I received a strong political message about getting along with people who shared your space - maybe it would have to look for all world leaders! David Newman - yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - gives a superb non-intrusive note to use to move the action together, and, at times, is positively tapping toe. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the movie is incredible; a colored interior, unusual fantasy landscapes of snow, geysers, mud, rock and ice. The individual characters were also credibly credible too, and the facial expressions of Ray Romano ?? Manfred 'was a particular treat. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence and DoDos are leaving no doubt as to where the expression 'dumb as a DoDo comes out. '' '' '' '' '' is a good family movie that keeps things up to being alarmed or scared of pretty well-sounded kids - but real however. <br /> It should be a great movie to see in the theater and buy for your home.
