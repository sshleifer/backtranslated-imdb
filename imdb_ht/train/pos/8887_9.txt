As I saw the movie I was really shocked to see what the 60 was about. I know I can be wrong about some things, but it looks like the 60 really had an effect on people in the allotted time. Some people said they wanted to go back to 60's. From what I saw I would say yes to the excitement and there is no for the result. But this is my opinion.
