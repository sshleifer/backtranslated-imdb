Warning: there is a spoiler. Corky plot and in many cases awful acts. Fontaine is great, but there are some others, particularly Richard Ney, ivy's husband, and many wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of poisoning and sanitizing, and hair in place. But the movie is so juicy and so thrilling. More faithful to the book than most movies in his day. Joan Fontaine casting as a poison (with an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke. It's just it's usual Joan Fontainey self. As thieves were supposed to die, he died not falling "first foot to the floor in a blank space."
