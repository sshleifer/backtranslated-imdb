I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was in the office working on the weekend and the TV was over for background noise. But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I would never see or hear from them until I was completely absorbed. A subject of life & death (British title - Heavenly staircase in the US) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one perfect-written, well-acting, perfectly-managed package. It's a classic that really ran right up there with Casablanca, It's a beautiful life, Gone with the wind, Kane's citizens, & Firefighters. WHERE he never received the same public notice and the presence of video-store? Fortunately, some knowledge critics have put it on "Top 100 Forever" list. There is hope - Fantasia in 1940 did not hit the 'til' 60s, and the Wizard of Oz was a dude in the box office, but made a hit by TV. Buy it - rent it - look it - its request! You will not be disappointed!
