Rated E <br /> I've never actually owned a 64 Nintendo but I've played a lot many times. In my opinion along with Conkers Bad Day Fur, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game many times with its good every time.If you have a N64 and no this game you should try to find it.Oryan's Super Mario Bros. games have been side scrolling games but Super Mario 64 have a 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment.The game is sort of weird but there are plenty of things you can do in the game.You play as Super Mario and once again you must save Princess and the 120 stars power out Bowzer.Now you can do it in a 3D environment.Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
