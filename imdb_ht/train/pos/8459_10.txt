I'm not a big fan of the most animated, but Gundam Wing is really something else. Gundam Wings lacks all of the stereotyped melodies that you might think of when you think the animated, since the number of jokes made about 17 hours would only be in the double digits, Gundam Wing gets right down to business. Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is a series of actions. Large parts focus on the diplomatic tracts of a war, not just the battles. Even if fighting animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it might be just a pain of enema, individual duels between the gundams are almost pieces of art considered the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid motion. <br /> <br /> For my knowledge, this episode 49 plus one set of films has been picked up by cartoon network in 2000, and then professional armed them too. The duplication is simply flawless. Not only does each word say to match up, but the voices used really make the characters more credible. many believe it's best to look animated and aboard in English, but I simply do not have the determination to do that. <br /> <br /> Not only are the good voices, but the score used on the series is quite impressive. I'll just say he let me scramble in vain to find a band. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some primal time drama like the Lost Objects made for the purpose of your skating. explains the plot deeply would lead to many vectors, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes in the series. The toughest idea of ​​the series is that the earth and its space colonies now independently have difficulty keeping peace. So a war started, leading to military coups and elaborating diplomatic situations. I feel that any detail would begin to give away information, which is critical to the scheme. <br /> I'll end up here saying that this series is great for anyone who loves anime, anyone who thinks ANY anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone who gets involved with anime grave tone of it.
