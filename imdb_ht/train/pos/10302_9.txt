This film is the best movie Jim Carrey has ever done. Carrey did not have the normal face of doing this movie. It was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in her life. Then God came down from heaven and gave his power to Bruce. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actors / actresses. The plot was good because it had a lot of penalty at the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dog) as well as sad ("break-up"). The script worked well, too. I'm glad they made an end to this movie. I missed this movie a 9/10.
