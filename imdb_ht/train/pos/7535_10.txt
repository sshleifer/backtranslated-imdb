The 700 Club provides a great outlook on world events. Some have described it as influential or cheese. I find the program for informative and inspirational. It is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that proved to be so successful. There are very few shows that can be shown in a 40 year track record of the world's success in television media and the 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been saying that somebody should kill, I find it curious that many people will literally travel over their heads to hop on the movement of criticism. I certainly said some crazy things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he set out a great show.
