ROLLING is a nice little movie. Toby Malone plays a 18 year old kid (very well-acting, by the way) who's soccer. Malone's cuts take him out overnight before his big game about an adventure with many twists and turns involving gym bags, a drug master, some tricky cyclists, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keep us guessing like that the characters on which side of the law, what is in either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is. Part of it reminds me of LOCK CLOCK and Smoking Barrels. <br /> For me, ROLL reinforces three views that I already have before seen ROLL. Those views are: 1. I really want to go to Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool place for a vacation. <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian. Cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive. I liked the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes. <br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!
