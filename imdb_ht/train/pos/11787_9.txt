It's a short film from David Lynch and just 8 minutes, but he has received all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It's mysterious, dark, irresponsible, weird, and weird; and before the blonde girl starts to talk it even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also disaster and mystic ?? <br /> On the environment itself, it does not have the "traditional" curtains red, but it has socking purple painted walls, which gives it an equally beneficial effect on the ground. plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help; Then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's just because of her fault ?? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? he ended up sullen and puzzling, like a good Lynch movie to be finished! <br /> <br /> It's a great short, despite some amateur acting. The girls are professional actress, but I think they might have been better in this short.
