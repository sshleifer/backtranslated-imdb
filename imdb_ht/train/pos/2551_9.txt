This was almost unknown gem based on a French farces - showing, and I mean that as a compliment. Caroline (Lee) being crowned by a wealthy Argentinian (Roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline has already married Anthony (Colman), who just arrived by plane and launched immediately in a public reminder that ruled over the last time Caroline decided he was in love with someone else: a dilettante-izler sculptor (Gardiner ). The movie plays Anthony's strategy story of Caroline's uncounting from his sculpture, and how does this experience help him with his Argentinean. <br /> It is perfectly cast: Ronald Colman is in its most sophisticated and good, Reginald Gardiner is in his most priggish, Gilbert Roland is in his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just delightful capricious. The film is beautifully directed by Lewis Milestone (also produced); The whole production feels like a job of love. There are wonderful touches, such as Colman crushed frame and addressing the camera, with exceptional use of a bar-cabinet door. It's a sin that he has not released on DVD - this is the kind of movie that can singlehandedly awaken interest in classic film.
