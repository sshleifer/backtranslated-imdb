Although this was obviously a low-budget production, the performances and songs in this movie are worth seeing. One of the role of some Walken in music to date. (she is a wonderful dancer and singer and she demonstrates her acrobatic skills as well - look for the cartwheel!) Also begins Jason Connery. The story of a great child with characters very likable.
