I saw this first movie back in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone looking at this movie. You will not regret. It well acted out, so real and never a dull moment. The act is superb and the place to make the movie looks like you are there. From the beginning up to the end, this movie is the kind that makes you lose your attention. The actress does an excellent job in portraying the girl who survived this terrible plane accident in the Amazon and shows how he managed to survive in the Amazon all alone. It is incredible that anyone can survive under these conditions. That's why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story to make the movie even more interesting and thinking that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming. I find this one movie that I can look over and over again with one that I never get tired of. This is indeed a compliment as I have hundreds of movies! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
