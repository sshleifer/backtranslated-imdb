I saw this film for very first time several years ago - and it was tuned at a time. It is bigger and better than J. F. K. Why do you still need to think 'Does this happen to me? Can I Become A Thousand? 'You can not turn on the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should'nt miss at any time.
