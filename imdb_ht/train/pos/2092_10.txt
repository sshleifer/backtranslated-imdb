I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni was able to play Chinese with 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I came away from the movie YES YES! He saw Muni in one movie where he was well hammy, I expect the same kind of performance here. I was happily proven. Although some may criticize him as being too small and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asian, I thought he was just right in the role. Keye Luke, if he would have given the chance to play a lead role, might have played it in the same way. <br /> I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the postponement of the palace where O Lan was once a slave. The graphic atmosphere and atmosphere of the shooting squad and the drought made this a season quite unlike other people at the same time where it was all glitz and glitter. I watched this movie from beginning to end enthralled. I can not say the same thing for the "epic" of today.
