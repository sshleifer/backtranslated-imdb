This movie is very much surprised me. I did not have much hope for her, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend too much time rehashing the past so they would not rely on the success of the old TV show to bring the movie. In general it was very fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this would be a weekly sit-com and I think I might agree with her.
