This is a really heart-warming family movie. She had brilliantly brilliant training and "acting" (if you can call it like that) as well (just thinking about the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was bad training training). The Paulie story is very well done, well-reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborate too. No more say except that this is a GREAT PHOTOS! <br /> My assessment: story 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> <My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG PHOTO PHILIPPE and very nice look!
