From the head of Robert Bloch, to the "psycho" fame, come four stories of twisters of twisters in this film Amicus, which, while not quite much fun, or frightening, as I would like, always providing for some decent genuine entertainment .. It's linked by the wrap-around story into a highly doubted Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of an important actor; He advised that this case linked to someone else by the house in which they all took place, and our films are cut and run. <br /> <br /> "Murder Method" has author Charles Hillyer (still delightful Denholm Elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, who became life. This sequence has some timely and unbiased times, and it does not cover a reasonable revelation and denial. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" star horror icon Peter Cushing as shareholders Philip Philipson, who, along with old friends Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) gets obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a grim miracle museum. The most effective in this episode is the sequel to the dream, although it's great as always to watch Cushing. The final images presented in us in this story are very shocking. <br /> <br /> The sweet sweets feature another well-loved horror star, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not treat adorable Moppet Jane (Chloe Franks) with excessive kindness, and it's up to the new companion / tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to find out why. The mystery of this episode is in particular occupying excellent; The movie makers wisely do not point their hands to come as more of a genuine trauma as we find the full truth of this happy family. Dead "moments are particularly awful. <br /> <br /> The "clause" has the most compact comedy of the card; Jon Pertwee, one of many actors played role in Dr. Who in those years is a lot of fun as a prosperous star star star star (in fact, it is the highlight of this story) that, swelling and the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film, they went out and bought his own clothes. Tell her dress has strange powers, which I dare not to reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome welcome as Pertwees' Companion; One nice example of the humor here is a known jab that was taken to none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The wrap-up story then ends in a predictable way, but still effective as Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all the warnings to give him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Underscored by the strange, striking, and unusual Michael Dress, the "bloody dung house" is a fun mix of stories; while I do not enjoy it as much as, say, "Tale from the Crypt", it's still good fun. May be directed by Peter Duffell, he moves slowly, but surely toward each of his refrigeration findings, and is certainly a good film of its kind.
