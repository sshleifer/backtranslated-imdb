Since September of last year, I have booked four to six weekly films at the Harold Washington Library, which has a very impressive DVD collection. (The HWL really is a circulating library: three quarters of its films from any given time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find the Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I'm here to report that, for David Lynch fans, eight episodes are half an hour spent well. The most remarkable features of these short pieces are the soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Embarrassing voice accent stands out. Physical violence cattle. The bird's purple and buzzing support moves along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The gathering of bit animations often kept in sync with the sound, but the band itself struck me as Lynch's primary interest in creating and distributing this task. In one way, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> That is, their situation is odd, ugly, deep, mute and funny as hell. And there is enough space to reflect on how absurd we can. I can not say that I will watch the collection again, but for anyone who reveled in the movements of Empires Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
