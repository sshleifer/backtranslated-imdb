Monte Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived back then just surf. Life was basically browsing, living, breathing, and having fun. They did not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. Their waves were the girls. I've never been on a surfboard, and it looks so hard, I do not understand how to stay on it, it makes no sense at all. This is an awesome movie and if you like surfing then you should really see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started browsing, how it enters life, who is really famous in it or ever, then you should really see it. It might be a documentary, but it is really good. -Tara F.-
