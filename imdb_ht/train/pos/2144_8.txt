A sweet and totally spacious movie, Are we Dansu? make me laugh and cry. At first, Sugiyama-San was not terribly appealing - a salary never aroused, shameful devoted to his family, but all too easily captivated by a figure in a window. The object of her mania is far and cold. But at the end of the movie, I was in love with him, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would like to see again.
